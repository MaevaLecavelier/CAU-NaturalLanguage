The java file is in LuceneProject/src
The useful libraries are: 
	- lucene-analyzers-commons-8.5.1.jar
	- lucene-core-8.5.1.jar

You can run the java file with 0, 1 or 2 options: 
 - 0: it's just ask for a query and make a query on the existing Index folder
 - 1 : '-v' activate verbose for having explanations on score
 - 1 : anything else will activate indexing
 - 2 : '-v' + anything else : will activate verbose and indexing.
