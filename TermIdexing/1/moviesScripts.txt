PAN across details in a bedroom...we see discarded
     shirts...pants...socks...and hear

                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
               Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.

                         JIM (O.S.)
               Yeah, I'm the best, baby.

     Now we see a TV...but the picture isn't clear.  Or, more
     appropriately, the picture is scrambled -- it phases in
     and out.  Bars scroll across it.  And we get occasional
     glimpses of what looks like --

                         JIM (O.S.)(CONT'D)
               ...oh -- that was a tit, tits...

     As most high-school guys know (but few will admit), it is
     possible to watch the pay channels while they're
     scrambled.  You just need a decent imagination to fill in
     the rest of the picture.  We PULL BACK to see JIM -- 17,
     short, horny.

                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
               Give it to me!  Yes!

                         JIM
               Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.

     Jim is, uh, physically involved with the scrambled babe.
     We TILT DOWN to see a small multimedia presentation next
     to Jim on his bed.  "Cosmopolitan" is open to a sexy
     model...a yearbook is open to the "girl's swim team"
     section...and a dictionary next to Jim, open to the
     "Vagina" listing, accompanied by a big vagina diagram.

                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
               Don't you love my sexy body?!

                         JIM
               I do, baby, I do.

     He frantically looks around...and grabs a tube sock off
     the floor.

                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
               You're so big!

                         JIM
               Yeah, that's right.

                         PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)
                   (deep macho voice)
               Ohhh, tell me you're a nasty girl!

     Jim is thrown off.

                         PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)(CONT'D)
               Yeahhh, you been bad, real bad!

                         JIM
               Man, shut up!

     Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door, immediately after
     which JIM'S MOM enters.  Jim scrambles and quickly covers
     himself and the dictionary with a pillow.  She's
     oblivious to his doings.

                         JIM'S MOM
               Hey, Jimmy.  I just wanted to say
               sweet dreams.

                         JIM
               Yep, okay Mom, 'night.

                         JIM'S MOM
                   (leans in to Jim)
               Kiss goodnight.

     Jim is revolted.  Very reluctantly he gives her a kiss.
     She turns to leave, and notices the TV.

                         JIM'S MOM (CONT'D)
               Is something wrong with the reception?

                         JIM
               Yeah.  Damn cable.  There's this
               nature show that I'm trying to watch.

                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
               Fuck me!  Yes!

                         JIM
               Uh...

     He hurriedly tries to change the channel with the REMOTE,
     but instead the VOLUME GOES UP.

                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
               BLOW YOUR WAD ON MY TITS!!

     Jim panics as his mom reacts, shocked.

                         JIM
                   (choking)
               Must...be...broken...

     JIM'S DAD enters.

                         JIM'S DAD
               What the heck is this?

                         JIM
               Nothing!

                         JIM'S MOM
               I think he's trying to watch one of
               the illegal channels.

                         JIM
               Jesus, Mom!  They're not illegal!
               They're pay channels.  How could a
               television channel be illegal?!  God,
               get a clue!

                         JIM'S DAD
               James, don't speak that way to your
               mother!

                         PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)
               Play with my hairy balls!

                         JIM'S DAD
               Turn that garbage off!  Give me that!

     Jim's Dad grabs for the remote, which is sitting on the
     pillow that's been covering Jim.  The pillow gets brushed
     aside -- revealing the Big Vagina Diagram, Jim with his
     shorts down, and a very strategically placed tube sock.

                         JIM'S MOM
               Oh my God!

                         JIM'S DAD
               Honey, why don't you let me handle this
               one.

     He ushers her out.  Jim's Dad is stuck there with his
     half-naked son.  Horrible, awful embarrassment.  A long,
     strained beat.

                         JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)
               Jesus Christ.  The dictionary?  Hell,
               son, I'll buy you some dirty
               magazines.

     Jim's Dad exits, shaking his head.  Jim sits agape,
     humiliated.

                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
               Oooh, spank me, daddy, spank me!

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS - DAY

     We see a Honda Accord drive by a sign at the city limits:
     "Welcome to East Great Falls, Michigan -- A Great Place
     To Be"

     EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL - DAY

     The front of the school.  KEVIN drives up in his Accord.
     He's a good-humored, good-enough-looking high school
     senior.  VICKY rides shotgun -- pretty, smart, confident.
     She's holding a large, thick envelope, with a big
     "Vanderbilt" return address on it.

                         KEVIN
               It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
               You got in.

                         VICKY
               You think so?

     She tears it open.  Pulls out a course catalog, various
     forms, and a letter which she hands to Kevin.

                         KEVIN
               "Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but
               after keeping you on the wait list for
               the past couple months, we've decided
               you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a
               100-page, full-color brochure on how
               rejected you are."

                         VICKY
               Kevin, this is serious!

                         KEVIN
               You got in.

     Vicky SCREAMS in excitement, like a girl at a Beatles
     concert.  Then she LAUGHS, and gives Kevin a big kiss and
     hug.

                         VICKY
               I love you!

     She hugs Kevin tighter -- as he looks a little frazzled,
     almost perfunctorily returning the hug.

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - MORNING

     Jim has met up with CHRIS OSTREICHER -- "OZ" -- a cocky
     senior with a football-player build.  He cradles a ball
     in a lacrosse stick.

                         OZ
               Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's
               any channel that should be illegal,
               it's whatever that women's channel is.
               Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some
               shit.

                         JIM
               Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little
               Mermaid on TV the other night?  That
               Ariel, whew.

                         OZ
               She's a mermaid, dude.

                         JIM
                   (trumping him)
               Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.

                         OZ
               She's a cartoon, dude.

                         JIM
               A hot cartoon.

                         OZ
               Is there anything you don't jerk off
               to?

                         JIM
               C-Span?

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALLWAY - DAY

     Jim and Oz, now joined by Kevin, walk down the hall.  Oz
     bounces the lacrosse ball off a locker, catching it
     again.  Kevin speaks a little distantly, unnerved.

                         KEVIN
               Then she said -- she loves me.

                         OZ
               Oh shit dude, the L-word!

                         JIM
               And you said...

                         KEVIN
               Nothing, I just hugged her back.

                         JIM
               You think she was serious?

                         KEVIN
               I couldn't tell -- She could've meant
               like, "I love you grandma" or "I love
               you Vanderbilt."

                         OZ
               Just don't bring it up, hang low,
               maybe she won't mention it again.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

     The guys pass by a GROUP OF BAND DORKS, most notable of
     which is MICHELLE, who proudly polishes her flute.

                         MICHELLE
               And what we should do today, in band?
               Instead of playing our instruments
               regularly?  We should play them
               backwards!  That'll be so funny!

     The Band Dorks LAUGH and agree, "hilariously" attempting
     to play their instruments from the wrong end.  The guys
     shudder.

                         OZ
                   (to Jim)
               You guys got the Latin homework?

                         JIM
               No -- Kevin, you?

                         KEVIN
                   (offended)
               Please.
                   (then)
               We're all golden, we're college bound.
               I figured it out -- I can get a c-
               minus in every class, and it's not
               gonna make a difference.  U of M, here
               I come.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL NEAR POP MACHINE - DAY

     Vicky is talking with JESSICA, a friend of hers, getting
     a pop (we're in the Midwest now, gang) from the machine.

                         VICKY
               Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.

                         JESSICA
               Yeah right.

                         VICKY
               What?  We both have cars.

                         JESSICA
               Yeah but, no offense, you're talking
               about a post-high school, long-
               distance relationship, and you and
               Kevin haven't even done it yet.

                         VICKY
               That's not why we're going out.

                         JESSICA
               What the hell are you expecting him to
               drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and
               cookies?

                         VICKY
               Jessica!  He'll drive there for me,
               and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him.
               We're going to have sex when he's
               ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be
               completely perfect.  I want the right
               place, the right time, the right
               moment.

                         JESSICA
               Vicky, it's not a space shuttle
               launch, it's sex.  So did you do the
               physics write-up?

                         VICKY
                   (offended, a la Kevin)
               Please.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

     Kevin, Jim, and Oz are still walking down the hall.
     PAUL FINCH, preppy, eccentric, is sitting on a bench.

                         JIM
               There's our man.

                         KEVIN
               Finch, you got the Latin homework?

                         FINCH
               Non habeo.  Canis meus id comedit.

     The guys keep staring.  A beat.

                         KEVIN
               Whatever.

     Someone is HOLLERING down the hall.  Running towards Oz
     is STEVE STIFLER -- very clean-cut and preppy, he's a
     maniac, a jackass, much worse than Oz.  Not really part
     of the group.

                         STIFLER
                   (yelling)
               NOVA!!

                         OZ
               Stifler!!

     Stifler runs full-force into Oz, grabbing him in a bear
     hug.

                         STIFLER
               You coming to party tonight,
               Ostreicher, ya fuckface?

                         OZ
               Depends if my date wants to stop by.

                         STIFLER
               That junior chick?

                         OZ
               Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm
               working on something new.

                         STIFLER
               Yeah right.  I got an idea for
               something new.  How 'bout you guys
               actually locate your dicks, remove the
               shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.

                         OZ
               Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a
               college chick!

                         STIFLER
               Bullshit.  From where?

                         OZ
               She works part-time at my dad's store.

                         STIFLER
               Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like
               your dad works at her store.

                         OZ
               Dude, he does not.

                         KEVIN
               Really, Stifler.  He's the manager.

     Oz gives a little nod, avoiding the issue.

                         STIFLER
               Hey, man, I'm not making fun.  I'm
               fuckin' impressed.  I mean, "Footlong
               or six-inch, white or wheat," that's
               some serious shit to master.

     Oz musters a little LAUGH.

                         KEVIN
                   (half-joking)
               Stifler, you're such an asshole.

                         STIFLER
               Meyers, what's the deal with you and
               Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out
               since Homecoming and all she'll do is
               blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a
               steaming turd.

                         FINCH
               Do you commonly grasp warm pieces of
               stool?

                         STIFLER
                   (momentarily puzzled)
               I do when I'm throwing them at your
               mom, you damn freak.
                   (then)
               Alright then, see you guys tonight.
               I'll look for you in the No Fucking
               section.

     The guys all take this little too seriously to have a
     comeback.  Stifler just LAUGHS OBNOXIOUSLY as he walks
     off.

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Kevin is on the phone.  Hanging near his closet is a
     tuxedo.  INTERCUT with KEVIN'S OLDER BROTHER -- 25, on
     his cell phone, traveling down a California road.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               You called me to ask me how to get laid?

                         KEVIN
               What was I gonna do, call dad?  I
               don't even know his number.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               Just dial 976-Asshole.

                         KEVIN
               Yeah, well anyway...I thought you
               might have some advice, brother to
               brother.  I mean, I think tonight she
               might, we might really, there's a
               chance that -- you know.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               Have you ever heard of the bible?

                         KEVIN
               What?  Not the Bible?

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               Well, that's not really the name, but
               we always called it that.

                         KEVIN
               Does it tell me how to get laid?

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               You know what, nevermind.  You're not
               ready.

                         KEVIN
               Ready for what?

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck
               at that party.

     INT. DOG DAYS - LATE AFTERNOON

     A small, nostalgia-themed dive.  Despite the theme,
     CLASSIC ROCK plays.  Kevin, Oz, Jim and Finch sit at a
     table.  They munch on hot dogs piled high with
     condiments.

                         KEVIN
               You ever hear of something called The
               Bible?

                         OZ
               Once, in church, dude.

     Jim is paging through Great Falls' equivalent of the LA
     Weekly.

                         JIM
               Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive
               SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind
               seeks outgoing companion."
               Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.

                         OZ
               "Fun loving" -- insane.

                         KEVIN
               Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind,"
               equals old.

                         JIM
               No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is
               really old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.

                         FINCH
               Perhaps you should consider actually
               answering an ad.

                         JIM
               Finch, you can be the one to date a
               nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your
               damn imitation hot dog.

                         FINCH
                   ("for the hundredth time")
               This is no imitation.  Removing the
               hot dog from the Ultradog yields a
               better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no
               dog.

     Finch displays the cross-section on his hot dog.  It's
     all condiments.  The guys react with rehearsed offense.

                         KEVIN
                   (checks his watch)
               Alright...I'm shooting for a nine
               o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five
               after.

                         JIM
               You can crash at Stifler's?

                         KEVIN
               It's all good.
                   (He pulls out some gum)
               Breath check.

     He hands out a stick of gum to each guy, automatically
     skipping Finch, who pulls out a small, hotel-bottle of
     Scope.  Gargles with it.  Spits it into his drink cup.

                         OZ
                   (repulsed)
               Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.

                         KEVIN
               You got something up your sleeve for
               tonight, Finch?

                         FINCH
               A foolproof plan, my friend.  You
               shall see.

     Oz has tuned into the song in the background -- "Blinded
     by the Light" [the original Springsteen version, not the
     Manfred Mann remake].

                         OZ
                   (sings along)
               And little hurly-burly came by in her
               curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed
               I ri-hide --

                         KEVIN
               How the hell do you know all these
               random songs?

                         OZ
               It's early Springsteen, dude, this is
               classic.  This was before the cheesy
               remake.

                         JIM
               This was remade?  Into what?

                         OZ
                   (chiming in as the chorus hits)
               Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose
               like a deuce, another runner in the
               night, blinded...

                         KEVIN
               At least now I know what the hell
               they're saying.

                         JIM
               So, does my hair look better --
                   (flips a small lock of hair
                    onto his forehead)
               like this, or...
                   (flips it back up)
               like this?

                         OZ
               Who cares?

                         JIM
               Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian
               chick, she might be there tonight.
               Now, do you think she'd prefer --
                   (flips hair down again)
               Cool Hip Jim...
                   (flips it back up)
               or Laid Back Jim?

                         KEVIN
               The difference is so phenomenal, I
               can't decide.

     EXT. DOG DAYS - MAGIC HOUR - CONTINUING

     They exit the restaurant.

                         JIM
               What about you?  You're the one with
               the girlfriend and you're still
               stranded on third base.

                         KEVIN
               You know, I've never got that shit.
               What exactly constitutes third base?

                         OZ
                   (holds up a couple fingers)
               Contact, dude.

                         KEVIN
               Then where does a blowjob figure in?

     They ponder this for a moment.

                         OZ
               Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it
               to third, and you're out.

                         JIM
               So let's say you get there...what's
               uh, third base feel like?

                         KEVIN
               Oh, man, that's kind of sad.

     Jim shrugs, embarrassed.

                         OZ
               Feels like warm apple pie, dude.

                         JIM
               Apple pie...
                   (then)
               McDonald's or homemade?

     They just look at him.  Finch hops on his scooter.

                         FINCH
               Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia.

     He MEEPS his horn and buzzes away.

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     For a high-school party, it's pretty good.  The house is
     peppered with ALL TYPES OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS.  MUSIC
     blends with the din of excited conversation.

     Kevin and Jim are drinking beers.  Around them, students
     mingle and flirt.  CHUCK SHERMAN comes up.

                         SHERMAN
               What's up, fellas?

                         JIM
               Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.

                         SHERMAN
               Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys.
               Confidence is high, repeat, confidence
               is high.
               Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full
               strategic arsenal ready for
               deployment.

                         JIM
               You've got something going?

                         SHERMAN
               Did you see that Central chick?
               Brunette?

                         KEVIN/JIM
               No.

                         SHERMAN
               She's around.  Seems that she's taken
               a liking to me.  Fellas, it's time
               that she experienced -- The
               Sherminator.

                         KEVIN
               Yeah, okay Sherman, whatever.

                         SHERMAN
               I'm a sophisticated sex robot, sent
               back through time...to change the
               future for one lucky lady.

                         KEVIN
               Yeah man, right on!

     Sherman saunters off into the party.

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
                   (shakes his head)
               Hopeless.

     Vicky approaches, having a good time, joining the guys,
     EXCHANGING GREETINGS.  Jim spots NADIA across the room.
     She's beautiful, a masterpiece of a woman.

                         JIM
               Oh, shit!  There she is.  Nadia.

                         VICKY
               You like her?  Her sponsor family
               lives on my block.  Why don't you talk
               to her?

                         JIM
               What would I say?

                         VICKY
               Just tell her what's on your mind.
               And smile, you've got a good smile.
                   (then to Kevin)
               Come on.

                         KEVIN
                   (to Jim)
               Gotta go.

                         JIM
               But --

     Kevin and Vicky disappear into the crowd -- just as Jim
     sees Nadia approaching him.  He freaks.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Kevin, get back here!

     But he's gone.  And Nadia is now in front of him.  With
     no other alternative, Jim readies himself, smiling big.

                         NADIA
                   (with a really sexy accent)
               You are in my English class, no?

     Jim smiles.

                         JIM
                   (barely)
               Yes.

                         NADIA
               I thought so.

     Jim's smile grows even bigger, almost stupid.  A beat.

                         NADIA (cont'd)
               So you are having fun?

     Jim nods, still smiling away.  Staring right through her
     head.

                         NADIA (cont'd)
               I said, you are having fun?

     A little SQUEAK escapes his throat.  Jim is on mental
     vacation.

                         NADIA (cont'd)
               Me too.

     A beat.  Jim's expression is now plasticized.  Eyes
     vacant.  A frozen, completely artificial smile. Nadia is
     confused.

                         NADIA (cont'd)
               Well...I am going to get another beer.
               You want one?

     Jim strains to speak, through his smile.

                         JIM
               No...you...go...ahead.

                         NADIA
               Okay.

     She walks off.  Jim SIGHS, completely relaxing, like a
     huge burden is now off of him.  He wipes his brow.  Then,
     realizing --

                         JIM
               Oh, shit.  No!  Shit!

     He pounds his head with his fist.

     EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

     A group of band dorks is on the porch, including
     Michelle.  Stifler stands in the doorway, staring at them
     in disbelief.

                         MICHELLE
               We're here for the party?

                         STIFLER
               What party?  There's no party.

     MUSIC blares from inside.  A drunken HAND reaches through
     the door and ruffles Stifler's hair.

                         PARTY GUY (O.S.)
               Stiff-lerrr!  Par-tyyy!!

     The hand disappears back into the house.  A beat.

                         STIFLER
               Try the house down the street.

     Stifler slams the door.  The dorks wait a moment.

                         BAND DORK
               Ring the bell again.

                         MICHELLE
               Ringing the bell is dorky -- let's
               just go in.

     We hear a CLICK OF A DEADBOLT.

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Kevin and Vicky are on the bed, making out.

                         VICKY
               Oh, Kev.

                         KEVIN
               Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's
               time for us to take the next step in
               our relationship?

                         VICKY
               Tonight?

                         KEVIN
               Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.
               Isn't this how you've always pictured
               it?

                         PARTY GUY (O.S.)
                   (yelling)
               Dude, my farts fuckin' stink!

                         PARTY GUY #2 (O.S.)
               You reek like a fuckin' Yeti, dude!
               Go take a shit or something!

     Kevin and Vicky exchange a glance.

                         KEVIN
               Or not.

     Vicky pushes him onto his back.

                         VICKY
               Just relax.

     INT. CAR - NIGHT

     Oz is in the passenger seat, making out with the
     aforementioned COLLEGE CHICK.  She's attractive and older-
     looking (from a high-school perspective).  They are
     parked near the river that flows through downtown Great
     Falls.

                         OZ
               Great evening, isn't it?

                         COLLEGE CHICK
               Sure.

                         OZ
               There's something about the spring
               that's just cool.  Like the smell of
               fresh rain or something.

     At this, she snuggles up to him.  Oz smiles confidently.

                         OZ (CONT'D)
               Suck me, beautiful.

     The College Chick backs off, confounded.

                         COLLEGE CHICK
               What did you just say?

                         OZ
                   (not so confidently)
               Suck me...beautiful?

     The College Chick's eyes flutter in disbelief.  She tries
     to keep her cool -- but can barely restrain her laughter.

                         COLLEGE CHICK
               What?!

     Oz attempts to maintain a suave exterior, but he's just
     had the rug pulled from under him.

                         OZ
               Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova
               -- as in Casanova.

                         COLLEGE CHICK
               You need some work, buddy!

     She bursts into laughter.  Oz is ill.

                         OZ
               Well...jeez, don't laugh at me.

     Seeing Oz's defeated expression, she collects herself.

                         COLLEGE CHICK
               Look, Chris.  There are just some
               things you need to learn, that's all.

                         OZ
               Like what?

     She sees that he's lost.  Almost feels sorry for him.

                         COLLEGE CHICK
               Alright, well...you've got to tone it
               down.  You don't need to go to Lookout
               Point and spout cheeseball lines to be
               romantic.

                         OZ
               ...okay...

                         COLLEGE CHICK
               You have to pay attention to a girl.
               Be sensitive to her feelings.
               Relationships are reciprocal.

                         OZ
               I'm not good in math.

     She's trying not to laugh again.

                         COLLEGE CHICK
               Come on, I'll drop you off at your
               friends'.

     Oz couldn't be humiliated any further.

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - SAME TIME

     Oz is nursing a beer, having just told the story to Jim,
     Stifler, and some guys.

                         STIFLER
                   (hysterical, toppling over)
               You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!

                         OZ
               Shut the fuck up.

                         JIM
               Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.

                         OZ
               Oh that's really reassuring.  And
               don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a
               fraud.

                         STIFLER
               This is pathetic.  I'm gonna find me a
               little hottie.

     Stifler strides into another room.

                         STIFLER (O.S.)(cont'd)
                   (yelling)
               Suck me, beautiful!

     Oz wallows in his beer can, beaten.

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Vicky is pleasuring Kevin...you know.

                         VICKY
                   (brief pause)
               Let me know.

                         KEVIN
               Okay, don't stop.

     She resumes.  A moment more -- and then Kevin is about to
     lose it.

                         KEVIN (cont'd)
               Oh -- Now!

     With awkward hurriedness, Vicky stops as Kevin
     frantically searches for a receptacle.  He grabs a nearby
     cup of beer.

     EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH, BY THE KEG - NIGHT

     Insert -- A hand pumping up the keg.  A fresh beer foams
     out into the cup.

                         GUY #1
               There we go.

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

     Vicky is buttoning up her shirt.  Kevin tentatively sets
     down the beer and buttons his pants.  Suddenly the DOOR
     BURSTS OPEN.  Stifler is standing there.  A coat hanger
     sticks out of the doorknob.

                         STIFLER
               SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!

                         KEVIN
               God dammit, Stifler!

                         STIFLER
               Check-out time!  Please vacate the
               room.

                         VICKY
               Stifler, you're such a jerk.

     She runs out, grabbing her clothes.  Kevin runs after
     her.

                         KEVIN
               Vicky, wait!

     Stifler enters the bedroom, laughing, pulling a SOPHOMORE
     CHICK behind him.  He closes the door.

                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
               God, I can't believe there are so many
               cool people at this party.

                         STIFLER
               Yep.

                         SOPHOMORE
               And you got a keg, too, wow.
                   (realizing)
               Oh, wait, I left my beer downstairs.

     Stifler notices Kevin's beer sitting on the night table.
     He hands it to her.

                         STIFLER
               Here, babe.

                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
               Thanks.

     She's about to take a sip.

                         STIFLER
                   (gazing into her eyes)
               You're really beautiful.

     Thrown off, she sets the beer down.

                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
               Really?

                         STIFLER
               Uh huh.

     She's totally enthralled.  Nervous, she raises the beer
     again to take a sip.  Then Stifler moves in.  Takes the
     beer from her and sets it down.  Starts kissing her.  She
     breaks it off.

                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
               I don't know if I want to be doing
               this.

                         STIFLER
                   (sighs)
               Doing what?

     Stifler looks inconvenienced.  He picks up the beer,
     annoyed.

                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
               You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow
               I'll just be some girl you go telling
               all your friends about.

                         STIFLER
                   (shifty)
               No way.

     Avoiding her look, he raises the beer to take a sip.

                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
                   (a little angry)
               Steve!  You could at least look at me
               when you say that.

     Stifler stops and SIGHS, the beer inches from his mouth.
     Lowers it.  Stares her in the eye.

                         STIFLER
               Look...
                   (searching, remembers)
               ...Sarah.  I wouldn't go telling
               stories or whatever about you.  I
               promise.

     Smiling, he raises the beer...

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUING

     Jim and some OTHER GUYS are pounding shots of vodka.

                         JIM
               What the hell?  I should be able to
               talk to chicks.  I'm articulate.  I
               got a 720 on my SAT verbal.
                   (starts listing off words)
               Copious.  Verisimilitude.

     A GUY SCREAMS upstairs.

                         JIM (CONT'D)
                   (unaffected)
               Intransigence.

     A GIRL SCREAMS upstairs.  The SOPHOMORE CHICK comes
     running through the kitchen.  SCREAMING.  And
     indeterminate stain is on her shirt.  She bolts out the
     door and into the night.  A moment passes.

                         JIM (CONT'D)
               Regurgitation.

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Stifler is on his knees, barfing in the toilet.  Jim and
     a few other guys rush in.

                         GUY #1
               Oh, gross.

                         JIM
               Jesus, what did you eat?

     Stifler just keeps hurling.  Kevin enters, holding the
     remains of the tainted beer.

                         KEVIN
               Stifler, how's the man chowder?!

     Stifler barfs even more violently.

     EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH, BY THE KEG - NIGHT

     Jessica and Vicky are refilling their beers at the keg.
     Nadia waits patiently beside them with an empty cup.

                         VICKY
               He likes it.

                         JESSICA
               Of course he does.  What about you?
               Have you just never had one with Kevin
               -- or have you never had one, period?

                         VICKY
               I think I've had one.

                         JESSICA
               Well that's a no.  No wonder you're
               not psyched about sex.
                   (starts filling Vicky's beer)
               You've never even had one manually?

                         VICKY
               ...I've never tried it.

                         JESSICA
               Are you kidding?  You've never double-
               clicked your mouse?

     Vicky shrugs.

                         JESSICA (CONT'D)
               Hell, just a pair of tight pants will
               set me off.
                   (noticing Nadia next to them,
                    she passes the tap along)
               Am I right or what, Nadia?

                         NADIA
                   (no bones about it)
               You are right.  The hands are not
               always necessary.

                         JESSICA
                   (to Vicky)
               See?

                         NADIA
               In fact -- I should teach you my own
               special method.  I developed it myself
               at the ballet institute in Prague.
               You use nothing but the muscles of the
               inner thigh.

     Nadia walks off.

                         JESSICA
               No wonder she never pays attention in
               class.

     Vicky nods, traumatized.

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

     Kevin and Jim are looking at a PICTURE OF STIFLER'S MOM
     on the wall.  Very attractive, late 30's.

                         JIM
               Shit, I can't believe a fine woman
               like this produced a guy like Stifler.

     TWO FRESHMAN GUYS are walking by as Jim says this.

                         FRESHMAN GUY
               Dude!  That chick -- is a MILF!

                         FRESHMAN GUY #2
               What the hell is that?

                         FRESHMAN GUY
               M-I-L-F!  Mom I'd Like to Fuck!

     Suddenly, a bedroom door opens a couple inches.  Sherman
     pokes his head out.

                         SHERMAN
                   (hushed, to guys)
               Don't you think you fellas could try a
               little tact?  I've got company.  Know
               what I mean?

     In the bedroom in the background, we see the Central
     Girl.  Sherman closes the door, leaving the guys there,
     dumbstruck.

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     Jim and Kevin are coming down the stairs.

                         KEVIN
                   (snapping)
               Dammit!  If Sherman has sex before I
               do, I'm gonna be really fucking
               pissed.

     They turn the corner into the kitchen.

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUING

                         KEVIN
               Man, I just gotta get laid already!
               This blowjob thing is bullshit!

     He stops.  Vicky is there with Jessica.  Staring at him.
     Vicky quietly grabs her purse.  Hurt.  OTHER STUDENTS
     watch, silently.  Kevin doesn't know what to say.

                         VICKY
               Jessica, can you drive me home?

                         JESSICA
               Sure.

     The guys watch as the girls head for the door.

                         KEVIN
               Vicky, wait.

                         VICKY
               Not for you.

     The girls exit.  Nobody says anything.  Kevin is in
     shock.

                         PARTY GUY (O.S.)
               Yeti!  I am the Yeti!

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - DAY

     The next morning.  The party is long over.  Plastic beer
     cups and various bottles litter the house, but it's not
     trashed.

     Jim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head.  He
     stumbles over a body.  It's Kevin.

                         KEVIN
               Ow, what the hell?

                         JIM
               Sorry, I thought you were dead.

     They walk over to the other side of the room.  Finch is
     sitting on the couch.

                         FINCH
               Good morning gentleman.

                         JIM
               Finch!  Where were you last night?
               What happened to the foolproof plan?

                         FINCH
               I thought a fashionably late entrance
               would enhance my appearance.
                   (off their looks)
               When I got here, the Bacchanalia was
               over and the nymphs had left.

     Oz wanders in, still sullen.  Takes a seat, sulking.

                         KEVIN
               Feeling better, Oz?

                         OZ
               I'm such a loser.

                         KEVIN
               That's the spirit.

     We hear FOOTSTEPS coming down the stairs.  It's the
     CENTRAL GIRL.  She wears a "Central" sweatshirt.  Sherman
     follows behind her.  The guys watch in disbelief as
     Sherman and the girl speak hushed, intimately.

                         SHERMAN
                   (snippets of conversation)
               ...I'll never forget...thank you.

     The Central Girl smiles.  Notices the other guys
     watching.  Just gives Sherman a kiss on the cheek.

                         CENTRAL GIRL
               Bye.

     She exits.  The guys are dumbfounded.  Jaws hang.
     Sherman looks triumphant.  Strides over to the guys.

                         JIM
               You did it.

                         SHERMAN
               Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman,
               the boy.  I am now a man.

     The guys are shocked and amazed.

                         SHERMAN (CONT'D)
               I highly recommend you join the club.

                         KEVIN
               I -- I don't get it, how the hell did
               you do that?

                         SHERMAN
               It was just my time, fellas, it was
               just my time.  Best of luck to you,
               boys.

     Sherman exits.  Silence.  The guys look like they just
     lost the World Series on errors.  They slowly take seats,
     ruined.

                         KEVIN
               I put in months of quality time with
               Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one
               night and scores?  This is just wrong.

                         OZ
               No shit, I'm never gonna get laid.
               How the hell am I gonna become this
               Mr. Sensitive Man?

                         JIM
               Jesus, we're all gonna go to college
               as virgins.  They've probably got
               special dorms for people like us.

     A long beat as they give this serious consideration.
     Then, Kevin strides purposefully to the front of the
     group.

                         KEVIN
               Alright, I got an idea.  But it stays
               between us.  Agreed?

     They do.

                         KEVIN (cont'd)
               Okay.  It's really simple.  We
               make an agreement -- no wait, more
               than an agreement.

                         JIM
               Like a bet?

                         KEVIN
               No, a pact.  No money involved.  This
               is more important than any bet.  Now
               here's the deal: We all get laid
               before we graduate.

     A beat

                         OZ
               Dude, it's not like I haven't been
               trying to get laid.

                         KEVIN
               This is different.  This is better.
               Think of when you're working out, Oz.
               You need a partner, someone to spot
               you.  Someone to keep you motivated.

     Oz nods, getting into it.  Kevin smiles and continues,
     arms outspread.

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
               That's what we are, we keep each other
               on track.  Prior to this day, we've
               postured.  We've procrastinated.
               We've pretended.  We've -- well I
               can't think of other p-words, but
               we've probably done them too.

                         JIM
               Pontificated.

                         KEVIN
                   (ignoring him)
               Separately, we are flawed and
               vulnerable.  But together, we are the
               masters of our sexual destiny!

                         JIM
                   (kung fu voice)
               Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong;
               but our dragon style will defeat it!

                         OZ
                   (going on)
               The Sha-lin masters from east and west
               must unite!

                         KEVIN
               Guys, guys -- you're ruining my
               fucking moment here.  Now think about
               it --

     Kevin jumps up on a chair.

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
               No longer will our penises remain
               flaccid and unused!  From now on, we
               fight for every man out there who
               isn't getting laid when he should be!
               This is our day!  This is our time!
               And, by God, we're not gonna let
               history condemn us to celibacy!  We
               will make a stand!  We will succeed!
               We will get laid!

     Kevin jumps down off the chair, and puts his hand out in
     front of him.  One by one, the guys pile their hands on
     top, in between them -- it's a pact!  They break with a
     CHEER.  Woo-hoo!

                         STIFLER
                   (wandering down from upstairs)
               What the hell are you losers doing?

     They all stop.  Stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his
     mouth.  A goatee of dried toothpaste.

                         FINCH
               If I might ask, when you brush your
               teeth, do you spit or swallow?

     Stifler tries to give a retort to Finch, but turns green
     and heads back upstairs.

     INT. DOG DAYS - DAY

     The guys are finishing up breakfast.  Hot dogs & eggs.

                         KEVIN
               Now, the sex -- it's got to be valid,
               consensual sex.  No funny stuff.  And
               no prostitutes, if you were thinking
               about that, Finch.

     Finch gives a wistful "Who, me?"

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
               So, I'm thinking prom is basically our
               last big chance.

                         OZ
               Dude, prom sucks.

                         KEVIN
               I know, but think about it -- At the
               parties that night.  Chicks are gonna
               want to do it.

                         JIM
               Yeah, it's like tradition or
               something.

                         KEVIN
               Right.  That gives us...

                         JIM
               Exactly three weeks to the day.

     They take this in with some trepidation.

                         KEVIN
               Alright then.  It's official.  Any
               questions?

     There are none.  Kevin raises his Pepsi.

                         KEVIN (cont'd)
               To the next step.

     The guys raise their drinks.

                         ALL
               To the next step.

     They toast.  And from this, we go into our STRATEGIZING
     FOR SEX MONTAGE:

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Jim sits in the room as Kevin goes through the yellow
     pages.  Finds a "Floral Delivery" listing.  Kevin dials.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

     Kevin, Jim, and Oz are pooling a few dollars together,
     which Kevin takes.  They part ways.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Oz is watching the Lifetime Channel as Jim looks on in
     confusion.  A Martha Stewart-type thing where they pain
     pottery with little sponges.  Oz looks dubious.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

     Finch is unpacking his lunch.  He carefully unfolds a
     napkin to reveal a sandwich, crust removed.  Other than
     that, he's doing absolutely nothing.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Jim is fiddling with a small, golfball-like camera
     attached to his computer.  The computer screen reads, "E-
     DATE:  We Make Love Happen."  As Jim fiddles with the
     camera, a window on the screen shows his real-time image.
     He clicks an onscreen-button labeled "FREEZE IMAGE" --
     the image freezes, showing Jim with an awkward grimace.
     The screen reads, "IMAGE SENT."

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGHS - LIBRARY - DAY

     Kevin holds a copy of the HOLY BIBLE.  We see he's in the
     "Religion" section.  Surrounded by piles of different
     bibles.  No luck.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

     Finch pulls out a small mustard packet.  He neatly snips
     the end with scissors.  Then rolls the packet, like a
     tube of toothpaste, economically dispensing every last
     bit of mustard.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jim is on his computer.  The screen reads "YOU HAVE 00
     REPLIES."  Jim is nonplussed.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

     Kevin, Oz, and Jim are closely gathered around Kevin's
     locker, holding their backpacks open.  Kevin holds a big
     shopping bag, which he turns over, and a box of condoms
     falls out.  He hands it over to Jim...and we see that the
     guys' packs are full of various condom boxes.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Jim has unraveled a bunch of condoms and is curiously
     examining them.

     And THE MONTAGE COMES TO AN ABRUPT END with a KNOCKING.

                         JIM
                   (shoving the rubbers into his
                    night table)
               Just a minute!

     He opens the bedroom door.  Jim's Dad is standing there.

                         JIM'S DAD
                   (trying not to look inside)
               Can I come in?

                         JIM
               Yeah, sure.

                         JIM'S DAD
               You're not...busy?

                         JIM
               Dad, come in.

     Jim's Dad reluctantly enters, carrying a brown paper bag.
     He takes a seat on Jim's bed.

                         JIM'S DAD
                   (fatherly attempt)
               Sit down, Jim.  Let's talk.

     Jim takes a seat next to his dad.

                         JIM
               Okay.

                         JIM'S DAD
               These are for you.  From father to
               son.

     Jim looks at the bag.  Uncomfortable.  Hesitantly, he
     takes it.  Slowly, dreadfully, he pulls out a copy of
     PERFECT 10.

                         JIM
               Uh...dad...

     Jim's Dad is doing his best to be the good father.

                         JIM'S DAD
               Go ahead son, there's more.

     Beyond embarrassed, Jim reaches into the bag.  Cringes.
     Pulls out a PENTHOUSE.

                         JIM'S DAD (cont'd)
               Now, that one's a little more...a
               little more...graphic.

                         JIM
               I know, Dad.

                         JIM'S DAD
               Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.

     Jim's Dad takes the bag back.  Pulls out a copy of
     SHAVED.

                         JIM'S DAD (cont'd)
               This, son, is your more exotic dirty
               magazine.

                         JIM
               Dad!  I know!

                         JIM'S DAD
               Do you know about the clitoris?

                         JIM
                   (through clenched teeth)
               Yes dad.

                         JIM'S DAD
               Sometimes it can be pretty hard to
               locate.

                         JIM
                   (interrupting, hand up)
               Thank you, dad, I got it.

                         JIM'S DAD
               Okay, well that about covers it.

     Jim MURMURS something incomprehensible.

                         JIM'S DAD (cont'd)
               Now, let's put these somewhere where
               your mother won't find them.

     Jim's Dad takes the stack of magazines.  He goes to open
     Jim's night table.  Jim freaks.

                         JIM
               Wait!

     But it's too late.  Jim's Dad is face-to-face with the
     unraveled prophylactics.  He sours.

                         JIM'S DAD
                   (beaten)
               I'll have to save this speech for
               another day.  I'm too worn out.

     Jim's Dad exits, a condom stuck to the back of his pants.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NEAR THE HALL OF FAME - DAY

     Kevin is trying to talk to Vicky.

                         KEVIN
               Did you get the flowers?
                   (no response)
               What about the poem?

     She doesn't care.

                         KEVIN (cont'd)
               Vicky, please don't do this.

     Vicky stares him right in the eye.  Strong.

                         VICKY
               I'll think about it.

     She slams her locker and walks off.  Jessica is nearby.
     She's overheard.

                         JESSICA
               Ah, you'll get her back soon enough.
               That's easy, she likes you.  What you
               need to do is learn to press a girl's
               buttons.  You gotta give her what
               she's never had.

                         KEVIN
               What?

                         JESSICA
               I'll give you a hint.
                   (hot, orgasmic)
               "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"
                   (flat)
               Comprende?

                         KEVIN
               You mean...and orgasm?

                         JESSICA
               You got it, stud.

                         KEVIN
               Well...I'm pretty sure I've --

                         JESSICA
                   (interrupts authoritatively)
               No you haven't.

                         KEVIN
               But that one time --

                         JESSICA
                   (shaking head)
               No.

                         KEVIN
               Well of course I'd want to give her
               that.  I mean, what do you think, I
               don't care about her?

                         JESSICA
               Do you?

                         KEVIN
               Of course.

                         JESSICA
               Do you love her?

     Kevin squirms.

                         KEVIN
               I -- I don't know, you can't ask me
               that.

                         JESSICA
               Well, if you want to get her in the
               sack, tell her you love her.  That's
               how I was duped.

                         KEVIN
               I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If
               I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.

                         JESSICA
               Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or
               the Big O.

     Suddenly Stifler comes running up, breathless.

                         STIFLER
               Dickhead!  You gotta see this.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER

     The VOCAL JAZZ GROUP is practicing, singing one of those
     doo-wop, Acapella love songs (i.e. "Love You Like I Do").
     Singing with the group is none other than Oz.  He's not
     doing too badly, but mainly he's checking out the various
     vocal jazz girls.  Smiling at them, giving suave little
     waves.

     Kevin, Stifler, and Jim take seats in the back of the
     auditorium, listening.

                         JIM
               This is unexpected.

                         STIFLER
               What did you cocks do to him?  Shit,
               if Coach Marshall sees this, he'll
               kick Oz off the team on principle
               alone.

     The song finishes.  Oz bounds up to the other guys.

                         OZ
               Hey guys, you came to watch me in
               action?

                         JIM
               Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.

                         STIFLER
               I think you need your balls
               reattached.

                         OZ
               Keep it down, dude.

                         STIFLER
               What the fuck are you doing here?

                         OZ
               This place is an untapped resource.
               Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz
               girls are hot.

     ANGLE ON SOME VOCAL JAZZ GIRLS

     A few of the girls are gathering their stuff, one of whom
     is HEATHER -- conservative-looking, cute.

                         VOCAL JAZZ GIRL #1
               Hey, we've got Conan the Barbarian
               singing with us.

                         VOCAL JAZZ GIRL #2
               Maybe he'll crush some beer cans on
               his forehead.

                         HEATHER
               I think he's got a nice voice.

                         VOCAL JAZZ GIRL #1
                   (ribbing her)
               Go talk to him, maybe you can teach
               him how to read.

     Heather shakes her head.  BACK TO:

                         STIFLER
               You dipshit, you're expecting to score
               with some goody-goody choir-girl
               priss?

                         OZ
               Dude, watch me work.  They go for
               sensitive studs like me.

     Oz waves goodbye to a final choir girl.

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - LATER

     Finch is sitting on a bench, reading the paper, carefree.
     Kevin and Jim approach.

                         KEVIN
               This is your plan, Finch?

                         FINCH
               Yep.

     He turns a page.  Skims the articles.  A beat.

                         KEVIN
               This.  Right now.

                         FINCH
               Uh-huh.

                         JIM
               You're just gonna sit there and drink
               your coffee?

                         FINCH
               Mochaccino.
                   (then)
               Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I
               do need to ask for your cooperation in
               one small matter.

                         KEVIN
               Of course, Finch.  What?

                         FINCH
               Whatever you hear about me, you agree.

                         KEVIN
               What are we gonna hear?

                         FINCH
               You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen
               minute round trip.

                         JIM
               Finch, don't you think it's about time
               you learned to take a dump at school?

                         FINCH
               When was the last time you looked at
               the facilities here?

                         KEVIN
               Fifteen minutes ago.

     Finch shudders and walks away.  Kevin and Jim stand
     there, dumbfounded.  An ENTHRALLED GIRL approaches.

                         ENTHRALLED GIRL
               Uh, guys?  Was that Paul Finch?

                         KEVIN
               Yeah.

                         ENTHRALLED GIRL
               You guys have like, seen him in the
               locker room, right?

                         KEVIN
               Yeah.

                         ENTHRALLED GIRL
               Is it true that he's really...huge?

                         JIM
               I have no idea.  Finch showers in a
               bathing suit.

                         KEVIN
                   (forced)
               No -- it's true.  He is...really...
               big.

                         JIM
                   (loving it)
               Yeah, enormous.

                         ENTHRALLED GIRL
               Woah.  Does he have a date for prom
               yet.

                         JIM
               Definitely not.

                         ENTHRALLED GIRL
               No way!

     She hurries off to a GROUP OF GIRLS, sharing the gossip.
     They all seem very interested.

                         KEVIN
                   (dumbfounded)
               Finch hasn't done a damn thing, and
               he's got girls lining up already.

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Kevin is on the phone.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)
               Say that again, Kevin?

                         KEVIN
               Uh...I thought you might know a trick
               or something.  To make her, you
               know...

     INTERCUT WITH

     INT. SUSHI BAR - DAY

     Kevin's brother is on his cell phone.  A SUSHI CHEF
     prepares food behind the counter.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               Orgasm?

     The Sushi Chef looks up.  Kevin's Brother turns away.

                         KEVIN
               Yeah.

                         SUSHI CUSTOMER
                   (to Kevin's Brother)
               What's good here?

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               Try the spicy tuna hand roll.

                         KEVIN
               What?!  How do I do that?

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all
               you're interested in?  Ways to get
               your girlfriend into bed?

                         KEVIN
               Well, no.  I think...I guess it would
               be good to be able to return the
               favor.  I mean, it would be nice to
               know she enjoys things as much as I
               do.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               That's good, that's what I needed to
               hear.  Now you qualify.

                         KEVIN
               Qualify for what?

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER
               You've just inherited The Bible.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BACK OF LIBRARY - DAY

     Kevin is walking through the "Religion" Section.  He
     carefully looks about, making sure nobody's watching.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)
               It originally started as a sex manual,
               this book that some guys brought back
               from Amsterdam in the early eighties.
               What to do with your tongue, things
               like that.  And each year, it got
               passed on to one East student who was
               worthy of it.

     Kevin kneels down on the floor, near a section of various
     bibles on the bottom shelf.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd)
               After a couple years, guys started
               adding their own techniques.  Things
               they figured out themselves.

     Kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom
     shelf.  Pulls out a pocket knife.  Flips up the bottom of
     the shelf.  Slides it out.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd)
               You have to keep it a secret, and
               return it at the end of the year.  So,
               now you know.  Good luck.

     There, a bit dusty, is an old book.  Many extra pages of
     notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking
     the binding.  The original title is now obscured -- over
     it, someone has written "The Bible."

     Remember when Indian Jones found that gold statue?  It's
     like that right now.

     Kevin carefully pulls it out.  Reverently flips through
     it.  Full of details.  Explicit diagrams.  Anecdotes.
     And atop each handwritten page is a year, indicating the
     date it was added.

     Kevin reaches the last page.  It's blank.  He lightly
     runs his hand down the empty page.

     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

     Jim enters his house, slinging his backpack off his
     shoulder.

                         JIM
                   (yells)
               Mom?!  I'm home!

     No response.  Jim walks into the kitchen, noticing a
     fresh-baked pie on the counter.  Next to it is a note:
     "Jimmy - Apple, your favorite.  I'll be home late.
     Enjoy!  Love Mom."

     Jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma.  Then stops...as
     a quizzical look spreads across his face.

     After a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the
     pie.  Moves it around a bit, studying the consistency.

     Then Jim becomes more curious.  We can see the gears in
     his head start to turn.  He looks down at the pie like
     it's... well, not a pie.

     EXT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY

     Jim's dad gets out of his car, carrying his briefcase.

     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - CONTINUING

     Jim's dad comes in the door and stops dead in his tracks.
     His face drops, appalled.

                         JIM'S DAD
               Jim?

                         JIM
               It's not what it looks like!

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

     Jim and his Dad sit in silence, opposite each other at
     the table.  Jim stares into his lap, humiliated.  Jim's
     dad is crushed.  You've never seen such disappointment...
     but he's trying to keep his chin up for Jim's sake.

     In the middle of the table is the pie.  It's decimated.
     Mushed up, ruined...violated.

                         JIM'S DAD
                   (fighting back tears)
               I guess...we'll just tell your
               mother...that we ate it all.

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Late.  Kevin sits on his bed, reading a book -- the
     Bible.

     If all students studied the way Kevin's studying this
     book, we'd have a nation of geniuses.  He's scrutinizing
     it.  Turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to
     decipher cave paintings.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - DAY

     The Vocal Jazz Group is doing a song.  Oz is singing
     along, really making it look like he's into it.  He
     closes his eyes, singing with even more enthusiasm.  As
     the song ends, Oz continues just a moment more with his
     shtick -- a little, heartfelt vocal "scat" to tag the
     number.  The thing is, it actually sounds really good.

     Oz opens his eyes...to see the whole group -- especially
     the girls -- looking at him, somewhat awed.

     The CHOIR TEACHER is a smartly-dressed black woman.

                         CHOIR TEACHER
               What the hell was that?

                         OZ
               Sorry.

                         CHOIR TEACHER
               No, it was good.

                         OZ
               Oh, well...
                   (noticing Heather looking at
                    him, he acts "sensitive")
               It came from the heart.

                         CHOIR TEACHER
               Well then keep it coming.
                   (to everyone)
               Alright, people, good work!  Keep it
               up and we'll do great at the state
               competition.

     Rehearsal wraps up, and Heather comes up to Oz.

                         HEATHER
               Not bad, Chris.

                         OZ
                   (surprised himself)
               Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather,
               right?

                         HEATHER
               Yeah...so...you've got this sort of...
               Bobby McFerrin thing going there.

                         OZ
                   (no idea)
               Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.
                   (then, back into it)
               I feel like I've discovered this whole
               new side of me.  Music is so
               expressive.

                         HEATHER
                   (amused)
               Okay.
                   (then)
               I mean, I agree, but...aren't you
               supposed to be out, like, trying to
               decapitate someone with your lacrosse
               stick or something?

     Oz "gets serious" at this.

                         OZ
               Oh sure.  I know what people think.
               It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass
               lacrosse player -- I also play
               football, by the way -- But that's
               like...not all that I am.

                         HEATHER
               Of course, I didn't --

                         OZ
                   (cutting her off)
               I mean it really bothers me when
               people try to pigeonhole me like that.

                         HEATHER
                   (sparking to this)
               You?  You think I don't get that?
               God, it's like just because I don't
               get drunk and barf every weekend,
               people say "Oh, here's this goody-two-
               shoes choir-girl priss."

     Of course, this is what Stifler said about her.  And for
     a moment, this catches Oz off guard.

                         OZ
               Yeah...so like, what else do you do?

                         HEATHER
                   (offended)
               Well the same things you do.  Hang out
               with friends and stuff, you know,
               whatever.
                   (then)
               What do you think I do?

                         OZ
                   (genuine)
               I just -- realized that I didn't know
               anything about you.  I was interested.

                         HEATHER
               Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - DAY

     Kevin is walking home with Vicky.  He's a couple paces
     behind her, almost tagging along.

                         KEVIN
               I was being selfish.  And majorly
               insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.

                         VICKY
               I think "shithead" really says it.

                         KEVIN
               Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete
               and total shithead!

     She cracks a little smile.

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
               And I want to try to make it up to
               you.

                         VICKY
               How?

     Vicky stops walking.  Looks at Kevin.

     EXT. VICKY'S HOUSE - DAY

     Vicky's perfect suburban home...as we hear VICKY MOANING
     IN ECSTASY.

                         VICKY (V.O.)
               Oh...ungghhhhh!

                         KEVIN (V.O.)
               Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.

     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Tight on Vicky's face, in sexual bliss, writhing.

                         VICKY
               Oh Kevin -- don't stop!

                         KEVIN
               Just a second!

     We see that Kevin is kneeling on the floor.  Vicky's legs
     are to both sides of him -- he's ducking down, consulting
     the bible, which is hidden beneath the bed.  It's open to
     a page titled "The Tongue Tornado."

     Kevin resumes, out of frame.  Vicky goes nuts.

                         VICKY (cont'd)
                   (a little too loudly)
               Oh, God!

     Vicky reaches blindly for a pillow.  She squeezes it over
     her face, moaning into it.

                         VICKY (cont'd)
               Moly shmmmt!  Fmmkkkk!

     Noticing that Vicky now can't see him, Kevin cautiously
     pulls out The Bible from under the bed.  Sets it next to
     her.  He constantly refers from the book to Vicky, and
     back again.

     INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

     VICKY'S MOM is straining some pasta.  On the fridge, we
     see a collage in tribute to Vicky -- her senior portrait,
     National Honor Society certificate, a report card.

                         VICKY'S MOM
                   (yells to Vicky's Dad)
               Hon?  Can you tell Vick to come on
               down for supper?

     VICKY'S DAD is at the table reading the paper.  He gets
     up with a GRUNT.

     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Vicky can barely control herself.  She SCREAMS into the
     pillow.

                         KEVIN
               Vicky, shhh, you know there's no lock
               on your door.

     INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - STAIRWELL - DAY

     Vicky's dad is trudging up the stairs.

     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Vicky wrestles with her own ecstacy.  Groans.  Kevin
     keeps referencing The Bible.  Whatever he's doing, it's
     working.

     INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

     Vicky's dad approaches the bedroom door.

     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Vicky is about to explode.  She pulls the pillow off her
     face, gasping.

     INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

     Vicky's dad reaches for the doorknob.

                         VICKY (O.S.)
               I'M COMING!

     Vicky's dad shrugs, turns around, and heads back
     downstairs.

     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Jim's door opens...he winces...REVERSE to see Jim's dad
     looking at the family portrait of Jim's family in the
     hallway outside Jim's room, his back turned to Jim's
     door.

                         JIM
               Hey, dad.  Did you knock?

     Jim's dad continues to study the picture.  A beat.  Then
     he turns around, like he just realized the door was open.

                         JIM'S DAD
               Oh, Jim!  I'm looking at the ol'
               family portrait, here.  Yep.  It's a
               good one.

     Jim can only shrugs in response.  He goes into the hall
     and looks at the portrait.  A beat.

                         JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)
               Son, I wanted to talk to you about
               what I think you were trying to do the
               other day.

     Jim's face drops, seeing his death unfold.

                         JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)
                   (continuing with his prepared
                    speech)
               Now, you may have tried it in the
               shower, or maybe in bed at night, and
               not even known what you were doing.
               Or perhaps you've heard your friends
               talking about it in the locker room.

     Jim's eyes dart about, looking for a place to hide.

                         JIM
               Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I
               know what you're talking about.

                         JIM'S DAD
               Sure you know, son, but I think you've
               been having a little problem with it.
               It's okay, though.  What you're doing
               is perfectly normal.  It's like
               practice.  Like when you play tennis
               against a wall.  Some day, there'll be
               a partner returning the ball.
                   (a beat)
               You do want a partner, don't you son?

                         JIM
                   (through clenched teeth)
               Yes.

                         JIM'S DAD
               That's great.  Now remember, it's okay
               to play with yourself.  Or, as I
               always called it --
                   (elbows Jim)
               "Stroke the salami!"
                   (chuckles)
               Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be
               ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and
               I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle
               Mort masturbates.  We all masturbate.

     Nauseated and entirely disoriented, Jim tries to stumble
     back into his room.  He SMACKS the doorframe.  Keeps
     going, slamming the door behind him.  A beat.

                         JIM'S DAD (cont'd)
               Poor guy thought he was the only one.

     EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

     The football field also doubles as the lacrosse field.
     East Great Falls is battling Central.  It's a rough game,
     muddy, brutal.  We see Oz grunting and groaning, playing
     very tough.

     On the sidelines, we see Heather has shown up.  She's
     watching the game -- and is impressed as she watches Oz's
     agility and domination.  Oz runs up the field, cradling
     the ball in his stick.  A couple CENTRAL PLAYERS try to
     check him.  Heather cringes with each impact, and is then
     excited to see Oz dodge his opponents.

     Finally, Oz scores with a triumphant YELL.  Heather
     CHEERS with the crowd as the EGF players congratulate
     each other.

     EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

     After the game.  Oz sees Heather waiting for him on the
     sidelines.  He's about to run over when COACH MARSHALL
     snags him --

                         COACH MARSHALL
               Good work, Ostreicher.

                         OZ
               Thanks coach.

                         COACH MARSHALL
               You're a killer, Ozzy!

                         OZ
                   (trying to get away)
               -- Thanks, coach --

     FOLLOW WITH OZ as he trots over to Heather, covered in
     mud.

                           OZ
               Hey, what're you doing here?

                         HEATHER
               Just enjoying my exhilarating first
               lacrosse experience.  You like,
               "kicked butt."

     A clod of mud falls from Oz's uniform onto Heather's
     skirt.

                         OZ
                   (brushing it off her skirt)
               Whoops, excuse me...

     Oz wipes the mud from his hands.  A beat.  Heather has
     something to say that's not quite coming out.

                         HEATHER
               Um...Chris --

                         OZ
               You can call me Oz.

                         HEATHER
               Do I have to?

                         OZ
               You can call me Ostreicher.

                         HEATHER
               What's your middle name?

                         OZ
               Forget it.

                         HEATHER
               Come on!  I won't tell.

                         OZ
               Neither will I.

                         HEATHER
               Okay.
                   (pause)
               So I had this...thought, and...this
               may seem like it's out of left field,
               and I don't know if you can, but since
               I'm not going with anyone --

     Before she can finish, Stifler runs up, sweaty and
     excited.

                         STIFLER
               Hah!  Central sucks!
                   (noticing Heather)
               Choir Chick?  What the hell are you
               doing here?

                         HEATHER
               Well, I uh, I was --
                   (decides to stand her ground)
               I was asking Chris to prom.
                   (turns to Oz)
               So do you wanna go?

     Oz is surprised at her directness.  Impressed.

                         OZ
               Yeah!

                         STIFLER
               Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for
               the limo.

                         OZ
               Stifler, fuck --
                   (noticing Heather, "sensitive")
               ...man, you don't have to be so
               insensitive.

     A beat.

                         STIFLER
               What??
                   (he dismisses it)
               Whatever -- look uh, don't forget --
               my cottage after prom.  On Lake
               Michigan.

     Stifler joins some other LACROSSE BUDDIES.

                         OZ
               Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the
               showers, but...I think this'll be
               really good.

                         HEATHER
               Yeah, me too, okay, cool.

     They share a smile.  Then Heather walks off towards her
     car.  Oz trots off to Stifler and the other lacrosse
     guys.

                         STIFLER
               My man Oz, working it with the choir
               babes?

                         LACROSSE BUDDIES
                   (cheering, slapping him)
               Yeah, go Oz! etc.

     Oz laughs, embarrassed.

                         OZ
                   (pandering to them)
               Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig
               those cute little sweaters she wears.

                         STIFLER
               I'll bet you do, you little horndog,
               she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies,
               right?

     Stifler goes into what can only be described as the Spank-
     Me-And-Fuck-Me-Like-A-Whore-Dance.

                         STIFLER (CONT'D)
               Yeah!  Sing for me!  yes!

     The other guys LAUGH.  Oz joins in, laughing in spite of
     himself.  They all high-five.

     And from the other side of the field, we see Heather
     peering over at them.  Hardly believing it as Oz joins in
     the laughter.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY

     English class.  The TEACHER is wrapping up a lecture.

                         TEACHER
               So once Hal becomes king, he has to
               take on the responsibilities of
               leadership, and turn his back on his
               old, drunken friend, Falstaff.  You
               see, Hal was going through a rite of
               passage, much like you all are.  Make
               the most of the time you've got left
               together.  You'll miss it later.

     Jim, Kevin, and Oz sit in the back of the classroom in
     one corner.

                         OZ
               So does your tongue cramp up?

                         KEVIN
               Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.

                         JIM
               Wow, that's amazing, she's probably
               gonna want to do it soon.

     Kevin shrugs as the BELL RINGS.  Sherman passes by.

                         SHERMAN
               Still questing after the holy grail,
               eh guys?

     He CHUCKLES and exits.  The guys stand up, exiting the
     classroom.

                         JIM
               Hey, where's Finch?

                         KEVIN
               Went home to shit.

                         JIM
               I don't get it.  How does a guy like
               that get this sudden reputation?

                         OZ
               What reputation?

                         KEVIN
               Observe.

     He taps a passing RANDOM CUTE GIRL on the shoulder.

                         KEVIN (cont'd)
               Excuse me.  Do you know who Paul
               Finch is?

                         RANDOM CUTE GIRL
               Of course!  Have you guys seen his
               tattoo?

                         KEVIN
               ...Yes?

                         RANDOM CUTE GIRL
               Is it cool?  I heard it was like an
               eagle, blazing in fire and stuff.

                         JIM
                   (nods, loving it)
               Actually, it's an eagle and this big
               python.

                         RANDOM CUTE GIRL
               Really?!

                         JIM
               Yeah, see it's on his stomach, here,
               and the eagle -- the eagle is actually
               grasping the python in its talons, so
               the snake is like his --

                         KEVIN
                   (interrupting)
               That's good, Jim.

                         RANDOM CUTE GIRL
               Woah, no way!  That guy is so cool!

     She hurries off to tell her friends.  The guys exit the
     classroom.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR HIGH LOCKERS - CONTINUING

                         OZ
               Okay, explain.

                         KEVIN
               I can't, I have no idea how he's doing
               it.  And that leaves you trailing,
               Jim.  You gotta get your act together.

                         JIM
                   (a little aggravated)
               Yeah, I know.  I'm working on it.

     Jim turns around -- to find Nadia is standing right in
     front of him.  Jim says nothing.  Stuck.  Staring.  Oz
     elbows him.  Jim gives a startled GRUNT.

                         NADIA
               You are very good in the world history
               class, yes?

                         JIM
                   (gulps)
               Me?

     Jim looks over to Kevin and Oz, who excitedly give him
     encouraging looks and gestures.

                         JIM (CONT'D)
                   (trying to decipher the guys'
                    signals)
               Yes.  No.  Yes.

                         NADIA
               Perhaps you can help me with my
               studies?

     The guys nod, "Yes!  Yes!"

                         JIM
               Okay...that would be cool sometime.
                   (sees the guys gesticulating)
               How 'bout tomorrow?

                         NADIA
               Well, I do have ballet practice.
               Perhaps I can come by your house
               afterwards.  I can change clothes at
               your place?

                         JIM
                   (barely, overwhelmed)
               I suppose that would be okay.

     Nadia walks off.  Jim collapses into Oz's and Kevin's
     arms, like a marathon runner at the end of a race.  They
     pat him heartily in congratulations.

     EXT. RAST GREAT FALLS - SIDE OF SCHOOL - DAY

     After school.  Oz is there as Heather pulls up in a new
     Saab.

                         OZ
               Nice car.

                         HEATHER
               I'm glad you think so.

                         OZ
               You don't like it?

                         HEATHER
               No, I like the car.
                   (then, direct)
               By the way, though, about prom?  That
               was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited
               you.

     She hastily walks towards the school.

                         OZ
               What?!

                         HEATHER
               Oh, please.  I asked you because I
               thought you might actually be worth
               going with.  But you are just a jock.
               No wait.  You're a jerk.

                         OZ
               What?  No I'm not.

                         HEATHER
               I saw you making fun of me with your
               lacrosse buddies.

                         OZ
               I wasn't making fun of you.

                         HEATHER
               Give me a break, you're so full of it.

     She hurries up more, breaking off from Oz, and enters the
     school.  After a moment, he slowly heads in.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - LATER

     Oz and Heather are singing with the group, at opposite
     ends of the room.  It's a pop, contemporary arrangement
     of "HOW SWEET IT IS."  It sounds jazzy, cool.

     Oz looks dazed, like the wind's taken out of him.  He
     sings along, distant.  Heather, almost defiantly, sings
     clearer and better than ever.  Oz watches her, though she
     never looks his way.  At the bride of the song, Heather
     breaks into a solo.  She sings beautifully.  Oz is
     hooked.

     The Choir Teacher halts the song.

                         CHOIR TEACHER
               Okay, Heather, that was good, but I
               want to thicken up that solo.
               Michigan State is this Saturday, and I
               want that part to smoke.

                         HEATHER
               I know, my timing's off.

                         CHOIR TEACHER
               A little, but I think it'll work
               better as a duet.  With a tenor part.

                         OZ
                   (interrupting)
               I'll do it.

     A beat as the Choir Teacher is impressed and Heather
     looks indifferent.

                         OZ (CONT'D)
               I'll do it.

                         CHOIR TEACHER
               Okay then.  The rest of you okay with
               that?

     The rest of the choir agrees, as Heather looks to Oz with
     skepticism.

                         CHOIR TEACHER (CONT'D)
               Great.  See you tomorrow.

     The group starts packing up.

                         HEATHER
                   (annoyed)
               Why are you doing this?

                         OZ
               Because I want to.

                         HEATHER
               Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way
               through this.  You better practice.

     She leaves.

               Fuck me!  You're gonna have a naked
               Eastern-European chick in your house,
               and you're telling me you're not gonna
               take advantage of that?

                         JIM
               What am I gonna do, broadcast her over
               the internet?

                         OZ
               You can do that?

                         JIM
                   (off their looks)
               Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.

                         STIFLER
               Dammit, Jim, get some fucking balls.
               If you don't have the guts to
               photograph a naked chick in your room,
               how are you ever gonna sleep with one?
               Now all you gotta do is set up some
               sort of private link or whatever on
               the net, and tell me the address.

     The guys ponder this.

                         KEVIN
               You can send me the address too.

                         JIM
               Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how
               the hell am I gonna watch?

               I'll save you a seat.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Jim is setting the computer camera on top of the monitor.
     The computer BINGS.

                         COMPUTER VOICE
               "You have established an internet
               connection."

     Jim sits.  Types a quick E-mail.  It reads:  "OH YEAH!
     128.220.27.102/tempt/NadiaVision.  ENJOY!"

     Jim scrolls through his list of E-mail addresses.
     Highlights a listing.  Clicks "Send."

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Kevin and Finch sit in front of a computer.  Kevin is
     unloading beer and chips from a grocery bag.

     We see an image of Jim's bedroom on the computer screen.
     It's a little strobed, but easily watchable.  Suddenly
     Jim's face pops into frame.  He's adjusting the camera.

                         KEVIN
               There we go.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

     We see the same image on Jim's screen.  Jim turns off
     just the monitor.  It looks like the computer is off --
     the ruse is undetectable.

     Jim's dad enters with Nadia.  She's in sweats and a
     leotard, carrying a duffel bag over her shoulder.  Jim's
     dad is delighted, fidgety, almost giddy.

                         JIM'S DAD
               Son.  This lady's here for you.

                         JIM
                   (like it's no big deal)
               I know.  Hey Nadia.

                         NADIA
               Hello James.  Ready to study.

                         JIM'S DAD
               Oh, you bet he is.  Jim's quite the
               bookworm.

                         JIM
               Dad.

                         JIM'S DAD
               Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm.
               He's a good little kid.  Er, guy.
               Man.

                         JIM
               Dad!!

                         JIM'S DAD
               Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those
               books.

     Jim's dad gives a knowing look and exits.

     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

     STIFLER'S YOUNGER BROTHER, 11, a monster, is tugging at
     Stifler, who sits at the computer, watching Jim's room.

                         STIFLER'S BROTHER
               Steve!  Steve!  It's my computer and I
               wanna use it!

                         STIFLER
               Shut up and watch this, you might
               learn something.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

                         JIM
               So you need to change, right?

                         NADIA
               Do you mind?  This fabric is so
               uncomfortable.

     She sets her duffel on Jim's bed.

                         JIM
               No, go right ahead and get dressed.
               I'll just be downstairs, studying up.
               Get me when you're ready.

     Jim exits, closing the door behind him.

     He's off!  Jim sprints down the hall.  Thunders down the
     stairs.

     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - CONTINUING

     Jim's Mom and Dad are sitting downstairs.  Jim bolts
     through the room.

                         JIM
               Be back in a sec!

     He practically crashes through the door on his way out.

                         JIM'S MOM
               Jim?  Honey, where are you going?

     She turns and looks at her husband.  Both perplexed.

     EXT. STREET - CONTINUING

     Jim runs like hell.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

     Nadia unzips her duffel, pulling some clothes out.

     EXT. KEVIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUING

     Jim trucks across the lawn to the door.

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Kevin and Finch are watching the computer screen.

                         KEVIN
               Want a beer?

     Finch simply waves off the question.  He's glued to the
     screen.

     Jim bursts into the room, breathless.

                         JIM
               Did I miss anything?!

                         KEVIN
               Just in time.

     Jim grabs a seat by the computer.  All three guys watch,
     transfixed.  Nadia is slipping out of her leotard.

                         JIM
               Woah!

     Nadia's leotard is off.  Bra and panties.  Outstanding
     body.

     INTERCUT BETWEEN JIM'S BEDROOM and the guys around the
     computer screen in Kevin's Bedroom.

     Nadia pauses.  Looks in Jim's full-length mirror.
     Admiring her body.

                         KEVIN
               Oh, man!  This is incredible.

     And...yes!  Nadia peels off her sportsbra.  Supple
     breasts.  The guys are awestruck.

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
               I can't believe Oz had to work.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - DAY

     Oz sits alone in the empty vocal jazz rehearsal area.  He
     sighs, leafing through some sheet music.  It's as quiet
     and boring as can be.

     Stifler and his brother are awestruck.

                         STIFLER'S BROTHER
               This is like the coolest thing I've
               ever seen.

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING

                         JIM
               Oh, thank you Lord, for this wonderful
               day.

     Nadia still primps in the mirror.  Then she looks around.
     Very carefully, she pokes through the stuff on Jim's
     night table.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Hey!  You can't touch my stuff!

     Nadia opens the night table.  Stops.  Jim flushes.  Nadia
     delicately reaches into the night table as Jim crumbles.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Oh no no no.

     She pulls out the stack of porno magazines.

                         KEVIN
               Nice collection there, Jim.

     Nadia takes a PENTHOUSE.  Starts thumbing through it.
     She sits on Jim's bed.  Lingering on some pages.  Getting
     aroused.

                         JIM
               Dear God -- she's -- she's -- she's --

     Welcome to every man's fantasy.  Nadia's hand wanders
     into her panties.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Gentlemen, I'd like to make an
               announcement.  There is a gorgeous
               woman masturbating on my bed.

     The guys watch, completely blown away.  Nadia's lost
     herself.

                         KEVIN
               You know, Jim...you could go back
               there...and...

                         FINCH
                   (nodding)
               Seduce her.

                         JIM
               But, but -- what would I do?

                         KEVIN
               Anything!  Just tell her it looks like
               she needs an extra hand or something.

                         JIM
               That's stupid.

                         KEVIN
               No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right
               now!  She's primed!

                         JIM
               Oh...oh...oh, shit!

     He BOLTS across the room.

     Jim sprints across the lawn.

     Jim crashes into the house and runs past his bewildered
     parents.

                         JIM

     He rushes up the stairs.  Jim's Dad looks hopeful.

     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUING

     Jim stops outside his door, catching his breath.  He can
     hear FAINT MOANING from inside.  He's hesitating.

               Jim must've addressed that E-mail
               wrong.  It went out to every mailbox

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Jim stands there, bewildered.  Nadia hasn't noticed him,
     eyes closed, still pleasuring herself.  Jim stands there,
     watching, faltering.  Gathers his courage.  Finally, he
     rolls his eyes and says --

                         JIM
               Looks like you could use an extra
               hand.

               Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my

               Strip?

                         NADIA
               Yes, slowly.

     Jim sneaks a nervous glance over to the QuickCam.

                         JIM
               You mean like, strip strip?

               No idea.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING

     Nadia leans over to Jim's clock radio.  Turns it on.  We
     hear COUNTRY MUSIC.  She flips the dial, and we hear A
     FEW STATIONS FLIP BY.  Then a DRIVING, EURO-TECHNO SONG.

                         NADIA
               Perfect.

     She turns to Jim.

                         JIM
               Uh...

                         NADIA
               Move with the music.

                         JIM
               Um...okay...

     He struts clumsily back and forth.  Takes his shirt off.
     Swings it in a circle around his head...and lets go of
     it, aiming for the QuickCam, where it lands.

                         NADIA
               No, no, you must put your whole body
               into it.

                         JIM
               Nadia, I can't --

                         NADIA
               Can't what?  Do you not want to be
               with me?  I wish to be entertained,
               James.

     Jim nods eagerly.  Concentrates on the music...as we see
     the shirt slide off the camera.  Jim starts writhing to
     the beat.  Like a hyperactive chicken.

     INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

     A GROUP OF GIRLS watches in amusement.

                         GIRL IN BEDROOM
               Work it, baby!

     The LAUGH and dance mockingly along with Jim.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING

     Jim tugs off his pants, dancing and tripping on them.

                         NADIA
                   (turned on)
               More sexy, Jim, more sexy.

     Jim is clearly excited by Nadia's prodding.  He does some
     pathetically ridiculous move with his pants, sliding them
     around his chest and neck.

     INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUING

     A GROUP OF GIRLS is watching.

                         DISINTERESTED GIRL
               He's no Paul Finch.

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME

     Kevin and Finch are now completely sickened.

                         FINCH
               This is truly revolting.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING

     Jim is straddled over a chair, grinding against the chair
     back, in his boxers and shorts.

                         NADIA
                   (getting really turned on)
               More, more, you bad boy!

     Jim starts spanking his ass as he gyrates.

     INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME

     The guys are all trying not to watch, yet still drawn to
     the computer.

                         GUY #1
               Ugh...God...

     INT. JIM'S COMPUTER - DAY - CONTINUING

                         NADIA
               Now!  Hames, come to me.

                         JIM
               Oh yeah!

     Jim dances over to her.  She pulls him onto the bed.
     Kisses his neck.  Takes his hand.  Places it on her
     thigh.

                         NADIA
               Be gentle.

     Jim GULPS.

               This just got a hell of a lot better.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Jim's hand wanders up Nadia's leg.  She does the same to
     him.  Blows in his ear.  Her hand is about to enter his
     shorts.

     And Jim is done.  Bang.  That's it.

     He looks down at himself in terror.  Nadia sees.  Backs
     away.

                         NADIA
               Jim...

                         JIM

               What happened?!  What happened?!

                         STIFLER
               He blew it.  Literally.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Nadia is getting dressed.

                         NADIA
               You are done, James.  Perhaps I should
               be going now.

                         JIM
               No, no, I'm not done!  I've got
               reserves!  Nadia, please please
               please.  I'm begging you.

     She sees the desperation in his eyes.  Thinks about it.
     Smiles.

                         NADIA
               I do like your dirty magazines.

     Jim digs into the stack of pornos.  Grabs SHAVED.

                         JIM
               Did you see this?  This is your more
               exotic dirty magazine.

                         NADIA
               Yes...James, it is knowing that these
               beautiful women arouse you that
               arouses me...

                         JIM
               Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They
               arouse me very much.  But not as
               arousing as you.

     She goes for this line.  Gives in.

                         NADIA
               Oh Jim...

     She grabs him.  Starts caressing his body.

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

                         GUY #1
               He's re-engaging!

     A CHEER goes up as the guys CELEBRATE.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Groping.  They're tangled in each other.  Nadia backs off
     for a moment.  Slowly, teasing, she hooks her thumbs in
     the sides of her panties.  Starts sliding them down.

                         NADIA
               So, "shaved" is the expression?

     CLOSE UP on Jim as his eyes bug out.  Yep, it is, and she
     is.

                         JIM
                   (mutters)
               Holy shit.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Jim is stuck.  Staring at Nadia.  She moves towards him.
     Nadia is inches from his face.

                         NADIA
               Touch me Jim...here.

     Jim is trembling, straining with himself.  A shudder runs
     through him.

     And it's over, again.

     INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUING

     The girls are LAUGHING again.

                         GIRLS
               Again?

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

                         KEVIN
               Not again.

     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY

                         JIM
               No, not again.

                         NADIA
                   (sighs)
               I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will
               not be doing any studying now.

                         JIM
               No!  I've got...reserve reserves!

     Nadia starts getting dressed.  Jim is whimpering.

                         NADIA
               It is too bad.  I was at first hoping
               you would ask me to the prom.  But...

     She gathers her things.  Eyes Jim over.

                         NADIA (cont'd)
               You should change your shorts.

                         JIM
               ...okay.

     Jim is stunned.  Ruined.  Nadia exits.  CLOSE on Jim's
     tormented face as we hear...

                         COMPUTER VOICE
               "You have lost your internet
               connection.  Click 'okay' to
               reconnect."

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

     Jim is walking through the courtyard, a bit dazed.  A
     COUPLE GIRLS pass by him, giggling.  He trudges
     along...noticing a CLIQUE OF GIRLS staring at him as he
     passes by...and Stoner #1 giving him a peace sign...and
     the Computer Nerd staring at him like a celebrity......
     Jim's pace slows.  He hears a SNICKER behind him...he
     slows even more, taking very careful steps...as he sees a
     GIRL doing a really strange dance -- and his eyes pop out
     as he sees that, yes, it's his dance.  He stops.  ALMOST
     EVERYONE is staring at him.  Jim pulls his coat up over
     his face and hurries off into the school, like a fugitive
     avoiding the media.  People APPLAUD and LAUGH.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALLWAY - DAY

     Kevin and Oz catch up to Jim.  Here and there, people
     still give Jim funny looks.

                         KEVIN
               Hey, minuteman.

                         JIM
               Shut up.  You're supposed to be
               supportive.

                         OZ
               You've still got a chance with Nadia,
               right?

                         JIM
               No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing
               on the net.  I don't think they liked
               it.

                         KEVIN
               How do you know that?

                         JIM
               She's already on a plane back home.

     Kevin winces.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               You know, maybe I'm just not good with
               girls, period.  Like I was born
               without that part of the brain.  I
               mean, I can't talk to girls.  And when
               I do talk to them, I screw it up.

                         KEVIN
               Yeah?  Well come prom night, those
               excuses aren't going to do you much
               good.

                         JIM
               Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.

     A nearby OLD JANITOR starts GUFFAWING at Jim as he walks
     by.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY

     Jim sits, waiting for class to start.  Miserable.  Some
     students are obviously talking about him in the
     background.  Others study and chat.

     Next to Jim is Michelle -- the reject, band dork that
     we've seen earlier.  She's got a flute case on her desk.
     She's blabbering to Jim.  The kind of blabbering where
     every other sentence sounds like a question, even though
     it isn't.

                         MICHELLE
               And so, one time?  I was at band camp?
               And we weren't supposed to have pillow
               fights?  But we had a pillow fight!
               And it was so much fun!

     Jim couldn't care.

                         MICHELLE (cont'd)
               And one time, we all lost our music?
               And we were supposed to play this
               song?  But we didn't know it.  So we
               just made it up!  And we kept playing
               and playing but the conductor didn't
               know what we were doing and it was so
               funny!

     Jim looks wistfully over at Nadia's empty desk.

                         MICHELLE (cont'd)
               So you're pissed about something, huh?
               You know what I do when I'm angry?  I
               just play some Bach on my flute.  It's
               so relaxing.  I learned to do that at
               band camp.

     Jim perks up the slightest bit.

                         JIM
               Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm
               angry?

                         MICHELLE
               Is it because we have a test tomorrow?
               Sometimes I get cranky when I know I
               have a big test to study for.

                         JIM
               Yeah, that's pretty much it.

                         MICHELLE
               I thought so.  Because, one time?  I
               was at this --

                         JIM
                   (interrupting)
               What was your name again?

                         MICHELLE
               Michelle.

                         JIM
               Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my
               date for the prom?

                         MICHELLE
               Really?  You seriously want to go with
               me?

                         JIM
                   (so forced)
               Yes.  Seriously.

                         MICHELLE
               Are we going to Steve Stifler's party
               afterwards?  That would be so cool.

                         JIM
               Whatever you want.

                         MICHELLE
               Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun!
               It's like this one time, at band
               camp...

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER

     Heather is walking down the hall.  She turns to go into
     the Little Auditorium -- and through the window in the
     door she sees Oz.  She stops.

     Oz is singing, working through the solo.  Determined to
     get it right.  He bounces his lacrosse ball off the
     floor, in rhythm, keeping time.  There's one point that
     he keeps getting stuck at and going back over.  Heather
     watches this, softening as she sees that Oz is actually
     putting his heart into it.  Finally he's frustrated --

                         OZ
               Dammit!

     He whips the lacrosse ball at the wall.  Heather recoils,
     still watching, unseen by Oz.  After a moment, Oz cools
     off.  He gets the ball, and diligently starts up again.
     Heather is impressed.

     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Vicky is doing calculus homework, as Kevin looks on,
     rubbing her shoulders.

                         KEVIN
               You're not doing the extra credit
               problems.

                         VICKY
               No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence
               of random numbers that look like I'm
               doing the extra credit problems.  Mr.
               Bender doesn't bother to check
               homework past April.

                         KEVIN
               That's my trick!

                         VICKY
               It's everyone's trick, Kevin.
                   (she turns to him)
               But I did pick it up from you.

     She gives him a little kiss on his hand, continuing with
     her work.  Kevin keeps rubbing her back, more serious.

                         KEVIN
               We've come a long way since
               Homecoming.

                         VICKY
                   (playful)
               Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four-
               point into a three-nine-five.

                         KEVIN
               Indeed I did.  But, our relationship.
               It's progressed a lot.  It's time for
               us to...express ourselves in new ways.

     Vicky stops working and turns, sitting up on the desk,
     facing him.  Her mood has shifted, more romantic.

                         VICKY
               Like how?

                         KEVIN
               Well, I feel that...things are getting
               to that point in a relationship.
               When two people share...a special
               moment between them.

                         VICKY
               I think you're so right, Kevin.

                         KEVIN
                   (pause)
               You want to do it?

                         VICKY
               Yes --

     She takes his hand.  Readies herself, and declares.

                         VICKY (CONT'D)
               I love you.

     Kevin falters.  This is definitely not what he was
     expecting.  He's caught.  Trying to formulate a response.

                         VICKY (CONT'D)
               Kevin?  Do you not love me?

                         KEVIN
               No, I don't not love you.  I like, I
               know that we've definitely got
               something between us.  Something good.
               Something special.

                         VICKY
               But you don't love me.

                         KEVIN
               I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's
               like a term that gets thrown around.
               People say things, they get married,
               have kids, and then what?  It's like
               they call it off, going "I was wrong."

     A beat.  Vicky seems to know where he's coming from.

                         VICKY
               Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two
               of us, we're not your parents.

                         KEVIN
               I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet,
               okay?

                         VICKY
               Okay.

     INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

     Oz is closing up the store.  He looks up to see Heather
     at the door.  Oz goes and opens it, surprised,
     embarrassed.  The air is awkward between them.

                         HEATHER
               Hi...

                         OZ
               How did you know I was here?

                         HEATHER
               Stifler told me.

                         OZ
               You talked to Stifler?

                         HEATHER
               Well...I needed to find you.  We are
               gonna have to practice that song.

                         OZ
               ...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad
               you came by.  I mean, really.

     She smiles.  Oz lets her in.

                         HEATHER
               So you like, work nights?

     An uncomfortable moment for Oz.

                         OZ
               Uh...my dad's the manager.

                         HEATHER
               Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are
               great.

                         OZ
               Ah, he's always too heavy on the
               vinegar.  If you really want a good
               one, you gotta let me make it.

     INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

     Oz is behind the counter.  Heather walks down the other
     side as Oz assembles a sub.

                         OZ
               My dad's always here running the
               store, busy and stuff...and I fill in
               once a week so he can get a night off.

                         HEATHER
                   (pause)
               That's nice.

                         OZ
                   (shrugs)
               So you're going to Michigan?

                         HEATHER
               Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go
               to Northwestern.  I didn't want to
               write all those extra essays they make
               you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to
               know what my "most emotionally
               significant moment" was?  So when my U
               of M acceptance came in December, I
               said the hell with it.

                         OZ
               Onions?

                         HEATHER
               What?

                         OZ
               You want onions?

                         HEATHER
               Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major
               in?

                         OZ
               Well, State's got a good business
               school.  And I can probably walk onto
               the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?

                         HEATHER
               Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured
               out.

                         OZ
                   (dismissive)
               Well, I mean, business is okay, and
               lacrosse is awesome, but what am I
               gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I
               really have no idea.

                         HEATHER
               Oh thank God, I thought I was the only
               one.

                         OZ
               Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?

                         HEATHER
               Yeah.  You know, people are always
               like, "What're you gonna major in?"
               And I don't know.  And they're like,
               "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?

                         OZ
               I know.  Salt and pepper?

                         HEATHER
               Sure.

     Oz cuts the sub in half with a flourish and puts it on a
     tray.

                         HEATHER (CONT'D)
               So we're gonna be close next year?

                         OZ
               You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East
               Lansing and Ann Arbor.

                         HEATHER
                   (smiles)
               ...yeah.

     A beat...a little uncomfortable, but nice.

                         OZ
               Wanna swap your chips for cookies?

     EXT. SUBWAY - NIGHT - LATER

     The remains of a couple subs are on a table.  Oz and
     Heather are doing their song...it's rough, but they're
     working through it.  And when they're in sync, they sound
     really good together.  We SLOWLY PULL BACK as they sing
     into the night.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MURAL STAIRCASE - DAY

     A GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH talks to Stifler.

                         GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH
               I'm sorry, I really can't go with
               you...I'm holding out for someone
               else.

                         STIFLER
               You gotta be fucking kidding.

                         GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH
               I know it's a long shot, but I figure
               Paul Finch might ask me.

                         STIFLER
               FINCH?  SHITBREAK?!!

                         GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH
               Oh gosh, I forgot -- you uh, you look
               okay...I mean you can't even tell...

     Flustered, she heads down the stairs.  Stifler, entirely
     confused, heads off into the second floor.  As the Girl
     Holding Out For Finch descends, Kevin catches up with
     her.

                         KEVIN
               Hey...what was that all about?

                         GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH
               He's still embarrassed because Finch
               kicked his ass.  Knocked out a tooth,
               but you can't see it.

                         KEVIN
               Right, and who told you that?

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

     Kevin is talking to GRETA.  She points offscreen.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LIBRARY - DAY

     Kevin is talking to SOME CHICK.  Taking notes.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - OUTDOOR MURAL - DAY

     Kevin is talking to YET ANOTHER GIRL.  We see that his
     notepad is a spiderweb of girl's names, all interlinked
     with arrows.  They all point to one girl's name in the
     center of the page -- Jessica.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

     Kevin follows Jessica down the cafeteria line.

                         JESSICA
               No comment.

                         KEVIN
               No comment?!  Are you kidding me?!
               I've never seen someone's image change
               so...so drastically!

                         JESSICA
               Thanks.  It was my idea.

                         KEVIN
               Did you guys hook up or something?

                         JESSICA
               Are you kidding?  No.

                         KEVIN
               Then what the hell are you talking
               about?

                         JESSICA
               Well...I guess it's okay for me to
               tell you now.  That reputation of his
               isn't going anywhere.
                   (then)
               Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica,
               I need help with this, blah blah,
               etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two-
               hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple
               girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So
               he did, and I did.

                         KEVIN
               I don't get it, that really works?

                         JESSICA
               Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I
               embellished a little bit.  Hey, did
               you hear that Finch had sex with an
               older woman?

     Kevin is speechless.

                         JESSICA (CONT'D)
               No?  Damn, that one was my favorite.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GUY'S SHOWERS/LOCKER ROOM - DAY

     Toweled guys exit the steamy showers, doing a macho GREAT
     FALLS LACROSSE CHANT.  They exit frame, and we remain on
     the showers, to hear --

                         OZ
                   (singing happily)
               ...I needed the shelter of someone's
               arms...there you were -- woo-hoo-
               hoo...

     He exits in a towel and goes to his locker, next to
     Stifler.

                         OZ (CONT'D)
                   (still singing)
               ...I needed someone to understand my
               ups and my downs, oh baby there you
               were...

     Stifler is staring at Oz, horrified.

                         STIFLER
               Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.

                         OZ
                   (cheery)
               Come on, you know the words, sing
               along.

                         STIFLER
               No thanks, you've been singing that
               shit all week.  If you try that at MSU
               this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't
               know you.

     Oz stops.

                         OZ
               Our last game is this Saturday.

                         STIFLER
               No shit.

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD, A BENCH - LATER

     Heather is studying outside.  Oz stands before her,
     breathless, his hair still wet.

                         OZ
               ...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's
               really important, it's our last game.
               And you know, Central almost beat us
               last time, so I really want to kick
               their ass, and it's like cool because
               we're gonna get to play at State,
               which means that after the game I
               might be able to stop by...

                         HEATHER
                   (pause)
               You can't sing at the competition.

                         OZ
               I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I
               just...I didn't realize it...

                         HEATHER
                   (upset but trying to be cool)
               ...it's okay, you should do whatever
               makes you happy.

                         OZ
               Alright...yeah...thanks for
               understanding.
                   (a beat)
               So I guess...I'll see you later.

     An uncomfortable moment.  Oz walks off.  Heather looks
     let down.

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - ENTRANCE TO SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

     Kevin is at his locker, getting ready for class.  Stifler
     comes running up with a wicked grin on his face.

                         STIFLER
               Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?

                         KEVIN
                   (immediately sensing danger)
               Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?

                         STIFLER
               Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass
               he kicked.
                   (off Kevin's look)
               I'll tell you one thing, though.  I
               don't think he's gonna have a problem
               shitting in school anymore.

     Stifler pulls out an empty bottle of PRESCRIPTION
     LAXATIVE, maniacally LAUGHING.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

     Finch is sitting at a table, reading his paper.  Kevin
     comes tearing around the corner and runs up to him.

                         KEVIN
               Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!

                         FINCH
               Easy, tiger.  What's in there?

                         KEVIN
               Just go!

                         FINCH
               Why is this?

                         KEVIN
               You're gonna shit your pants!

                         FINCH
               Charming.

                         KEVIN
               Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some
               sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino
               or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I
               mean really fast.

                         FINCH
               First of all, it's Mochaccino, and
               secondly...Oohhhh!

     Finch jumps up and sprints down the hallway.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - CONTINUING

     We FOLLOW with Finch.  We see Stifler down the hall,
     holding open the bathroom door like a pleasant doorman.

                         STIFLER
               This way, sit.

     Finch darts into the bathroom.  Stifler LAUGHS
     hysterically.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY

     Finch leaps into a stall and slams the door behind him.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

     Finch has stopped.  He's staring down at the toilet.  It
     looks entirely uninviting.  But he's straining,
     struggling, starting to dance around, moaning as he
     cramps up.

     He grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with
     it.  Then another, and another.  Sweat drips off his
     forehead.

                         FINCH
               Come on come on come on...

     He's got the seat lined with at least three layers of
     toilet paper.  Notices a spot where there's still bare
     toilet seat.  He tears off one square of toilet paper,
     placing it on the spot.  He steps back and looks it over,
     still wriggling to contain his bowels.

                         FINCH (CONT'D)
               Okay.  You can do this.

     He unbuckles his pants.  Sits down -- just as we hear
     someone enter the bathroom.  Finch, still restraining,
     listens for a moment...only to hear the CLICK-CLICK-CLICK
     of heels.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY

     The bathroom door swings closed to reveal the universal
     symbol for "Women."  Stifler is there, LAUGHING even
     harder.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

     Finch is terrified.  Through the crack between the stall
     door and the frame, Finch catches glimpses of bright
     colored skirts and dresses.  He grits his teeth,
     straining.

     And a GURGLE comes from Finch's stomach.  His eyes bulge.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY

     A GROUP OF GIRLS is at the mirror, including the Girl
     Holding Out for Finch, fixing their hair.

                         GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH
               You know it's just gonna be some
               crappy band and stupid decorations.

                         GIRL #2
               You're just saying that cause prom's a
               week away and you don't have a date.

                         GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH
               No, I don't want a date...
                   (increasingly dreamy)
               Finch is going stag...and so am
               I...the guy is like so...debonair.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

     Finch is in hell.  Desperately trying not to shit.
     Holding it in for all he's worth.

     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

                         GIRL #2
               Do you think that "older woman" thing
               is true?

                         GIRL #3
               Of course, it was Stifler's mom.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

     Pure agony.  Finch is sweating badly.  Every muscle in
     his body is tensed.  Tears stream from his fiercely shut
     eyes.

     A gastric RUMBLING.  Finch's eyes flash open in terror.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY

     We hear another, deeper RUMBLING.  Girl #2 turns to her
     friend in surprise.

                         GIRL #2
               Joanie, was that you?

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

     Finch is struggling.  Rocking back and forth.  But it's
     no use.  He's at his limit.

                         FINCH
               Aaaaaaarrrgghhhh!

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY

     The girls at the mirror freeze -- and we hear what can
     only be the SOUND OF DIARRHEA exploding into a toilet
     bowl.

     The girls run out SCREAMING and LAUGHING.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

     Finch exits the stall with trepidation, pulling up his
     pants.  Slowly, slinking, he approaches the door.  Grabs
     the handle.  Composes himself.  And like nothing ever
     happened, he opens it.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY

     Finch comes out of the bathroom.  Stops.  His eyes
     register complete disbelief.

     A SEMI-CIRCLE OF GIRLS, including the ones we have seen
     gossiping about him, has crowded around the door.  All
     staring at him with complete repugnance, open-mouthed.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY

     Oz is playing in the final lacrosse game.  The team
     scores -- they're beating Central.  Everyone cheers,
     except Oz.  We see Jim and Kevin in the stands, CHEERING.

     EXT. MUSIC HALL (MSU) - DAY

     Establishing.  The campus of Michigan State University.
     Students pass in front of an older, impressive university
     building.

     A sign out front reads, "MICHIGAN STATEWIDE VOCAL
     COMPETITION."

     INT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY

     Heather and the rest of the vocal jazz group are behind
     the curtain.

     They all wear flashy, borderline cool outfits.  Heather
     looks worried, lost.  Looking to the door, as if Oz might
     come running in.

                         VOCAL JAZZ TEACHER
               Okay.  Albert, you ready?

     ALBERT steps next to Heather.  He's kind of funny-
     looking, with an overly-suave attitude that comes off as
     plain weird.

                         ALBERT
               No problemo.

     He SINGS a couple lines.  Way too melodramatic and
     cheesy.  Heather looks trapped.

     EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY

     A scoreboard shows that East is leading by five goals.
     Oz is running up the field, towards the goal, cradling
     the ball in his stick.  He seems to have a good lead.
     Suddenly he is tumbling, falling, losing the ball.
     Someone has checked him.  He lays stunned on the ground,
     as Stifler recovers the ball and scores.

     The players run back to the sidelines to reset for the
     face-off, and gather around the coach.

                         COACH MARSHALL
               Alright!  Good hustle, guys, but we
               can still lose.  You all saw what
               happened to Oz out there.  I don't
               ever want to see you guys thinking
               you're gonna score.  You don't score
               until you score, period.

     The team is getting into it.  Shouts of "Hell yeah!"  But
     Oz's got a quizzical look on his face.

     INT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY

     Heather waits with the group to go onstage.  Albert paces
     like a Shakespearean actor, psyching himself.

                         ALBERT
               Focus on the music.  Think melody.
               Let the music be my guide.

                         HEATHER
               That would be a start.

     EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY

     Oz shows some emotion peeking through.  Confused.

                         COACH MARSHALL
               It all boils down to today.  For you
               seniors, this marks the culmination of
               your past four years.  Think of what
               that means to you.  Are you guys gonna
               look back on your days at East and
               know that you made the most of the
               time you had?

     A wave of realization washes over Oz.  He stands up tall.

                         COACH MARSHALL (cont'd)
               Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher!

     Oz collects himself.  Takes a deep breath.

                         OZ
               Good luck, guys.

     he sets his lacrosse stick down and starts to leave.

                         COACH MARSHALL
               Christ!  I didn't say you were out of
               the game!

                         OZ
               Sorry, coach.

                         COACH MARSHALL
               What the fuck is this?  You got
               someplace more important to be?

     Coach Marshall is fuming.  The entire team is staring at
     Oz.

                         OZ
               Yeah.

     He runs off.

     ANGLE ON JIM AND KEVIN IN THE STANDS

     A beat of confusion.  Then they stand up.

     EXT. MSU CAMPUS - DAY

     Oz runs through a gate.

     INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY

     The vocal jazz group is on their feet, lined up, waiting
     to go onstage.  Oz bursts into the room, still in his
     lacrosse gear.

                         VOCAL JAZZ GUYS
               Oz -- You're back -- Yeah --

                         ALBERT
               -- Oh, great.

     Oz rushes up to Heather.  She's happy but confused.

                         HEATHER
               What about the game?!

                         OZ
               I'm not playing.

                         HEATHER
               You're missing the game for us?!

                         OZ
               No.  I'm missing the game for you.

     Heather melts.  Oz pulls her close.  And they kiss.

                         VOCAL JAZZ TEACHER
               Okay, okay.  You guys got about a
               minute to go.  Spend it warming up,
               not making out.  This ain't the prom
               yet.

     Oz and Heather share a smile.

     INT. MUSIC HALL STAGE - DAY

     The vocal jazz group is belting their hearts out, singing
     "How Sweet It Is."  Oz sings with them now in his vocal
     jazz outfit...we TILT DOWN to see he's still wearing his
     cleats.  He and Heather sound great, backed by the vocal
     jazz group.  They sail through their duet, join hands,
     and finish perfectly.  The audience APPLAUDS with
     enthusiasm -- and we Kevin and Jim, WHOOPING AND
     CLAPPING, loving it, like they're at a rock concert.

                         JIM
               Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!

                         KEVIN
                   (gives that "You rock!" hand
                    sign)
               You fuckin' rule!

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS - CLASSROOM - DAY

     Class has just ended, students are filing out of the
     classroom.  A teacher grades papers in the back of the
     room, routinely writing "A, A-, A, A-" on each paper.
     Vicky is studying a pull-down map hanging over the
     chalkboard.  Kevin comes up next to her.

                         KEVIN
               Hey...

                         VICKY
               Did you know that it's...450 miles
               from Ann Arbor to Nashville?

                         KEVIN
               It's like a six or seven hour drive.
               That's easy, I don't mind driving.

     A beat.  Kevin looks back over his shoulder to the
     inattentive teacher.  Moves closer to Vicky.

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
               About the other day...I've been
               thinking.

                         VICKY
               So have I.  And I know you want to
               make things perfect for me.  And I
               understand that you really wouldn't
               tell me that until you were 100%
               comfortable with it.

     Vicky looks over to the teacher, who COUGHS.  She steps
     closer.  Kevin, somewhat nervous, takes the bottom of the
     map, fidgeting with it a little.

                         VICKY (CONT'D)
               And I want to make things perfect for
               you.  You're right, Kev, we do have
               something good...and special.

                         KEVIN
               Yeah, we have something great, Vick.

                         VICKY
               Kevin...
                   (very close, whispered)
               I want to have sex with you.

     The map goes FLAPPING upwards.  The teacher looks up.

                         KEVIN
                   (almost frightened)
               Now?!

                         VICKY
               No...I know the perfect time...

     She looks to the calendar on the wall...and taps next
     Saturday -- "Prom."  Kevin can't believe it...MUSIC UP
     for PRE-PROM MONTAGE --

     INT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY

     Jim is trying on a tux.  he shrugs, like it fits well
     enough.

     He turns to see Oz trying on his -- Oz is fidgeting,
     trying on different ties, vests, shoes, very sincere and
     focused.

     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Vicky is trying on a rather elegant dress, looking to
     Jessica for support, showing it off.  Jessica jokingly
     does the same, showing off her shorts and T-shirt, as if
     she could care.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

     Finch sits alone.  Not like alone.  More like Forrest
     Gump.

     INT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY

     Jim is paying for his tux.  We see Oz trying to decide on
     a cumberbund.  There are about ten of them scattered
     around him that he's already tried.  In the background,
     an ATTENDANT looks impatient.

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

     Finch still sits.  His head is cocked at a different
     angle.

     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Jim's dad fixes Jim's bow tie.

     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (END MONTAGE)

     Kevin is in his tux.  He's staring at himself in the
     mirror.

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT

     The parking lot is full.  VARIOUS FORMALLY DRESSED
     STUDENTS make their way into the school.  One group piles
     out of a stretch limo.  We see a STEALTHY STUDENT slip a
     bottle of liquor into his tux.  A FLUSTERED GUY struggles
     to re-attach his date's corsage.

     This is the prom.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GYM - NIGHT

     The gym is decorated in a clashingly festive manner.
     Like a combination of Mardi Gras, New Year's Eve, and
     somebody's bar mitzvah.  A CRAPPY BAND plays CRAPPY
     IMITATION ROCK MUSIC.

     Most students mill about, talking, generally bored.  The
     only people who are enjoying themselves are the OBVIOUSLY
     DRUNK STUDENTS, slam-dancing with the obviously drunk
     Stifler in a corner.  CHAPERONE PARENTS try to calm them
     down, futilely.

     The band breaks into a CHEESY BALLAD.  Couples lock
     together and sway back and forth like zombies.

     ANGLE ON JIM AND MICHELLE

     They're dancing at arm's length.  Jim is not enthused.

                         MICHELLE
               You know, at band camp?  We have
               dances like this.  Only they're way
               funner.  Don't you think prom is just
               highly overrated?

                         JIM
               Highly, highly overrated.

     ANGLE ON KEVIN AND VICKY

     They dance.  Both looking a little nervous.  Anxious.

     ANGLE ON OZ AND HEATHER

     Dancing much slower than anyone else.  Tight embrace.
     Heather's got her head on his shoulder, eyes closed.

     ANGLE ON STIFLER

     Dancing with the Girl Holding out For Finch.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - A CORNER OF THE GYM - NIGHT

     Kevin, Oz, Jim, and Finch are hanging out.  Finch is
     drunk.

                         FINCH
               Okay.  I'm here for your dumb...dumb
               meeting.

     Sherman passes by.

                         SHERMAN
               I'm on the offensive, boys.  The
               Sherman Tank is going back in.

     The guys are impassive.  Sherman indicates the Central
     Girl nearby.

                         SHERMAN (CONT'D)
               Locked on target, flying in stealth
               mode under enemy sex radar.  Ready to
               drop the payload...again.

     Sherman confidently walks off.

                         KEVIN
               Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well,
               Finch, I know where you are, but you
               can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?

                         JIM
               My date's a flute-toting band dork.
               That answer your question?

                         KEVIN
               Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now
               you guys are a couple or something?

                         OZ
                   (getting ticked)
               Dammit, Kevin, what's with the
               attitude?

                         KEVIN
               Attitude?  Me?  I think that you guys
               should be more enthusiastic.  Shit,
               we've been trying to get laid forever,
               and tonight's the night we've been
               waiting for.  We're in this together.
               Don't back out on me now!

                         JIM
               Back out?  You don't need us to get
               laid.  You afraid or something?

                         KEVIN
               No, but come on guys, we made a pact!

                         OZ
               Kevin, it was just a --

                         KEVIN
               It was a pact.  You break it and there
               are no excuses.  You guys have to --

                         JIM
                   (interrupting, pissed)
               I don't have to do shit!  Forget it
               already!

     Kevin is taken aback.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               I'm tired of all this bullshit
               pressure!  I mean, I've never even had
               sex and already I can't stand it!  I
               hate sex!  I don't want it, I've never
               wanted it, and I'm not gonna sit here
               busting my balls over something that
               just isn't that damn important!  So
               fuck this stupid pact, fuck you, and
               fuck sex!  Now, I'm gonna go hang out
               with that geek over there, 'cause at
               least she's got something else to talk
               about besides sex!  God damn!

     Kevin storms off.  A beat.

                         FINCH
               At least I learned how to shit in
               school.

     Jessica approaches.  She's dressed well, but not
     lavishly.

                         JESSICA
               Hey, Finch.  Wanna dance?

     Finch looks to the guys.  They shrug.  We FOLLOW WITH
     Jessica and Finch as they dance out onto the floor.

                         FINCH
               How come you have no date?

                         JESSICA
               I like to keep my options open.  And
               let me just clarify that you have no
               chance of scoring with me, Finch.

                         FINCH
               No, of course not, don't be
               ridiculous.

     ANGLE ON VICKY AND CENTRAL GIRL

                         VICKY
               So, I guess you and Sherman are pretty
               close.  You met at that party a while
               back?

                         CENTRAL GIRL
               Yeah, we were up the whole night
               together.  We had one of those
               amazingly deep conversations, where
               you really feel like you get to know
               someone.

                         VICKY
                   (nudge, nudge)
               "Deep conversation," huh?  Is that
               what you guys call it?

                         CENTRAL GIRL
               What else would I call it?

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT

     Kevin sits on the steps into the school, depressed.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GYM - NIGHT

     The Central Girl has taken over the band's microphone.

                         CENTRAL GIRL
               Excuse me, everyone, sorry to
               interrupt.

     Her voice reverberates throughout the gym.  A couple WOLF-
     WHISTLES.

                         CENTRAL GIRL (cont'd)
               I just wanted to let you all know
               this:  Chuck Sherman is a liar.  I
               never had sex with him.  He's never
               had sex with anyone -- I know because
               he told me.  Once, he tried to screw a
               grapefruit, but that's it.  Oh, and he
               also told me that sometimes when he
               gets nervous he wets his pants.  Thank
               you for your attention.

     Girls around the gym CHEER and APPLAUD.

     ANGLE ON SHERMAN

     Pissing his pants.

     ANGLE ON JIM

     Shocked.  He looks back to Oz, who shares his expression.

     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT

     Kevin still sits there.  Jim, Oz, and Finch come out of
     the school.  Slowly they walk up to Kevin.

                         OZ
               ...Guess what?

                         KEVIN
               I don't care.

                         JIM
               Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's
               is gonna be here soon.

                         KEVIN
               I'm not going.

     A beat as the guys don't know what to say.  Kevin's
     speech is halting, downbeat.

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
               This isn't how I wanted things to turn
               out.  Making the pact wasn't just
               about getting laid.  It was about
               doing one last thing with you guys
               before we graduated.  But now I've
               just wasted my last few weeks here
               trying to do what?  I don't even know.
               All I managed to do was fuck up our
               friendship.

     A beat.  Oz shrugs.

                         OZ
               I still think you're okay.

                         JIM
               So do I, Kev.

                         FINCH
               Me too.  For the most part.

                         KEVIN
               Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I
               don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm
               acting like I've got it all together
               tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna
               ask me if I love her.  And I don't
               know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's
               like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the
               whole thing.

                         JIM
               Come on man.  Tonight is the night.
               We're finally going to a post-prom
               party on the lake.  We've been waiting
               to do this for the last four years.
               Why else are we still friends with
               Stifler?  You gotta go.

     A beat as Kevin ponders this.

                         OZ
               And by the way, Sherman didn't even
               get laid.

                         KEVIN
               He didn't?

                         FINCH
               Nope.  He pissed himself.

     The guys LAUGH as Kevin is puzzled.  THEY are suddenly
     illuminated by the glare of headlights.  A charter bus
     pulls in front of the school.

                         JIM
               There it is.  I want to grab my bag.
               Oh, and my date.

                         OZ
               Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for
               you.

     Jim holds out a helping hand.  Kevin looks at it.  Grabs
     it, and Jim pulls him up.

     EXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

     A beautiful cottage on the shore of Lake Michigan.
     Students are filing out of the charter bus.

     Jim and Michelle are walking up to the cottage.

                         JIM
               Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.

                         MICHELLE
               It reminds me of this one time --
                   (changing thoughts)
               Hey, can I ask you a question?  How
               come you don't have any stories?  I've
               got lots of stories, and you don't
               have any.

                         JIM
               Oh, I've got stories, believe me.
               They're a little more risque than
               tales of Band Camp.

                         MICHELLE
               Are they gross or something, like guy
               stuff?  Tell me.

                         JIM
               Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a
               story.  Stifler finds this beer,
               right?  And...

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM

     Kevin leads Vicky into the bedroom.  A large bay window
     overlooks moonlit Lake Michigan.

                         KEVIN
               See -- this is the nicest room.

                         VICKY
               Wow, Kev...it's perfect.

     Vicky opens a closet -- to find Stifler's Little Brother
     inside, grinning.

                         STIFLER'S BROTHER
               You guys are gonna fuck, aren't you!?

                         KEVIN
               No!  Get out of here!

                         STIFLER'S BROTHER
                   (running out of the room)
               Fuckers fuckers fuckers fuckers!

     Stiflers brother is gone.  They LAUGH...and Vicky closes
     the door.

     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     Oz and Heather are walking down the beach.  Holding
     hands.  Deep in the background, we see kids partying.

                         OZ
               There's something I've been meaning to
               tell you, Heather.

                         HEATHER
               What's that?

                         OZ
               It's gonna sound really bad, but I
               want you to know.

     She nods.  They stop walking.  Oz swipes his feet around
     in the sand.

                         OZ (cont'd)
               See, uh, I'm a virgin.  And me, Kevin,
               Jim, and Finch, we all made this pact.
               That we would...lose our virginity...
               before high school was over.

     Heather is listening.

                         OZ (cont'd)
               And, see, tonight is supposed to be
               the night we all do it.

                         HEATHER
               This isn't the best way to proposition
               me.

                         OZ
               No, that's not what I mean.  I mean --
               look.  You know what made me leave
               that game?  Coach was giving this
               speech, about not slacking off when
               you see the opportunity to score.

                         HEATHER
               This isn't any better, Chris.

                         OZ
               No, see Heather, what I realized is
               that...with you, it's not like I'm
               running towards the goal, trying to
               figure out the best way to score.  And
               this may sound corny, but --

     He takes her hand.

                         OZ (cont'd)
               I feel like I've already won.

     Heather softens, taken off guard.

                         OZ (cont'd)
               And, well, I really care about you.  A
               lot.  And I want you to know that.

                         HEATHER
               Oz, it's okay, I know.

                         OZ
               You called me Oz.

                         HEATHER
               Well, that's what your friends call
               you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of
               your friends now...and also...your
               girlfriend.

     Oz seems truly touched.

                         OZ
               Dieter.  My middle name is Dieter.

     Heather nods, and speaks pensively.

                         HEATHER
               Hmm.  You know that's
                   (cracking up)
               really a shitty middle name!

                         OZ
                   (laughing)
               I know, it sucks!

     Through their laughter, they kiss.  After a moment, it
     grows more passionate.  Lost in each other.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     The party rages in the rest of the cottage, but the
     basement is empty.  STIFLER'S MOM sits in the corner,
     smoking a cigarette.  She's as attractive as her photo we
     once saw, but the divorce has replaced her sexy smile
     with a bitter smirk.

     Finch stumbles in.

                         FINCH
               Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for
               letting us have a great party.

                         STIFLER'S MOM
                   (dry)
               As if there were any alternative
               in the matter.  Are you enjoying
               yourself?

                         FINCH
               I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!

                         STIFLER'S MOM
                   (deadpan)
               I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge
               off, doesn't it?  And where might your
               date be?

                         FINCH
               Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.

                         STIFLER'S MOM
               Pardon me?

     Finch pauses a moment.  He's got an idea.

                         FINCH
               ...Nevermind.  You have anything to
               drink?

                         STIFLER'S MOM
               I believe the kegs are upstairs.

                         FINCH
               No, no, that's what the cretins drink.
               I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.

     She considers him as she drags off her cigarette.

                         STIFLER'S MOM
               All right, I got some scotch.

                         FINCH
               Single malt?

                         STIFLER'S MOM
               Aged eighteen years.
                   (she gives him a look)
               Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind
               the bar.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - PARTY ROOM - NIGHT

     It's a great party.  Stifler is with a group of guys
     drinking a beer, which he inspects very carefully before
     every sip.

     ANGLE ON JIM AND MICHELLE

     Both drinking and talking, almost enjoying themselves.

                         MICHELLE
               That is a nasty story!

                         JIM
               I told you.

                         MICHELLE
               You wanna hear a nasty story of mine?
               It's kind of sexual.

     Ding!  A light goes off in Jim's head.

                         JIM
               Yeah, bring it on!

                         MICHELLE
               Well, this one time?  At band camp?
               We were playing this game, I don't
               know if you know it?  But it's called
               spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss
               this guy named Marc Wander on the
               lips?  And...

     Jim's expression sinks.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The lights are down.  Vicky and Kevin are in bed.

                         KEVIN
               You comfortable?

                         VICKY
               Yeah, are you?

                         KEVIN
               Yeah.

     A beat.

                         VICKY
               You sure you're comfortable?

                         KEVIN
               Yeah.  Are you sure?

                         VICKY
               Yeah.

                         KEVIN
               Me too.

                         VICKY
               Okay.
                   (a beat)
               Did you bring a condom?

                         KEVIN
               Yeah, right here.

     He pulls out a condom.  A beat as they contemplate it.

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
               So, do you want to be -- I mean, how
               do you want to do it?

                         VICKY
               I don't know.  How do you?

                         KEVIN
               Like, normal style.  The...missionary
               position.

                         VICKY
               Okay.

     A moment as they realize there's nothing left to do, but -

                         VICKY (cont'd)
               Kevin...

                         KEVIN
               Yeah Vick?

                         VICKY
               I want to hear you say it.

                         KEVIN
               Okay.

     Kevin swallows hard.  And says --

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
               Victoria...I love you.

                         VICKY
               I love you.

     They both take a deep breath.

     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     Oz and Heather lay in a secluded spot in the dunes,
     surrounded by tall beach grass that swishes in the spring
     breeze.  Stars and a lustrous moon above.

     The silence speaks.  We can see it in their eyes.
     Yearning.

                         OZ
               I can't think of anything to say
               that's not cheesy.

                         HEATHER
               Then don't.

     They kiss.  It's time.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

     A brief moment of uncertainty.  Kevin shifts around a
     bit, trying to position himself.  Vicky's hand goes under
     the sheets.

                         VICKY
               Here.

     We know what she's doing.  They both maintain eye
     contact...

     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     Heather and Oz are re-inventing the idea of passion.
     Discovering love.  This is the stuff that you thought
     only existed in romance novels.  Seriously.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - PARTY ROOM - NIGHT

     Jim is trying to stay interested in Michelle's drivel.

                         JIM
               So, the end of the story is...you had
               to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?

                         MICHELLE
               Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And
               everyone laughed at me, but I didn't
               care?  Because it was so funny!

                         JIM
                   (flat)
               Okay, I get it.

                         MICHELLE
               Oh!  And then this one time?  At band
               camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.

     Jim CHOKES on his beer.  Michelle considers her
     revelation no big deal, watching with some amusement as
     Jim struggles to recover.

                         JIM
               ...excuse me?!

                         MICHELLE
               What, you think I don't know how to
               get myself off?  Hell, that's what
               half of band camp is!  Sex ed!

     Jim is ga-ga.  He watches in disbelief as she lets her
     hair down.  And wouldn't you know it, she's pretty cute.

                         MICHELLE (cont'd)
               So are we gonna screw soon?  I'm
               getting kind of antsy.

     Jim pauses in disbelief.  Then --

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Michelle and Jim burst in and slam the door.  A toy
     basketball hoop falls off the back of the door.  They are
     standing in a cluttered, toy-strewn, pit of a kid's room.
     One of those stupid plastic airplanes on a string hangs
     from the ceiling, flying in circles.

                         JIM
               This'll do.

                         MICHELLE
               Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them
               both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't
               want you coming so damn early.

                         JIM
               Why, uh, what makes you think that I --

                         MICHELLE
               Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why
               do you think I accepted this date?
               You're a sure thing!

     Jim heartily agrees.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     The scotch bottle is almost empty.  Stifler's Mom and
     Finch are smoking cigarettes.

                         FINCH
               So...would you object if I said you're
               quite striking?

                         STIFLER'S MOM
               Mister Finch -- are you trying to
               seduce me?

                         FINCH
               Yes ma'am, I am.

     One look between them, and we know it's all over.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Kevin and Vicky.  Silently doing it.  Curious looks on
     their faces.  The look you get when your waiter delivers
     your food in a fancy restaurant, and you look at the
     creation on the plate, and secretly you're not sure if
     it's really what you ordered.  But you don't say
     anything, and you just eat it.

     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     Oz and Heather.  Souls entwined.  Making love.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     We can hear Jim and Michelle going at it like a couple of
     HOWLING BANSHEES over a SERIES OF SHOTS:

     -- A piggy bank gets knocked over and shatters.

     -- An x-wing fighter flies across the room.

     -- A pillow explodes in a cloud of feathers.

     -- One of the legs on the bed breaks.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - OUTSIDE BASEMENT DOOR - NIGHT

     The Basement door is closed.  We hear from the inside...

                         STIFLER'S MOM (O.S.)
               I had no idea you'd be this good!

                         FINCH (O.S.)
               Neither did I!

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jim and Michelle going at it.  Again, we HEAR but can't
     see them.  The room is more trashed than before.  And as
     we PAN across the disaster area they've created --

                         JIM (O.S.)
               Are you gonna do what I think you're
               gonna do?

                         MICHELLE (O.S.)
               Don't you want me to?

                         JIM (O.S.)
               Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!

                         MICHELLE (O.S.)
               Okay!

     We see her...on top of Jim.  She clears her throat.  And
     then we see her raise a children's plastic recorder to
     her lips -- and she whistles THE MICHIGAN FIGHT SONG.  On
     cue, Jim chimes in --

                         JIM
               Hail, hail, to Michigan, the leaders
               and best!

     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     Oz could be coming.  Heather could be coming.  But it's
     all so darn passionate that the whole thing looks like
     one big orgasm anyway.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jim and Michelle lay on the floor, tangled in sheets and
     each others' clothing.  Exhausted, gasping.

     And then we see the closet door is open, just a crack.
     It swings open.  Standing there is Stifler's Little
     Brother.  Jaw hanging.

                         STIFLER'S BROTHER
               That was awesome!

     Jim and Michelle are stunned.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Finch and Stifler's Mom are just off-camera.  We can't
     see it, but we can tell Finch's status from his ORGASMIC
     MOANING.

     What we do see is the kitchen door handle rattling.  The
     chair falling out of place.  And the door opening as
     Stifler walks in.  He stops, horrified.

                         STIFLER
               Ugh...oh no...

     He looks like he's going to barf.  Instead, he passes
     out.

     EXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - SUNRISE - ESTABLISHING

     The sun rises over Lake Michigan.  A brand new day.
     Various students are passed out here and there.

     EXT. BEACH - DAY

     Oz holds Heather in his arms.  Completely peaceful.
     SEAGULLS CALL to each other.  WAVES BREAK on the shore.

     Oz has lost all pretense.  Smiling to himself, or maybe
     to the world.

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Jim wakes up in bed, alone.  He looks around.

                         JIM
               She's gone.

     He considers this.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Oh my God.  She used me.

     He considers this further.  Smiles.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Wow!  I was used!  Cool!

     He jumps up and does a little dance, SINGING...

                         JIM (CONT'D)
               Hail! to the victors, valiant; Hail!
               to the conquering heroes, hail...

     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY

     Kevin and Vicky lie next to each other in bed, staring at
     the ceiling.  Though they're trying to conceal it, we can
     see a bit of dissatisfaction, uncertainty, peeking
     through.

                         KEVIN
               That was a great night.

                         VICKY
               Yeah.

     A beat.

                         KEVIN
               I can't believe we just had our senior
               prom.

                         VICKY
               Yeah, the time went by so fast.

                         KEVIN
               It did.

     Another beat.

                         VICKY
               Kevin, next year...with you in Ann
               Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not
               gonna work, is it.

                         KEVIN
               Don't say that, we can do it somehow.
               It might not be perfect, but --

                         VICKY
                   (interrupting)
               No, Kevin --
                   (she sits up)
               That's the whole thing, that's what
               I've been realizing.  That nothing's
               perfect, that you can't plan
               everything.

     Kevin thinks this over.

                         KEVIN
               It is far away...and we'll be on our
               own...meeting new people...

     A moment as they think this over.

                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
               Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.

                         VICKY
               I know.
                   (a beat)
               Let's go.  Don't you have something to
               tell your friends?

                         KEVIN
               What?

                         VICKY
               Your little pact.  Jessica told me all
               about it.
                   (hits him lightly)
               Way to go, Kev!

     Kevin gives an embarrassed smile.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     A sign on the window reads, "Congratulations Seniors!"

     INT. DOG DAYS - DAY

     The four, newly non-virgins munch on hot dogs.  Kevin's
     LAUGHING.

                   (to Jim)
               I guess we'll call you two-ply.

                         OZ
               Yeah.  So you want double condiments
               on that?

                         JIM
               No, no that's fine.
                   (then, to Kevin)
               So you doing okay?

                         KEVIN
                   (a wistful smile)
               Yeah.

                         FINCH
               I'll tell you, I've learned one thing:
               women, like wine, get better with age.
                   (a beat)
               Of course, I have no frame of
               reference for this comparison.

                         KEVIN
               So Oz, you almost made it, huh?

                   (smiles)
               I'll just say that we had a great
               night together.

                         JIM
               Hang in there, buddy, you'll get
               there.

                         OZ
               I know.

               Wow.  You two really have something
               going, don't you?

                         OZ
               I think we're falling in love.

     They GROAN.  Oz just smiles.

               You know what the coolest thing is?
               This, right now.

     They guys keep eating, uncertain what to say.

                         OZ
               It's true.  I mean, after this,
               everything'll be different.

                         JIM
               After getting laid?

                         OZ
               After high school.

                         KEVIN
               Yeah, but we'll still see each other.

                         OZ
               Fuck yeah we will.

     A beat.  Kevin raises his Pepsi.

     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BACK OF LIBRARY - DAY

     Kevin arrives in the back of the library.  Kneels down to

               Um...I'm sort of wondering
               about...love.

     We hear Kevin's Brother CHUCKLE knowingly.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)
               That's the next book, Kevin.  That's
               the next book.

     He puts the bible back without the reverence he once had
     for it.  Stands up with some new confidence.  We FOLLOW

     INT. A HOTEL HALLWAY

     SUPER:  "PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC"

     A WAITER ascends a beautiful, red-carpeted staircase,
     carrying a tray with bottle of champagne and a rose.  He
     arrives in front of a hotel door.  KNOCKS.  A BELLBOY
     passes by, noticing the waiter.  And HE SPEAKS TO HIM IN
     AUTHENTIC, THICK CZECH.

                         BELLBOY
                   (subtitled)
               Another bottle?

                   (subtitled)
               He knows how to treat a woman.

     The door opens -- to reveal Jim, sweaty but not the least
     bit tired, tying on a robe.

                         JIM
               Thanks guys.

     A pair of arms wraps around him from behind.  And --
     Nadia peeks her head over Jim's shoulder.

                         NADIA
               Come back to bed, James.

     Jim smiles to the guys and takes the tray, as Nadia pulls
     him back in and closes the door.

                         WAITER
                   (subtitled)
               That is one lucky man.

               Funny -- I swear I have seen those two
               somewhere before.  The boy is some
               sort of dancer.

     They head off.

A very grand room, with lots of wood and some very famous portraits round the
walls.

A group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen. They are the trustees of the
National Gallery. LORD WALTON, a very grand man, sits at the table head. To
his right sits his assistant, GARETH. All are deep in thought. LORD WALTON
fidgets with a pencil on the table. He raises his head as though about to
speak. Everyone looks up expectantly. And... LORD WALTON goes back to
fidgeting. So does everyone else.

EXT.   MR BEAN'S STREET.     DAY

Mr BEAN comes out of his house, ready to face the world-

He walks up the street, tutting slightly at     a 'NO PARKING' sign he passes.
The street is totally car-free except for a     very visible lime green mini. A
policeman strolls by and glances down at a     pair of legs sticking out from
under it, next to a toolbox. He moves on,      satisfied that someone is mending
their car.

BEAN approaches the car     and whips out the fake legs he left there. He then
unlocks the big padlock     that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside,
fiddles with something     else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening
speed with a smug look     on his face.

The Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits.

BEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if
it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound
fault.

BEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen ~ he goes at them at quite a
lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps
violently.

BEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the
problem. Instead of having a car radio, BEAN has an old record player
strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune.

On he drives, through empty streets - then JOLT - he's reached the glorious
familiarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful
traffic.

Heels not happy. He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. He
takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight-
line-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. He 'S

satisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley. It is such a
perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls.

But at the end of      the alley, the traffic's just as bad.     BEAN    notices he's
outside Harrods.       There's a tail-coated Security Guard at    the    'front door.
BEAN watches him      stroll a bit down the street - and takes    his    chance. He
turns and drives      straight through the double doors, into    the    store.

                                                                                            2


INT.    HARRODS.   DAY.

BEAN and his car whizz through the ground floor, past perfume counters and
leather glove racks.

CUT TO a Security Guard. As       he passes one of the counters, BEAN's little car
just shoots behind him. The       Guard continues through the Children's section
there are giant elephants and      teddies, children's size cars, then two huge
plastic tractors - and then,      stock still, strangely in harmony actually, the
Lime Green Mini with BEAN in      it. The Guard walks straight past.

The moment he is gone, BEAN shoots off again - but, damn!, spies another Guard
and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed. The theme
song goes CRAZY as the record player jumps.

                                                                                 CUT TO:

6 people waiting at a gilded lift. They hear a strange sound, and turn to see
what it is. In fact, it's coming from inside the lift. When the lift doors
open, out shoots the Mini through the double doors and back into the street.

                                                                                        3


EXT.    KNIGHTSBRIDGE.     DAY.

Out in the street, BEAN is faced by an accident. There are flashing lights, a
crumpled car, suggestions of hurt passengers. BEAN looks concerned.

                                                                                 CUT TO:
EXT.    THE STRAND.     DAY.

An Ambulance roars through the traffic. It reaches its hospital, turns off,
and there, right smack behind it is the Mini. Cut in to see BEAN, smiling
broadly. He whizzes into Trafalgar Square, maybe even across it, sending
pigeons and tourists flying, and parks directly outside the statuesque
National Gallery. Of course, there's not another car there. Just the Gallery
and the mini.

                                                                                 CUT TO:

EXT.    NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

BEAN    gets out of the car, takes out his bag - thinks a little, opens it and
takes    out a "Doctor on Call' sign. To re-enforce it, he puts a bone in the
back    window and a skull of the front seat. Happy with the arrangement, he re-
locks    the padlock and sets off smiling up the big, stairs to work.

As he does so, pan up the building, and into the window of the room where that
Board meeting was taking place.

                                                                       CUT TO:

A glimmer of hope.



INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    PORTRAIT SECTION - DAY

BEAN wanders past three or four portraits and mimics the characters in them.
He passes a guard.

                                        GUARD
                           (not looking up from his book)
                     Morning, Bean.

The GUARD sighs with boredom. He gets this from BEAN every day. As Bean
moves on, he treads on the heel of a tourist's shoe. It comes off- BEAN moves
on blithely.

                                                                       CUT TO:

INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CARTOON ROOM ENTRANCE - DAY

BEAN is passing the very special room where Leonardo Da Vinci's cartoon, 'The
Virgin and Child', hangs, preserved by a very dim artificial light. There are
silhouettes of a few tourists in the room reverently studying the work,
listening to a female GALLERY GUIDE.

BEAN dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing brings out a
coin. The coin drops and rolls into the special room. BEAN follows it into
the darkness.

                                   GALLERY GUIDE

                                    (hushed)
                   ... by Leonardo Da Vinci. As you can see, the special light
                   in here goes some way to protect the drawing from
                   photodisintegration caused by gamma ...

The camera stays outside the room with the picture in view. We hear the
squeak of a tiny door open, then a click. The room is suddenly flooded in
blazing white light. The onlookers gasp in horror.

                                                                               5

BEAN re-emerges from the room with his precious coin. As an afterthought he
pops his hand round the doorway and turns off the light. He scuttles away.
The GALLERY GUIDE shakes her head in total exasperation.
                                                                      CUT TO:

             and move the entire National Gallery somewhere else. And not tell

             All those in favour.

They all raise their hands wildly.

                                     LORD WALTON
                           Come on - settle down everyone.
                                                                            CUT TO:
INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    ELEVATOR - DAY

BEAN stands in the elevator silently with four other       people. He gives himself
a long squirt of breathfreshener. Then offers it to        the others, who politely
refuse him. So he stands still again. Pause. BEAN          then smells something
unpleasant. He leans and has a little sniff of the        person to his left. All
right there. Then he sniffs to his right, and reels        at what he smells. He
again takes out the breath freshener, and forces it       upon VINCENT, an elderly
gentleman, who is mortified.

At this moment the elevator stops - BEAN and VINCENT get out and the camera
follows VINCENT as he heads for the boardroom door and enters. He is another
trustee. This dialogue is heard from behind the closed door.

                                    VINCENT
                   I'm sorry I'm late.

                                    VINCENT

INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CORRIDOR - DAY

BEAN, with cup of tea, walks along a corridor. He can't not interfere for
tidiness sake. One empty room he switches off the light. Another he shuts
the door.

He passes a computer room, with an open door where a big man is busily typing
in a programme - BEAN looks at him snootily and heads on.

He approaches the door to his office. A sign reads: 'STORAGE & CATALOGUE'.
There is a huge padlock on the door. BEAN takes out a big key and enters his
domain.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    STORAGE OFFICE - DAY.

BEAN enters. He's been here for years and made it his own. It's an odd
little world. There's a framed picture of Shirley Bassey on his desk and
Airfix planes hang from the ceiling. Also a large cosy armchair and a T.V.

A pleasant Man in a suit, around 40, breezes in.

                                    SUIT MAN
             Ah Bean, I'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht.    Still Life.
             Circa 1670. Can do?

BEAN nods. This is what BEAN likes to do best. The camera follows as he
turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him...

His office is just a tiny    corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet
high and long, the walls    completely full of rack after rack of stored
paintings. At the end of     the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts,
modern abstracts, men on    horses, classical maidens, Rodins, the lot. It's
like the giant storehouse    at the end of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.

                                                                                7

BEAN sets off into it in his own eccentric way. He knows exactly where heels
going. He climbs a ladder, like you find in a library - then pushes himself
off, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners.

He has now reached the sculpture area, but    the painting heels looking for is
on the other side. He crosses the room by     using the sculptures as a kind of
artistic obstacle course. In front of him     is the Burghers of Calais, a Rodin
statue of 5 prisoners in chains. He simply     walks across their 5 heads, like
stones in a stream.

He then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as    a slide   and at the
end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern    thing.    He then
begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the    mouths   as
footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty    eyes as   finger
holes.

After a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he
walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic
sculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina, one step on to
the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse,
three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall.

He then triumphantly pulls out a painting.     It's the one!,

                                     SUIT MAN
              What would we do without you! The entire inventory of British Art
              stored in that one, curious brain of yours.

BEAN beams.

              Very well.   Mr Bean is.... art history.    We can all stop taking
              the pills.

A reserved smatter of laughter, from relief more than anything.      LORD W. talks
into an intercom on the table.

                                   LORD WALTON
              Miss Hutchinson, would you send Mr. Bean up to the boardroom,
              please.

                                  MISS HUTCHINSON
                                       (V/O )

              Yes sir. oh, and Lord Walton, the Grierson Gallery called again.

                                   LORD WALTON
              Thank you. (To the room) One final thing. Once again we have been
              invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to second
              one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly
              modest collection - but it does include the most famous American
              painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'. Any thoughts?

Cut to the trustees - they shake their heads and wrinkle, their noses, not
very interested. A 106 year old SIR RUPERT puts up his hand.

                                   LORD WALTON
              Yes. Sir Rupert. And may I say sir, how honoured we are that you
              still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and infinite knowledge.
              Your invaluable thoughts, sir?

                                    SIR RUPERT
              Could you speak up please. I didn't catch the question.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      STORAGE OFFICE - DAY

Back in his office area BEAN ceremoniously hands SUIT MAN the Van Hocht
painting. He's very proud of himself.

                                          SUIT MAN
               Thank you, Bean.      You're a genius.

                                                                                      9

BEAN laughs - delighted.         SUIT MAN exits and MISS HUTCHINSON enters, warily.

                                     MISS HUTCHINSON
               Mr. Bean.     Lord Walton would like to see you in the boardroom.

BEAN gives a little pleasured squeak.             How exciting for him.   He follows MISS
HUTCHINSON out into the corridor.

                                                                                  CUT TO:
INT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      CORRIDOR.   DAY

BEAN    walks along    the same corridor as before. Turns off another light. Then
comes    to the room    where he saw the Programmer. The computer, showing a Van
Gogh    portrait, is    on and no-one's there. BEAN, who hates wasted electricity,
goes    in to switch    it off.

We see the Van Gogh change to a pictorial representation of the Storage room -
with an arrow pointing to where the Van Gogh is located. BEAN is clearly
going to be replaced by this programme. Or not ... BEAN searches for the
plug, but it's under acres of desk - so he simply pulls a cable out of the
back the computer. The entire system clicks off. At which moment the
Programmer comes back in.

                                       PROGRAMMER
                       What's happening here?

                                            BEAN
                       Ahm...

With a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement
at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess. And
a disastrous one. There is a ugly electrical fizzle. The screens come on
white, then pop out completely.

                                            BEAN
                       Ah.... Ahm....

BEAN realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable
into another circuit. The Van Gogh appears happily on the screen. BEAN and
PROGRAMMER both give out a sigh of relief. BEAN smiles and leaves quickly.
But a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the Van Gogh slides
down the screen like a water-colour in the rain. The PROG difficult to
breathe.

                                                                                          10

               You have your voting slips, gentlemen.          Please remember the

             Americans are looking for something quite high powered.     A
             doctorate preferably...

There is a knock at the door. BEAN enters. LORD WALTON smiles. The rest of
the faces in the room are looking dangerously close to smug. BEAN is very
nervous indeed.

                                  LORD WALTON
                                   (gravely)
             Ah, Mr. Bean. Please take a seat for a moment.      I have some news
             which will not, I'm afraid...

The phone rings. LORD WALTON answers. BEAN sits next to VINCENT and sniffs
at him. VINCENT's breath hasn't improved.

                                      LORD WALTON
                                     (into phone)
             Yes?     Put him on... Timothy. The computer ... Yes... When? How?
             All    of it? Absolutely all of it? Did you back it up? How long
             will    it ... ? Another six months. Fair enough. Come up here
             will    you, dear boy.

He slowly hangs up. Everyone has got the gist of what has just occurred with
the new computer- The energy drains from them all as they contemplate another
six months with BEAN still on the staff. LORD WALTON coughs politely.

                                  LORD WALTON
             As I was saying, gentlemen. The Grierson Gallery. South
             California. Great opportunity. Thousands-of miles-away though it
             is. Doctorate or ( IMPISHLY ) no doctorate, perhaps

All get the message at the same moment and hurriedly scribble on their voting
slips. The slips get handed down the line to LORD WALTON. We see that every
single slip has 'BEAN' on it.

                                     LORD WALTON
             Mr. Bean.     Wonderful news. You are going to America.

                                       MR. BEAN
                                    (overwhelmed)
             Ooooh, how lovely.

There is a knock at the door. The fat, bespectacled,
PROGRAMMER puts his head round it.

                                    LORD WALTON
                                     (beaming)
             Ah, Timothy.    You're sacked.

                                                                             CUT TO:


INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CORRIDOR - DAY

BEAN rounds a corner and walks     towards us, imitating a bowlegged cowboy. The
Theme from Bonanza plays. He      whips out his pair of imaginary six shooters,
spins them on his fingers and     returns them to-their imaginary holsters, making
gun sound effects. He's very      happy.-He passes the Security Guard - he draws
his gun on him - zero reaction     the Guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns.

BEAN heads on through the gallery merrily - but suddenly, his good mood is

broken, when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition, called The
Ultra-Human Form. This worries him - and we soon see why - BEAN heads in to
the room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes, and the 3 girls are
having a good giggle.

BEAN quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the painting
they're inspecting.

Two girls then move on to the next painting - which unfortunately also has
breasts. BEAN stretches and just manages to cover them with his other hand.

Now the third girl    heads on, so BEAN can drop the hand on the first painting -
but now has to try    to cover the breasts on the third painting, which is a real
long stretch away.     He can't quite make it, so he takes off his shoes, which
gives him the extra    3 inches. Again, safe. Just.

Now, all three girls leave the paintings - but, to BEAN's chagrin, head over
to a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room. It's like the 3
Graces, 3 naked women back to back. BEAN thinks fast. He quickly whips off
his

                                                                              12

Belt and rushes over to the statue, where he succeeds in looping it round to
cover all six nipples.

Unfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to the other
side of the gallery. To BEAN's horror. Because at that moment we reveal what
is on the other side of the room. A epic painting in the style of the others
- with literally 40 graphically naked people.

BEAN sprints across the room, stands on a chair, and desperately tries to
cover a particularly lurid example of a gentleman's manhood.

At which    moment the teacher of the party and 40 other schoolgirls appear and
scream in    chorus. BEAN thinks that it is the painting that has caused offence
and is in    outraged agreement with them. He turns. Cut wide to reveal that
they are    screaming because he's beltless
trousers    have fallen down.
                                                                          CUT TO:

EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.     AMERICA - DAY.

8.30 am California time. A modern building with plenty of glass. Large,
modern sculptures are spotted around its grounds, including a dramatic one of
two huge old cars, head down in the ground, backs protruding into the air.

THOMAS GRIERSON, owner of the gallery, wearing a slick expensive suit, walks
with DAVE LEARY and BERNIE, both in casual jackets and ties. GRIERSON is a
vain, slightly pedantic and pompous man - maybe short - always just trying to
show he's Boss. The three are strolling towards the main entrance. Huge
sign: 'THE GRIERSON GALLERY' with a silhouette of Whistler's Mother taken from
the painting, as an incorporated logo.

                                      GRIERSON
               Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in
               the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less.

                                       BERNIE
               Great news.

BERNIE is smooth and smiley. DAVID LEARY, Vice President, is a very pleasant,
but slightly worried man, knocking on 40. Too nice for his own good. The
three pass a lone MIME ARTIST wearing a cheap vac-form PRESIDENT CLINTON face
mask. David can't help being just a little nice to him and finds himself left
behind. He scampers to catch up.

                                                                                   9
First, catching under the handle - then the couch, then

Four other chairs - and finally the deep freeze.        No-one's going to get in
through that door.

BACK IN THE    HALL BEAN pushes the string    back inside the    letter box and slaps
his hand in    satisfaction. He locks the     door's enormous    padlock, looks about
carefully to    make sure no one's around,    and then hides    the key under a garden
gnome on the    floor, standing amongst a    row of pathetic    pot plants.

                                                            MIX THROUGH TO:
INT.    AIRPORT.   RECEPTION DESK.   NIGHT

The lady checking in BEAN looks puzzled as she holds his passport. So he
pulls the shockingly stupid face. 0h yes, she sees, that's the guy in the
picture. She hands him his ticket.

                                   CHECK-IN LADY
                Here we go, sir. You've been moved to l st. class. Apparently
                your friends at the Gallery were so delighted that you're
                finally on your way.

 BEAN is very touched.

                                                                               CUT TO:

 INT.    AIRPORT LOUNGE - NIGHT

 BEAN enters the first class lounge. It's fairly empty, but BEAN still
 squeezes himself between an old lady drinking a cup of tea, and a very grand
 looking American military man in a business suit.

 The Grand Man lights up a cigar. This doesn't please Mr "No Smoking BEAN.
 First, he waves the smoke away, in small, then big, then huge wafting
 motions. Then he tries, miming, to cut it up into segments and move them
 aside. The man pays no attention at all.

 BEAN puts a plastic mug over his face, like a gas mask and breathes heavily.
 The man looks at him - but doesn't give a damn

 BEAN now takes a paper bag - catches some of the smoke, and take it over and
 empties it into the dust bin.

 The Grand Man goes on smoking stubbornly.        He then sees a magazine rack and
 leaves his cigar as he goes to get one.

                                                                                       13

                                        DAVID

               Sounds like a real coup, sir... getting this Doctor of ...


                                      GRIERSON

            Various things. Thank you. However, as you know, this is not an
            inexpensive venture, and, financially speaking, we're in very
            serious crap right now.

 He can't quite hide his tackiness.) DAVID holds the door for GRIERSON - then
 sees an old woman coming towards him. He waits for her to go through, and
 due to his sweetness, is again left behind. He rushes to catch up.

They are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop. DAVID exchanges
smiles with the cashier, ANNIE. Very bubbly, not very bright. The shop is
full of Whistler's Mother memorabilia - posters, cards, porcelain statuettes.

                                    GRIERSON
            So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your
            home instead of some expensive hotel.

                                     BERNIE
            Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room.   Period.

                                        GRIERSON
            David?

                                      DAVID
            Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really
            like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't
            really er ...

                                    GRIERSON
            I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate
            attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial
            LOSS ...

                                      DAVID
              on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my
              family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course
              it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due?

GRIERSON hands DAVID a piece of paper.

                                      GRIERSON
              Tomorrow.   You have a problem with that?

PAUSE

                                       DAVID
              No. Perfect.   Looking forward to it.
                                                                        CUT TO:


INT.    LONDON . PHOTO BOOTH.    DAY.

The camera faces Mr BEAN sitting in a Photo booth. His face is totally
impassive for 1, 2, then 3 flashes. And then, just before the 4th flash, he
pulls the biggest, maddest face you've ever seen. Flash! He gives a little

Satisfied giggle.

                                                                        CUT TO:


 EXT.    THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY

 7 p.m. California time. A pleasant suburban house. DAVID's car pulls into
 the drive. JENNIFER, his slightly Gothic 16 year old daughter, is kissing
 BRAD, her scruffy boyfriend. He sits astride a motor scooter. He has a
 bum-fluff moustache.

 DAVID gets out of his car and approaches them.


                                   DAVID
            Hi, Jennifer. How was school? (she doesn't break the kiss with
            Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some
            more.

 The two continue kissing as DAVID moves on. He's just about to head for the
 house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb. DAVID's wife, ALISON,
 has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss, CHARLES. They are
 laughing in the car as DAVID walks up.

                                                                               15

He is slightly disturbed to see ALISON kiss CHARLES on the cheek before
getting out with her port folio. CHARLES smiles pleasantly on seeing DAVID.

                                      CHARLES
            Hello, David.

                                    DAVID
            Hi, Charles. (To Alison) Wow - late!

                                    ALISON
                                  (brightly)
            I had to do some last minute stuff.

                                  CHARLES
            My fault. We've got a heavy load on at present.     How about you,
            gallery going well?

                                    DAVID
            Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I
            think it ....

                                    ALISON
            Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.

Alison is the same age as DAVID, but seems to have lasted the course better -
she's confident, in good shape. The atmosphere is awkward. JENNIFER screams
out. Her 8 year old brother, KEVIN has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed
her and BRAD. ALISON goes over to sort them out.

                                     ALISON
            Kevin!   You stop that right now!

                                      CHARLES
            Great kids.     Good looking too.

                                      DAVID
            You think so?    Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know... okay,
            looks-wise.

                                      CHARLES

            Take after their mother, huh?

                                       DAVID
            Ah ... absolutely.

DAVID is not very happy here.

                                                                               16

 INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   KITCHEN - DAY

It is open plan and leads through into the lounge. DAVID and ALISON enter.
ALISON puts her port folio on the table and leads DAVID onto a sofa. She puts
her arms round him.


                                    ALISON
            Let's take a break, David. This weekend, why don't we just get
            into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel. Like before
            the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another Bambi.

She reaches across and picks up a little ceramic Bambi on a table next to the
couch.

                                    ALISON
            Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin

                                    DAVID
            Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's
            coming to work at the Gallery, from England...

                                       ALISON
                                  (SUSPICIOUSLY)
                                      Yeeees?

                                    DAVID
            And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a
            while.

                                      ALISON
            There aren't hotels?

                                    DAVID
            Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for
            him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all
            that stuff.

                                       ALISON
                                    (POINTEDLY)
            And what did you say?

                                    DAVID
            I said I'd check with you.

She looks at him piercingly.     This clearly happens a lot.   She knows when he's
telling the truth. Pause.

                                       DAVID
            Then I said 'yes'.

She puts Bambi carefully back on the table, gets up and moves to the kitchen.
DAVID follows.

                                      ALISON
              Do we know anything about him?

                                     DAVID
              Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ...      at least
              2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a     blind
              dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all     the
              time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal     here.

                                      ALISON
              David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?

                                       DAVID
              Yes.   Yes. (pause) Sometime.

 She shakes her head.

                                      ALISON
              It's the last thing we need.

                                      DAVID
              That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a
              sensational idea."

He knows he's made a mess here.       Enter KEVIN, their smart young son, strolling
through.

                                      KEVIN
              Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....
              (checks watch) oh, 20 minutes.

                                        DAVID
                                    Great, good.

And KEVIN exits.

                                                                                  18

                                      DAVID
               Didn't kids do their own homework, like way back?     Years ago?
               No. Course not. Just imagining it.

 ALISON isn't really listening.       Much tension.

                                                                           CUT TO:

EXT.   MR.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - NIGHT

9.30 p.m. U.K. time. A black London taxi is parked outside a terraced house
with its motor idling. Its driver looks fed up waiting. BEAN appears at a
downstairs window, motioning to his watch that he will not be long.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   MR.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - DAY

MR. BEAN is ready to leave his room.       Battered old

suitcase in hand, he checks the room from the doorway.

Every conceivable thing that can be opened - cupboards,

drawers, fridge -sports an oversized padlock.    Even

Bean's old G.P.O. phone has one on its dial.

BEAN looks across to his TEDDY, who is lounging on a miniature chair, inside
an up-sided cardboard box. The box is sits on an armchair. A hand-written
sign, taped to its roof reads: 'TEDDY HOTEL' followed by three stars.
                                                                            19

A smaller sign informs us that the hotel is: 'FULL'. BEAN is just about to
leave but stops to consider. Taking a felt tipped pen, he adds two more stars
on the hotel hoarding, as a treat.

He then, slightly, incomprehensibly, begins to tie string it around various
objects in the flat. The fridge - the corner of a chair, a couch leg.

                                                                        CUT TO:

INT.   MR.   BEAN'S RESIDENCE'S HALLWAY ~ DAY

BEAN leaves his flat. lee notice a large official sign stuck on the door
saying 'NO SMOKING". He now turns his attention to the pieces of string
hanging out the letter box in his door. Grabbing the bunch of them, he pulls.

CUT TO back inside the flat. we now understand the string - as all the
furniture starts to move across the flat. It works incredibly neatly the
chair reaches the door

                                                                               20

BEAN acts fast.    He takes the cigar - and quickly dunks it in the old woman's
cup of tea.

He sits there, guiltlessly, as the Grand Man returns. Simultaneously, the man
tries to suck the wet cigar, and the Old woman drinks the disgusting tea. A
horrid experience for both.

                                                                        CUT TO:


INT.   AEROPLANE - DAY.

Boarding time. BEAN enters the plane and turns    right, into the body of the
plane. After walking right down the plane, he    is directed by a hostess back
up to first. As he walks back, we notice the'    ridiculous contrast, from
totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of   children and muzak, to the
elegance, and space of First class.

BEAN couldn't be more thrilled.    There follows a sequence of short moments
from this nightmare flight.

1/ The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her ,luggage.    A hostess
slides it into the compartment above her head.

                                      OLD LADY
               Be careful.   It's for my Grand-daughter.

The next instant BEAN comes up with his case. He opens the     same locker, and
tries to fit his case in. Doesn't quite go - so he pushes     it violently. We
hear crunching cracking sounds. Finally, it's almost there     - BEAN slams the
locker door. One final definitive, though muffled, smash.      The OLD LADY looks
at BEAN suspiciously.

2/ BEAN sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour? The Grand Man,
whose name is REYNOLDS. BEAN smiles merrily. The affection is not mutual.

Champagne comes    round instantly. BEAN takes it, along with a small bowl of
nuts, and clinks    glasses with his unsmiling partner. BEAN tries to impress
him by throwing    nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well
practised art).     No response.

BEAN then switches on the noisy overhead air blower. Then can't turn it down
again. It's very stuck. He manages however to push it away from his face -
straight into REYNOLDS' . REYNOLDS looks annoyed, BEAN guiltless.

                                                                                 21

Then 'BEAN has an idea. He takes a tissue out of his pocket, puts in his
mouth, chews it into a spitball

And rams it into the blower. Both of them are relieved. REYNOLDS picks up
his champagne to have his first proper sip. And whapp! The spitball, under
high pressure, shoots

into it, sending champagne spraying all over REYNOLDS.     Not a good start.


3/--BEAN is reading the in-flight magazine. There's an annoying sound. He
looks sideways - it is the headphones of the YOUNG BOY in the seat across the
aisle. He's fallen asleep with his headphones on. BEAN looks annoyed. Then
suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he
carries. He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on purpose
simply cuts the wire of the boy's headset. That's better.

4/ Night. Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool of
light. It's Mr BEAN still up, reading.

But even he is   wilting. His eyes close, and his body starts to waver towards
sleep. Next to    him, REYNOLDS is in a total lying position - and
unfortunately,   as BEAN slowly tips over, his mouth comes into direct contact
with REYNOLDS'   flies.

From across the compartment, a hostess sees what's happening. She's shocked,
comes over and taps BEAN on the ,,shoulder. He shoots up, and nearly
strangles her in shock. She calms him down, shows him how to put his chair
back - and leaves him to sleep. CUT ON....

5/ REYNOLDS still asleep. With BEAN asleep completely on top of him.
Completely. His hand is spread on REYNOLDS' face. REYNOLDS' eyes open.         He
sees what's happened. His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess.

6/ Morning has broken. REYNOLDS is still trying to sleep - BEAN is wide
awake. The Hostess approaches, and the MOTHER of the YOUNG BOY says her son
isn't very well.

BEAN decides to cheer him up. He mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel
more ill. Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of
paper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them.

He then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his trick of
throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth. The boy is too ill
to be impressed.

BEAN tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy
and then a tough American Cop. Nothing. Then he has an extremely fun idea.
He empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them.

                                                                                22

He then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake REYNOLDS, when
he sees it's got a hole in it. No fun.

Meanwhile, the Boy has taken out his sick-bag. BEAN is delighted - yes,
that's perfect. He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless
bag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag. BEAN turns, grabs the
bag from him - blows into it, puts it right into REYNOLDS' face at arms
length, and smacks his hands together. CUT at just the right moment.

                                                                        CUT TO:

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.     ARRIVALS - NIGHT

The traditional exit area. A random bunch of people are waiting - relatives,
limousine drivers - and, rather strangely, three 30 year old women dressed in
curly red wigs from the musical, 'Annie'.

The LEARYS are at the barrier. KEVIN has a cardboard sign with 'MR. BEAN'
written on it. People are streaming out of the Arrivals gate. ALISON is not
happy. Actually no one is. JENNIFER looks particularly fed up.

                                        DAVID

             For all you know, he may be a very attractive young man.

                                    JENNIFER
             Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.   All Englishmen are
             ugly.

                                        DAVID
What makes you say that?

                                   JENNIFER
           All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan
           Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony
           Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two
           million bucks a year to stay indoors.

                                     DAVID
             Richard Burton was very good-looking.

                                     JENNIFER
             Welsh again.

                                     DAVID
             Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.    No-one's
             asking you to go to bed with him.

JENNIFER glares at him.     A tired ALISON has had enough of this waiting
already.

                                       ALISON
             Bed sounds good though.    Bed sounds great.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.    CONVEYER - NIGHT

BEAN, is off the plane. REYNOLDS strides ahead of him, a huge wet patch in a
semi-circle around his neck. BEAN comes to a moving walkways. He steps on to
it sheepishly, thinking it's very daring and brave, gripping the handrail as
though he was travelling at 100 mph.

But soon he gains greater confidence. He stands up straight, both hands off
the rail. There are a couple of COPS leaning against a wall, chatting. BEAN
notices their guns. Slipping into role-play mode, he reaches into his breast
pocket, ready to bring out his imaginary shooter ... The last security guard
he tried this with just yawned ~ so BEAN thinks it's safe. But this time, the
COPS turn and stare at him tensely..

Flustered by their interest in him, BEAN needs to get away. He turns,        but
finds that he is walking in the opposite direction, on the spot. The        COPS
read this as suspicious behaviour and move towards him suspiciously.        BEAN
turns to gets himself going in the right direction. The COPS follow.         BEAN
runs. The COPS give chase.

                                                                            CUT TO:

A little BALD MAN arrives at the barrier. The three red wigged clones from
the musical, `Annie' swamp him with shrieks and kisses. The LEARYS are
getting impatient.

                                    (bored )
             Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.

                                     DAVID
             Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.

                                       KEVIN
             I vote for Bart.

             Shut up, Kevin.

                                     KEVIN
          NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something
          about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you think it is, Dad?
          Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11
          mosquitoes, resting.

                                   JENNIFER
          You know the thing I hate most about children?

                                      KEVIN
          Nope.

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.   CORRIDOR - NIGHT

BEAN is running down the busy corridor with the two COPS in pursuit.      They
draw their guns. Two more COPS appear,

coming from the opposite direction.    BEAN is trapped.    He drops his case.

                                       COP 1
                           Police!   Stop or we shoot!

                                                                                 25

Passers-by scream and throw themselves to the floor. BEAN freezes on the
spot, terrified. All four COPS have their guns trained on him in the shooting
position.

                                     COP 1
             Carefully take out your weapon, holding the butt with two fingers
             only. Slowly place it on the floor and take three paces back!

Dead slowly, BEAN puts his hand into his inside jacket pocket and brings it
back out made in the shape of a gun. He slowly transfers that imaginary item
to the finger and thumb of his left hand. He bends down and places it on the
floor then takes three paces back. He gives out a big breath after the effort
of it all. The COPS just stare at him, gob-smacked.

Little OLD LADY from plane steers up from nowhere. She rattles her box of
broken china and kicks BEAN in the shins. Things are not going his way.

                                                                           CUT TO:

Bright and clinical. Close on BEAN sitting behind a       table; a very small man
in very big trouble. Behind him, two uniformed COPS       stand guard. A large,
black plain clothes detective sits opposite, smoking      a cigarette. This is
BRUTUS. He studies BEAN's passport photo. It's the        baboon face. He holds it
up to bean's face to make a comparison. BEAN pulls       the face to match the
photo.

                                     BRUTUS
             Mr. Bean. Are you presently on any kind of medication at all?

BEAN thinks deeply for a moment then shakes his head.

                                     BRUTUS
             You could certainly use some.

             I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...

             What's wrong with you, David? All you have to do is say, Excuse
             me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and
             I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
             I'll go.

              I said, I'11 go.

 She goes. KEVIN shakes his head disappointedly al,-- his father. DAVID
 slumps down on the seat. He overhears JENNIFER flirting with an incredibly
 undesirable bloke in a leather jacket - white, with Rasta hair extensions,
 and about sixty rings in his nose. (This is STINGO).

                                    JENNIFER
             So. where do your parents live?

                                     STINGO
             My parents are dead.

 DAVID is pretty confident that he knows who killed them.

             Yeah, so are mine.

He slams the door and the taxi drives away.

The taxi draws up outside the house.      BEAN gets out with his case.   The CAB
DRIVER is strangely friendly.

             Thanks man, I can't tell you how much I appreciate talking to ya.
             In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya,
             with their stupid problems ... But you, you're a great listener,
             ya know that?

BEAN smiles politely. Taxi drives away. BEAN walks up to' the front porch,
checks the house number on his piece of paper and presses the doorbell. No
answer. Presses again. Still no answer ... Now where have they hidden the
key. He inspects things carefully.

The camera sees what he sees ... the     doormat, the flowerpot, the window-ledge
... and then he spots a little stone     frog. BEAN smiles. Key hiding is
something he knows about - and people     are pathetically obvious about it. BEAN
picks up the FROG to reveal the front     door key. It glints in the porch-light.

                                                                           CUT TO:

Close-up of flashing L.E.D. Again, BEAN looks carefully and finds the magnetic
box, housing a little key, attached to the underside of the console. Just as
the alarm goes off, for the splittest of a secondette, he turns the key in its
slot ... and is safe.

BEAN finds the switch and turns on the hall light. He switches it off again
... then on. Then rapidly clicks it on and off repeatedly.Fun.

 Pause. DAVID's now heard it completely. He takes his eyes off the road and
 stares at ALISON a moment too long. A car's horn snatches back his
 attention.

                                          DAVID

                But in general ... it's ... mostly me, right?

Pause.     Single shot of Alison and David.       She doesn't answer.   He is

destitute.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   HALLWAY - NIGHT

BEAN wanders down the stairs in his pyjamas. He sees a walkman - and puts it
on happily. He moves to the rhythm. He locks the door, turns on the alarm
and turns off the
hall light.

                                                                         CUT TO:
EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

DAVID's car turns into the drive just as the hall light goes off. (For the
next few minutes, knife-edged timing 0 is all). The LEARYS sleepily get out
of the car and approach the house. DAVID brings out his door key.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT

The exact moment the key turns in the lock, BEAN, still wearing headphones,
disappears into a bedroom with a little ceramic sign on it saying: 'GUEST
ROOM'.

The exhausted family enter an apparently untouched house. KEVIN turns on the
stairs light, climbs to his room off the landing and closes the door on which
a sign reads: 'KEVIN'.

                                                                              30

At that instant BEAN walks out, looking for the bathroom with his wash bag.
He looks up at the light. It should not be on. He frowns, turns it off and
exits to bathroom. At which precise moment JENNIFER, zombie-like, is halfway
up the stairs

                                     JENNIFER
             Thanks a lot, Kevin!

JENNIFER goes into her room.     The sign reads: `JENNIFER'.

ALISON turns on the light and climbs the stairs. David heads into the
kitchen. They exchange a sad look. She goes into their bedroom: the sign
reads: 'GRUPS'. At which instant, BEAN, still wearing headphones, leaves the
bathroom, and heads downstairs ....

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   KITCHEN - NIGHT

The light is on. DAVID takes a deep breath. Bad night. He picks up an empty
coffee jar, sighs and goes into the pantry a full one. BEAN enters. He opens
the refrigerator and he studies the food on offer. Nothing he fancies ...
then BINGO!

He sees a little plate of 3 strawberries. He eats     one, then two, then pops
the third into his mouth. It tastes a bit off, so     he takes it out of his
mouth, puts it back on the plate, closes the fridge    door, and exits ... just
as DAVID comes out of the pantry. Close on BEAN's     hand as it comes round the
door frame and turns off the light. DAVID, on the     move, stubs his toe on a

chair. He groans in pain, limps to the fridge.        He spots the lone, already
sucked strawberry and pops it into his mouth.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   D & A'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ALISON is watching T.V. in bed with the remote control.       DAVID enters with
orange juice and puts it down by his side of the bed.

                                      DAVID

             The lights blown in the kitchen. I'll fix it tomorrow.

They're not a happy couple.    She concentrates on the TV even turns it up a
little.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   BATHROOM - NIGHT

BEAN turns on the basin's cold faucet.       It gushes noisily.

                                                                           CUT TO:
INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   D & A'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Close on Letterman on the TV. The noise from it drowns out any noise from the
bathroom.(The bathroom has two doors - one into DAVID and ALISON's bedroom,
the other onto the landing)..

                                                                           CUT TO:
INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   BATHROOM - NIGHT

BEAN can't hear the T.V. because of his headphones. He takes out his
toothbrush but notices an electric one on a shelf with spare brush heads.
He's intrigue. He swaps the heads and enjoys cleaning his teeth with this
clever modern implement.

-He puts the   electric brush down and checks his teeth    in the mirror. He has
forgotten to   turn off the brush and so it vibrates off    the sink and lands in
the toilet.    Bean fishes it out and places it back on    the shelf where he found
it. He turns    off faucet, then exits, turning out the    light.

DAVID enters and turns the light on again. He takes down the toothbrush and
cleans his teeth. He calls through the bedroom door.

                                     DAVID
             That poor guy, Bean ... He's probably still sitting at London
             Airport!

He finishes his teeth then runs the hot faucet.       He exits to bedroom as BEAN
enters from hall with dirty socks.

                                                                           CUT TO:
INT. THE LEARY HOUSE. D & A'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ALISON is still watching T.V. The volume is getting to DAVID.

                                      DAVID
             Alison, please.

                                                                                    32

INT.   THE LEARYS' HOUSE.      BATHROOM ~ NIGHT

BEAN is just finishing washing his socks in David's water. He rings the dirty
water from them, and exits. DAVID enters in his under shorts. He checks his
tired eyes in the mirror then washes his face in the basin water without
looking.

                                                                               CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.      LANDING ~ NIGHT

BEAN notices a framed photograph on the wall. It is of the LEARY family.
They are grouped outside their house. It is a very happy picture. BEAN
smiles at it. He takes it off the wall and takes it into a bedroom. As the
door quietly closes we see the sign: 'JENNIFER'.

                                                                               CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.      D & A'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lights are out.       DAVID and ALISON in bed.    The latter is facing away.

                                       DAVID
               I need to make a confession. I know you're awake.       Please, it's
               important.

(Long pause)

                                        ALISON
                                  (without stirring)
               Go ahead.

                                       DAVID
               I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.

ALISON smiles in spite of herself. She turns over and puts her arm around
DAVID. She gets up close to his face.

                                       ALISON
               There were three strawberries.

                                         DAVID
               One.

                                                                                    33
                                        ALISON
                Liar.

                                       DAVID
               0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.

ALISON smiles, sleepily, and goes to kiss him. She stops and sniffs.
Thoroughly put off, she rolls over and closes her eyes.

                                         DAVID
               Ali?    What's wrong?

                                     ALISON
             Your face smells like a foot.

                                                                          CUT TO:

The next morning. Shot from across the street: A newspaper boy delivers.
Birds sing. It's a lovely, peaceful, early morning. Then ... a terrifying
girl's scream pierces the quiet.

The whole family charges out onto the landing. JENNIFER hurtles out of her
room screaming. She barges through the family and locks herself in the
bathroom.

                                        ALISON
             What is it?    Jennifer!

                                      (p.o.v.)
             There's a man.    I woke up next to a man ...

                                        KEVIN

           It wouldn't be the first time.

                                                                                  34


                                     ALISON
             Shut up, Kevin. (to Jennifer) Honey, you-re not making sense ...

                                       DAVID
             It's okay.    There's no one out here. Just open the door.   Trust
             me.

Pause ... then a click of the bathroom lock ... Jennifer comes out. Then
there's another click. BEAN breezes out of Jennifer's bedroom, past the
family, in his pyjamas, carrying a wash bag and a towel over his arm. He
waves to them friendly, slips into the bathroom and closes the door. The
family stare in amazement.

                                                                          CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    KITCHEN - DAY

The family, now dressed for work and school, are having breakfast at the
kitchen table. After an uncomfortable silence:

                                        KEVIN

            He makes Prince Charles look kind of handsome.

                                    ALISON
            He can't stay here, David.

                                   DAVID
            Okay. It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the
            gallery ...

                                    ALISON
            David, I'm serious!

                                     DAVID
            I know you are.   Very serious ... most of the time these days.

                                    ALISON
            Now what does that mean? My daughter wakes up with a strange man
            in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing? (looks at his
            tie) That tie's God-awful. Why do you wear it?

DAVID is thrown.   He looks down at his tie.   JENNIFER looks grumpy.   KEVIN is
eating happily.

                                                                               35

BEAN enters, dressed, carrying a plastic carrier bag.    He acknowledges the
family with a grunt and a smile.

                                     DAVID
            Ah, Mr Bean ...

                                     BEAN
            Excuse me.

 He moves to the phone, checks his watch and dials quickly.
                                                                         CUT TO:



 INT.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - ENGLAND - NIGHT

 The ancient G.P.O. phone starts to ring on a small table. (The following
 takes place in a matter of seconds).

 On the table are two, large, shiny, hard backed books, wedged up    at one end
 and sloping away at right angles to one another. Each book has a     pair of
 rulers set, parallel to one another, in Play-Doh. They each form     a canal.
 Between one pair of rulers sits a small box of salt. Between the    other pair
 is a miniature bust of BEETHOVEN. As the phone continues to ring     and
 vibrate the table, these items judder along the canal, an inch at    a time.

 The box of salt teaches the bottom of the book and topples over the edge of
 the table. ( The BEETHOVEN bust' teeters on the edge of its book). The salt
 lands in a plastic funnel, taped to the top of a bamboo stick. The bottom
 of the stick sits on the BBC 2 button of a T.V. remote control. Close-up of
 its infrared L.E.D. as it flashes once. The phone stops ringing.

 CUT TO: the T.V. comes on at the start of a documentary about grizzly bears.
                                             A voice-over begins a narration.

 CUT TO: close on TEDDY sitting in his cardboard box hotel.    Flickering light

 from the T.V. plays on his face.

                                                                              CUT TO:
 INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    KITCHEN - DAY

 Bean hangs up happily, then approaches the toaster, stuffs a pair of wet
 socks into it and pulls down the start lever. Satisfied, he now turns to
 the family.

                                         BEAN
               Now - can I help?

  They just stare, dumb-founded.

                                                                                      36

 DAVID and BEAN arrive at the car and get in.          DAVID heads out of the drive
 at a reasonable speed.

 BEAN suddenly yanks on the hand-brake. DAVID's head hits the windshield
 with a sickening thud. BEAN reaches for and fastens his seat belt. He
 looks to DAVID. DAVID gives BEAN a pained look. What planet does he come
 from? He fastens his own seat belt while BEAN wonders why it's all taking
 so long.

                                                                              CUT TO:

 It's a rather fancy building. Like a little Guggenheim DAVID parks by a
 large, expensive, looking car. BEAN opens his door and it bangs-hard

 As BEAN and DAVID enter through the swing doors they meet ANNIE, the very
 bubbly girl in charge of entrance tickets at the reception cum shop counter.

                                         ANNIE
               Two dollars please.

                                         DAVID
               Annie, it's me.

                                       ANNIE
               Oh, right, yeah. (to Bean) two dollars please.

                                         DAVID
               No, Annie, no.    This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with
               us.

BEAN frowns.    That word 'doctor'.

                                                                           37


                                    ANNIE
            Oh, great. Usually we charge people two dollars to come in- but
            for people who work here, that would be 730 dollars a year, which
            is like, a lot of money, so we kinda like let them off. Hi.

BEAN smiles at her.

                                    ANNIE
            He doesn't like to say much does he?

                                    DAVID
            Right first time.

                             ANNIE
            I can understand THAT. Neither do I.

As BEAN and DAVID move on, BEAN gives ANNIE a 1ittle wave. She waves sweetly
back. She cocks her head to one side and watches him go. She likes Mr. BEAN a
lot.

                                                                      CUT TO:

INT. GRIERSON GALLERY. GROUND FLOOR- DAY

BEAN and DAVID arrive In the ground floor gallery. A few visitors are viewing
the paintings. The acknowledge ELMER, the huge, ex-army, Security Man, sitting
on a small chair by a wall, reading a newspaper. The pass two oldish ladies
inspecting a painting

                                    DAVID
            You'll notice, our clientele is not totally young. I sometimes
            worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep
            aesthetic level.


Stay with the ladies as DAVID and BEAN head on.

                                 OLD LADY 1
            What do you think?

                                  OLD LADY 1
               And what colour would you use for the curtains?

                                                                           38

                                  OLD LADY 2
            Well, I thought the sort of blue in this one. (she points to a
            gorgeous blue Matisse) And I thought the curtains in the bathroom
            would be nice in this yellow ....

And-they head on to a Van Gogh with a nice yellow in it.

BEAN stops to admire a painting. It is Pre-Raphaelite in style, depicting a
woman reclined on a bed in a castle chamber. She is wearing a chastity belt
fastened with a small padlock, her breasts are concealed under a draped flag.

It is a tasteful and romantic picture.

                                        DAVID
              Beautiful.    'HIS MISTRESS' by John Everett Millais, 1829 to 96.
              Know it?

BEAN shakes his head. It's the padlock he's interested in he points at it and
smiles. ANNIE walks up.

                                        ANNIE
              Excuse me.    Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you
              upstairs.

                                        DAVID
              Thanks, Annie.

ANNIE walks off back the way she came, looking at BEAN approvingly over her
shoulder.

                                        DAVID
              Better go.    Grierson hates people being late.

                                        BEAN
              Yes.   Ahm... think I'11 ...

He gestures that held like to tidy up a little. Brush his hair, etc. BEAN
waddles off after ANNIE clearly in need of relief. DAVID watches him go.

                                        DAVID
              Why me?

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY.

BEAN is catching up with ANNIE. She notices him following and coyly smiles to
herself. She stops, turns round and grins. She thinks he has come to say
something to her.

                                                                                  39

BEAN stops dead in front of her - then turns sharp left into the men's
washroom. ANNIE's smile fades.


                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   WASH ROOM - DAY

BEAN    comes out of a booth. He tidies his hair and tie in a mirror. He pushes
down    the pressurised tap to wash his hands. It splashes terribly. The whole
front    of his trousers are soaked. The last thing you want when about to meet
your    new boss. Damn!

There now follow a quick, complicated piece of business.

1/ BEAN spots a paper-towel dispenser. He turns towards it at just the moment
a man exits from a booth - BEAN turns back to the sink to hide his trousers,
as the man swiftly does his hands, goes to the paper dispenser, and takes the
last towel. Damn again.

2/ BEAN    now puts    his hope in a rolling    towel. But it's rather high. He has
to jump    to try to    reach the trouser.     At which point Another Man enters.
Jumping    BEAN has    been caught in a very    weird position. He pretends he has
.chosen    the Men's    Room as the place to    do his rather energetic exercise
routine.

3/ As the man leaves, he then tries to blow the patch dry with his mouth.
Another Man enters. Again, BEAN is 1 compromised - pretends it's even more
exercises. That man also enters a booth.

4/ BEAN suddenly notices the hand drying machine! He turns it on. A healthy
blast of warm air. Annoyingly, it's also rather too high. He tries jumping
and bouncing to get his waist to the right height. It's not going to work.
Brainwave! He climbs up on two sinks. Now the drier is blowing in exactly
the right place. BEAN sways to let the air cover the whole area. It's
working excellently.

5/ At which moment, one of the men exits from         a booth and sees him in the
mirror. BEAN is in an immensely compromising          sex-with-machine position. He
pretends he's there to change the light bulb         above, which he takes out calmly
and polishes. The man leaves, BEAN smiles.           But as he exits, BEAN's face
transforms - he's totally scalded his fingers         on the scorching bulb.

                                                                                   40


6/ BEAN rushes to the sink, puts his fingers under the tap, pushes on the
water - and soaks himself all over again. At which moment, DAVID enters,
exasperated.

                                          DAVID
                Come on!     Let's go!

 BEAN exits uneasily hunched to hide his wet patch.          They enter the corridor,
 and he spots a newspaper.

                                                                              CUT TO:

 INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

 BEAN and DAVID enter. It's        a warm, formal. office. On the wall behind the
 desk is a full-size, framed       poster of Whistler's Mother. On a white
 background, at the base of       the poster, a caption reads: 'THE GRIERSON
 GALLERY, HOME OF WHISTLER'S       MOTHER'. Elsewhere, the walls are full of
 paintings.

 GRIERSON and BERNIE look up from a computer screen at DAVID and BEAN, who
 is, rather weirdly, carrying a newspaper in fronts of his flies. GRIERSON
 approaches David, and shakes his hand.

                                      GRIERSON
               Ah, David. Finally. (CHECKS HIS WATCH DELIBERATELY ) And this
               must be our professor from across the sea.

                                       DAVID
               Yes, this is Doctor Bean.

                                        BEAN
               Actually I'm not .... er ...

                                    GRIERSON
             This is Bernard Schimmel. Bernie the Doctor.

 BERNIE offers his hand. BEAN has to do a nifty handchange to free up the
 correct hand for the handshake. The newspaper stays firmly in place.

                                THOMAS GRIERSON
             Ah ~ the Tribune - mind if I just ....

He reaches out to borrow the newspaper. BEAN has to squeeze in right next to
the desk and sit behind it, before he can hand the paper over   thus ensuring
the continued invisibility of the wet patch. GRIERSON studies the paper for a
second.

                                    GRIERSON
             Take a seat, gentlemen..... although before we settle - feast your
             eyes on these.

GRIERSON goes to a painting on a wall. DAVID and BEAN follow ~ BEAN about one
inch from DAVID's back, walking in perfect rhythm.

                                    GRIERSON
             Arthur Rackham. Originals of course. Got four of them. Check
             this out ... Venus and the Cat, Aesop's Fables. Isn't that
             something?

He heads towards said illustration on adjacent wall - and BEAN and DAVID
follow, still totally glued together. A strange sight.

                                       DAVID.
             They're beautiful, sir.

                                   GRIERSON
             Maybe. Hell of a price, I'11 tell you.     Anyway - down to
             business.

 They head back to the desk - but Bean, in a momentary lapse of concentration
 fails to follow. He's now stuck on the wrong side of the room, unable to
 turn around.

                                    GRIERSON
             Bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross-gallery
             computer system. Dr Bean - would you like to look at this? Very
             exciting stuff ....

                                        BEAN
             Ahm ... NO.

GRIERSON is slightly surprised.   But they persevere.

                                     BERNIE
             What I'm doing, Dave, is developing the ultimate user-friendly,'
             interactive public guide to the gallery.

Punching buttons on the computer, he reveals wonderful maps of the gallery,
and when clicking on sections of the map, graphic explanations of each rooms
contents.

                                                                                 42

Meanwhile.   Bean has spotted a fan on the other side of the room.    He moves

around the room, always facing straight to the wall. When he reaches the fan,
he switches it on: unfortunately it's a rotating fan - so to keep the wind on
his trousers, BEAN has to do a strange, rhythmic dancing movement, following
the arc of the fan.

                                       DAVID
           It's very good Bernie.

                                   BERNIE
           But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work
           oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the
           program to every room in the gallery.

                                     GRIERSON
             Not bad, eh?    What do you think, Doctor?   Ah.... Doctor Bean?

 BEAN turns, shocked to    have been observed. He looks down at his trousers
 and, HOORAY!, they're    dry at last. He's delighted, and moves back across
 the road towards them,    hands in pockets, in a big, confident, groin-
 thrusting, dry-trouser    boasting walk.

                                   GRIERSON
             Well, thanks for dropping by. Enjoy your stay with our Vice
             President and his family. They're simple people.-.but warm,
             yes, Doctor?

                                    BEAN
           I'm not actually... um...

                                   GRIERSON
             ... Settled in yet. I know. Plenty of time. Bernie, perhaps
             you'd like to take Dr. Bean on a tour of the gallery.

                                      BERNIE
           Absolutely.     This way, sir.

 BEAN displays his crotch proudly one last time before he and BERNIE exit.
 GRIERSON tries to fathom the strange man who just left.

                                     GRIERSON
           He's a genius, right?



                                                                                43


                                   DAVID
           Ah... He certainly has something, sir.

                                  GRIERSON
           Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's
           job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.

                                   DAVID
           Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have
           him with us. The whole family's very excited.

                                     GRIERSON
           Glad to hear it.     Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?

                                      DAVID
           You're not going to ....

                                  GRIERSON
           Sack him? David, what else can I do? This business is not,
           repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this
           morning?

 DAVID frowns then sees.

                                    DAVID
              You've tinted your hair? It takes years off you, sir.

GRIERSON beams.


                                                      MIX THROUGH TO:

INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   RECEPTION AREA - DAY

End of the day.. ANNIE perks    up at the reception desk as DAVID, but
especially BEAN, approaches    from the gallery area. She has a pile of
tissues near-by and draws a    heart on one of them. She arranges it on the
counter-top where BEAN could    not fail to see it on his way to the exit.

                                      DAVID
           Goodnight Annie.

                                      ANNIE
           Night.

BEAN does not even notice her.    As DAVID heads for the exit, BEAN suddenly
sneezes.

                                                                               44

He reaches for ANNIE's love message and blows his nose on it. He drops the
tissue in a bin as he exits.

ANNIE sighs her disappointment.

                                                                        CUT TO:
EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   BY PARKING LOT - DAY

(About 5 p.m.) BEAN and DAVID head for the parking lot. On the way, BEAN's
interest is drawn to the MIME ARTIST we met before in his Clinton mask,
performing his heart out in front of the Dead Cars sculpture. BEAN lingers.

The MIME accosts a woman, pretending to brush dust from her clothes, comb
her hair etc. The MIME is a bit of a pain in the ass really. The woman
quickly moves on.

BEAN is intrigued. The MIME mimes climbing a ladder. BEAN goes up next to
him - and looks up. There's nothing there. He decides the MIME is a bit of
a tricky. This is confirmed when the MIME pretends he's locked behind a
pane of glass. BEAN simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass
wall, and hits the MIME's nose.

                                 CUT TO: DAVID watching bemusedly some way off.

The MIME is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last.    He

 takes a handkerchief from BEAN's pocket, and gets BEAN to guess which hand
 the hanky's in. It's not in the left. Not in the right. BEAN isn't the
 slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y from
 where it's tucked into the MIME's trousers - and heads away. As he moves
 off, the MIME touches h' on the shoulder. BEAN turns and the MIME starts a
 mocking gun duel. He draws his guns. BEAN is pretty unimpressed.

 The MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 He turns ....

 But now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all. In a brilliant piece
 of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold
 Schwarzenegger movie. He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a
 hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun. Then opens
 another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it.

 The MIME is getting very frightened. Then BEAN pulls up an imaginary stool
 to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun. The MIME begins to run away. BEAN
 twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the
 terrified MIME.

                                                                             45

 Finally, in a BOOM that almost knocks BEAN out of his imaginary seat, he
 fires. 10 seconds delay, and the MIME falls in a very dramatic death, 50
 yards away.

BEAN is happy - and heads back to the parking lot where DAVID, arms folded,
leans against his car. DAVID gets into his car. BEAN opens the passenger
door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next-door (same
as this morning).

                                                                       CUT TO:

EXT.   SHOPPING MALL.   PARKING LOT - DAY

DAVID parks next to a beaten up convertible.

                                      DAVID

             Okay. I'll get some steaks. Alison loves steak ... Wine - good.
             Candy? No candy. Alison hates candy. We gotta do this right,
             Bean, or ... (looks at Bean) Just stay out of trouble, okay?

BEAN nods.   DAVID gets out and heads for the mall.   Nearby woman tramp (BAG
LADY) goes   through a trash can.

BEAN tries to control himself but weakens. He plays with all the buttons and
switches on the dashboard; windshield wipers, lights. Then he notices a
throbbing noise ... He gets out of the car to investigate.

BEAN swiftly locates the throbbing sound. The e-empty convertible has its
engine running. BEAN notices the keys in the ignition. How stupid of
someone. He turns off the engine and takes out the keys. There are several
people returning to their cars with groceries. BEAN offers the car keys to
them as if to say: "Are these yours?"

[The following should take place at quite a speed, real drama.]

Then suddenly, A ROBBER dashes towards BEAN from the direction ' of the Mall,
weaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly
full of money. He wears jeans, a black polo-neck and, much to BEAN's delight,

a PRESIDENT CLINTON face-mask.      As far as BEAN's concerned, this is his old
friend, the MIME.

ROBBER throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets
in - but he cant find the keys to start it. He frantically searches all his
pockets ...

                                                                                  46


BEAN leans into shot.     He holds out the keys, grinning.

                                       ROBBER
             Gimme the keys!

BEAN runs away with them. Or doesn't! He is in mime mode - And runs on the
spot, getting faster and faster. The ROBBER approaches this obvious madman.
He is quite a tough, scary, and scared individual.

                                     ROBBER
             I said, give me the keys!

BEAN turns and holds out two hands, just like the MIME did to him. The
perplexed ROBBER picks one hand. Wrong one. He then.... pulls a gun and puts
it hard to MR BEAN in BEAN's face. Passers-by scream and fall to the ground,
the bag lady amongst them. Sudden harsh reality.

But not to BEAN. He simply takes the gun, and waves it in the ROBBER's face,
ticking him off for breaking the rules.

                                     ROBBER
             OKAY, OKAY - TAKE IT EASY!!!

BEAN gestures the ROBBER to turn around. He does, sure this sicko is going
simply to shoot him in the head. But instead BEAN puts his back to the
ROBBER's back, and starts to count

                                        BEAN
              1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7,8, 9,10

He turns and gestures to the ROBBER it's time to draw.       By this time a crowd
has gathered.

                                     ROBBER
             But I haven't got a f.....

                                        BEAN
             Ssssh!!!!

He points out a small child, watching from behind a trash can.


                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   SHOPPING MALL.    EXT.   COFFEE SHOP ~ DAY

DAVID is hurrying back to the parking lot, with a bag of groceries, and a big
bunch of red roses.. He stops dead in his tracks as he spots something ...

                                                                                  47

ALISON and CHARLES are sitting up on stools, in the window of a coffee shop.
ALISON laughs at something that CHARLES says. Their body language suggests a
certain closeness. DAVID is saddened. He hurries away.

                                                                      CUT TO:
EXT.   SHOPPING MALL.   PARKING LOT ~ DAY

BEAN waves the gun at the ROBBER.

                                       ROBBER
             I haven't got a gun.

But BEAN is pushing him to draw.      Finally...

                                      ROBBER
                             Okay, okay, I'11 do it!

He draws. BEAN draws too. They fire. And BEAN really fires. To his
amazement. Onlookers scream. BEAN throws the gun away in startlement.

The ROBBER lunges for it ~ BEAN kicks it away, trying to help him avoid such a
dangerous implement.

The ROBBER lunges at BEAN who throws the keys away over his shoulder. The
ROBBER has to scrabble under a car for them- BEAN thinks of final joke - and
niftly swaps the ROBBER's bag, for one of the Old BAG LADY's bags. A few
dollar notes spill out of it.

When the ROBBER emerges with the keys, BEAN 's waiting to escort him to his
car. He opens the door - then spots a tourist hiding and puts his arm around
the ROBBER and gets him to take a photograph of them. BEAN removes the
ROBBER's mask as the picture is taken. Forgetting himself, the ROBBER smiles
for the camera.

The ROBBER, jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching Police car
sirens, jumps in the car and drives away. BEAN waves goodbye to the
convertible as a couple of Police cars screech up. COPS jump out.

DAVID approaches the scene with groceries and roses. What kind of hell has
BEAN caused now? But instead of trouble, he sees the passers-by are getting
to their feet, applauding BEAN and whistling! They crowd round the COPS
explaining what a hero BEAN has been.

BEAN hands over the gun to a COP. He doesn't really understand what all the
fuss is about. He notices the BAG

                                                                            48

LADY wandering away with her bags. Should he tell her that he has swapped one
of them for the ROBBER'S? No. He's getting too much attention to be bothered.
A COP comes up to BEAN. It is COP 1 from the airport scene.

                                        COP 1
                         Excuse me.    Mr. er ... Cabbage?

Sudden mutual recognition.

                                                                      CUT TO:

INT.   POLICE PRECINCT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT

Classic smoked filled room with street light cutting through half closed
Venetian blinds. Two or three DETECTIVES slouched in the shadows.

BRUTUS, the   huge    black detective from    earlier, sits opposite BEAN    at a table,
smoking. He    is    looking at a photo. A     close-up reveals it to be a    full length
one of BEAN   and    the ROBBER outside the    mall with the ROBBER's face    unmasked.
BRUTUS eyes   BEAN    for a while. BEAN is     terrified. BRUTUS taps the     photo.

                                         BRUTUS
              It's Eddie Guardino.     Go pick him up.

One of the DETECTIVES lazily leaves the room.          BRUTUS leans forward on his
elbows.

                                      BRUTUS
              Guardino fled the scene with 160 K, in a white plastic bag. We got
              the car. We got the bag. And we got 20 pairs of stinking
              pantyhose. (drags on his cigarette) Anything you wanna tell me?

BEAN looks at h4-m blankly.       BRUTUS holds up the photo.

                                      BRUTUS
              'Fraid I'm gonna have to keep this.

BEAN calmly takes the picture and tears it in half. He gives back the ROBBER
half and puts the other half, with himself on, into his pocket. BRUTUS glares
at him.

                                         BRUTUS
              Mr. Bean.     You lookin' to stay long in California?

                                                                                      49


BEAN grins.    At last.     A question he can answer.     He nods, happily.

                                       MR. BEAN
              Oh, yes.

                                                                                 CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARYS' HOUSE.      KITCHEN - NIGHT

DAVID is talking to KEVIN. BEAN is there. In the background, Jennifer plays
with a computer game. DAVID is very animated.

                                         DAVID
              He was incredible.     This guy is fearless.     He has no fear.

                                      KEVIN
              That's one - way of looking at it.        You might also say this guy is
              brainless he has no brain'.

                                         DAVID
              Well, there is that ...

                                       KEVIN
                                    (TO BEAN )
              I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?

                                        BEAN
             Ahm....


                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARYS' HOUSE.   KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

KEVIN is playing an adventure game: `GOBLINS 2' [This game exists.] The
GOBLINS chuckle and make stupid noises that BEAN can imitate. A catchy piece
of music accompanies the game.

The computer monitor shows the inside of the WIZARD's house. KEVIN moves the
GOBLINS, and two little characters, FINGUS and WINKLE, around the room by
clicking on areas in the room with his mouse.

BEAN and KEVIN are both wearing pointed goblin hats made from newspaper.

                                                                                  50

                                     KEVIN
             It's so embarrassing. All the guys I know are on Goblins 3 and
             I'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2.

 BEAN is interested in the computer because he likes the cute little GOBLINS.
 He gets his delighted face right up to the screen. He sings along with the
 catchy tune. KEVIN is getting frustrated.

                                        KEVIN
             Come on, winkle.

 KEVIN clicks on a cuckoo clock in the WIZARD's room.       The cuckoo pops out
 holding a key in its beak.

                                        KEVIN
              It's gotta be here.     Something to get the key away from the
              stupid cuckoo.

 BEAN scans the monitor screen: he spots a little frog at the bottom of the
 scene. His eyes light up. He takes the mouse and rapidly and repeatedly
 clicks on the frog.

                                        BEAN
                       Click, click, click, click, click ...

 The frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone.       KEVIN gets excited.

                                        KEVIN
              How'd you do that!?     That was so obvious!!!

 BEAN grins and makes WINKLE pick up the stone. Then he clicks through to
 inside the wizard's house. He makes WINKLE throw the stone at the cuckoo
 which instantly drops the key from its beak.


                                     KEVIN
             Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool!

 KEVIN slaps BEAN on the back.      BEAN is delighted.   Close on monitor, showing
 The Goblin game-

                                                                         CUT TO:

 INT.   LIVING ROOM.    DAY

 Another game. JENNIFER'S Super Nintendo game on TV in the lounge area. It
 is a Gothic game where he-man types attack Vampires and bats with swords.

                                                                              51

DAVID is in the kitchen - setting out the roses in a vase.    The door opens -
enter ALISON. Some tension.

                                      DAVID
            Hi,

                                      ALISON
            Hi..... (PAUSE ) Roses.

                                    DAVID
            Yes. And    I have a wine for dinner
            that will kill you.

                                    ALISON
            Great. ( SHE SETTLES A LITTLE ) You said you'd ask Grierson about
            putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?

                                      DAVID
            Sort of half.....

                                      ALISON
            Meaning?

                                    DAVID
            I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have
            asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.

                                    ALISON
            Honestly David, you're so spineless.

Pause. Jennifer looks around.   She can't help but hear.   Not a happy
experience.

                                      DAVID
            Roses.     Wine.

He is asking her for softness. Pause. At which moment BEAN enters wearing
pointy hat. He helps himself to a melon from a bowl. He grins and exits.
ALISON looks at DAVID sadly.

                                      ALISON
              But no real change.

Almost instantly, BEAN is back. He rummages through a drawer and takes out
some large elastic bands. And leaves.

                                    ALISON
            I really do need some time on my own. Away from here.

                                                                              52

                                     DAVID
             Look, Bean's history. I swear to you, he's packing as we speak.
             And you can't leave. ( HE PICKS UP THE BAMBI ) I've got Bambi.
             You never go anywhere without him. Please let's just talk.


                                     ALISON
             Okay. ( GHOST OF A SMILE ) Put Bambi down, and we'll talk.

He puts Bambi down on the side-table, on the flat surface of his CD player.
BEAN appears again behind her, now looking even madder. Pointy hat, large
pointy ears made from melon peel, held in place by the rubber band stretched
round his face ~ huge front teeth also cut from the melon. He grins
gleefully.

DAVID and ALISON just stare. BEAN is followed by KEVIN who wears the same ears
and teeth.

                                     DAVID
             Look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to ... Jennifer -
             could you turn that damn thing down.

It is quite loud. JENNIFER looks for the remote control. BEAN helpfully picks
up a remote control from the sofa and points it across the room.

                                     ALISON
             No, that's not for the TV. That's for the ...

Too late! BEAN punches a button and the lid of the CD
player launches the Bambi into the air.

DAVID sees it. In slow motion he dives dramatically and just misses it.         It
smashes on the floor.

BEAN raises his eyes heavenwards, shakes his head and tuts.        He thinks DAVID
is a real Butter Fingers.

JENNIFER, upset, has found the TV remote and unintentionally switches from the
Vampire game to a TV channel. It's very loud.

ALISON gives DAVID a tearful look, and shakes her head.

                                                                             CUT TO:

EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE      NIGHT.

A taxi drives away.      Alison is in it.
                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.   HALLWAY- NIGHT.

JENNIFER and KEVIN are in their night clothes. They sit with David on the
stairs ~ still looking at the door-Alison left through.


                                           KEVIN
                I wish I    could use    that at school. "Hey, Teach, no hard
                feelings    ... It's    just things between us ain't what they used
                to be and    I need a    little space, ya know? So I'11 see you
                around in    a couple    of years, maybe".

                                    JENNIFER
             It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.

She gets up and walks away.

                                     DAVID
             Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?

                                    JENNIFER
             It's you and Mom that need to talk.

                                        DAVID
             Sure.    You're right.

                                     KEVIN
             You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are
             you, Dad?

                                      JENNIFER
                                  (FROM HER DOOR)
             Of course he is.

                                        KEVIN
             Are you?

                                        DAVID
              Yes, I am.    I must.


                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   HALL/BEAN'S ROOM.   DAY.


DAVID heads for Mr BEAN's room, and knocks cautiously on the door.

                                                                                 54

                                         BEAN
                                      (o. o. v)
             Enter.

 DAVID enters - Camera follows as DAVID finds his way through BEAN's washing
 hanging from strings across the room. BEAN is sticking things in a picture
 album.

                                        DAVID
             Hi, am I disturbing you?

 BEAN gives him an affable smile. In a pause before he quite gathers himself
 to broach the difficult subject, DAVID asks a polite question.

                                        DAVID
             May I?

 BEAN acquiesces. He starts from the beginning, with pictures of him as a
 kid. Always standing on his own.

 Picture of BEAN with mop of frizzy hair, at 16.    DAVID smiles.   BEAN mimes
 stupid disco dancing.

 DAVID turns another page. It is a sequence      of pictures of BEAN at famous UK
 locations - Big Ben, Stonehenge, Buckingham     Palace, 10 Downing Street. They
 are .idiosyncratic because all taken by him     at arms length with his Polaroid
 - so he never quite makes it squarely into     shot.

 A whole page of Teddy. Then three pages of BEAN's mini with dates, on
 labels, going way back.

 Then a whole page of garden gnomes.

                                      DAVID
              None of your folks here - Family?

 BEAN starts to look for something in particular.      DAVID uses the pause to
 broach the awful subject.

                                      DAVID
              Look... the reason I came in here was to ... well... since you've
              been here twelve all...

 BEAN has    found what he was looking for. It is the picture of the family
 that he    took from the landing on his first night here. What's left of the
 Polaroid    of himself, from the mall, that he rescued from BRUTUS, is stuck
 next to    it. He's even written - 'Bean & Family' - he doesn't realise there's
 anything    sad about it. But DAVID is rather moved. Pause.

                                                                                 55

                                      DAVID
              Well, that's er...great. Look, I just came in ... (no, he cant do
              it) ... to say good night. Okay?

BEAN nods.    DAVID smiles and goes to the door.

BE-AN waves good-bye a little rudely and gets back to the album. Even when we
feel sorry for him, he's a little rude. DAVID walks away, shaking his head.

                                       DAVID
              Spineless.
                                                                          CUT TO:

INT.   DAVID AND ALISON'S BEDROOM.

The first morning without ALISON.    "She's Gone" by Hall & Oats begins to play,
a song full of yearning.

DAVID feels the other side of the bed.    No-one there.

He walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower. Then walks back into the
bedroom - She's gone - I've got to learn how to face it " He takes a towel
from a cupboard and returns to the bathroom. He feels very alone.

He removes his pyjamas and gets into the steam-filled shower. - she's gone -
she's gone" - but the camera moves to reveal that he is not alone after all.
BEAN has, simply entered the shower, and is now happily soaping himself,
wearing ALISON's shower cap. manly screams from the both of them.

                                                                          CUT TO:
INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   CANTEEN - DAY.

DAVID sitting down at table, with BEAN, who is tucking in happily ~ eating a
burger & bun with knife and fork. DAVID speaks after a longish pause.

                                      DAVID
              Bean can I ask you something?

BEAN nods.

                                      DAVID
              Do you think you can ever really know someone? Even if you've
              known them, well, almost all your life? What do you think?

                                                                              56


 BEAN thinks hard, then looks at his watch, makes his excuses and simple
 walks away.

                                                                         CUT TO:

 INT.    GALLERY CORRIDOR.     DAY.

 BEAN at a pay phone.      He dials carefully-
                                                                         CUT TO:

 INT.    BEAN'S BED-SIT.     DAY

 10 am U.K.    time. (The following takes place in a matter of seconds) Close on
 the T.V. A    morning kids show blares out. A huge wardrobe stands four feet
 away from    a wall. There is a string tied to one of it's door handles,
 stretching    out of shot. The wardrobe seems to be leaning backwards at an
 angel. It     rocks slightly and creaks. (Feature its padlock).

 There is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet, see-saw
 fashion. One end of it is wedged under the wardrobe.

 BEAN's G.P.O. phone rings on the table and it's vibrations cause the bust of
 BEETHOVEN to fall over the edge of the table. It lands on the end of the
 ironing board. The Wardrobe groans as it is set off balance and falls
 against the wall with a heavy thump! and raising of dust. The string tied
 to its handle becomes taut.

CUT TO: the T.V. plug in its socket. This end of the string is tied to it.
The string tightens and the plug is yanked out of the socket.
The T.V. screen goes blank. Shot of TEDDY in the cardboard hotel'.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.    CANTEEN.   DAY.

BEAN returns, sits down and starts to eat again. David is still deep in
thought.

                                        DAVID

              Well, they say there's only one way to get over this sort of
              thing. Take it day by day. Keep working. Keep to your normal
              patterns. That's the only hope. So let's just ... take today
              shall we?

                                                                                57

BEAN nods.    He is not on David's emotional level here.

                                      DAVID
              I think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame.
              She's all around you ... how do you fancy meeting her in the
              flesh?

 Sure enough, all around are posters, and the silhouette of Whistler's
 Mother. BEAN nods, though fairly distracted by the slice of gherkin he's
 found in his bun and now picks out with his fingers.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY.

BEAN and David en route to the painting.

                                      DAVID
              I usually only let her out for the big summer exhibition - but'
              let's see whether what they say about the healing power of great
              works of art is true, huh?

                                                                         CUT TO:


 INT.    THE WHOLE GALLERY - DAY

 BEAN and DAVID do the rest of the journey, in quick cuts - along corridors -
 in an elevator. A sense of expectation and excitement. En route, they are
 joined by ELMER, the huge Security Guard.

 The three arrive outside a large oak door. ELMER ceremoniously unlocks the
 door, all the time glaring at BEAN - who swallows hard. A light turns green
 and a buzzer sounds.

 Then there is the door to the inner sanctum. ELMER stares at BEAN as he
 unlocks it. Another light turns green and another buzzer sounds.

                                      DAVID
              As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.   Nobody
              gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right?

                                      ELMER
              Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like
              my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with
              her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.

                                                                                58


                                      DAVID
              You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me
              David?

                                      ELMER
              Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm
              calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're
              my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15.

He salutes, glares at BEAN and walks away.        BEAN and DAVID enters the room.
BEAN looks warily back at ELMER

                                      DAVID
              You think he's tough you should see the size of the hunk that
              works the night shift.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      THE WHISTLER ROOM - DAY.

The room is very dark, only tiny lights in the corner.

                                        DAVID
              Stay there.    Keep your eyes closed. One final lock, one final key.

DAVID unlocks double doors in a wall with a plastic key card. Buzz - click!
The camera holds on BEAN, his eyes tight shut. The lights go up on BEAN's
face, a magical golden glow.

                                          DAVID
              Right.   Open now.

Cut round - and there is this beautiful and very famous painting, lovingly
shot. Music. Atmosphere. Glory.

BEAN opens his eyes and looks at the painting.

                                          BEAN

              Mmmmm. Nice.

                                      DAVID
              I'11 leave you with her for a few minutes. I'm sure you'll want
              to give her a proper inspection. But whatever you do, don't leave
              the room. Megasecurity, okay? Catch you.

BEAN nods. DAVID leaves him.         BEAN is still for a while and then goes up and
inspects it closely.

                                                                                    59

He tuts disapprovingly as he spots dust on the bottom of the frame. He blows
it away fussily. He steps back to admire the painting. There is dust up his
nose and... SNEEZE - all over the painting!

He takes out his handkerchief and wipes the spittle off in panic. Then looks
back at the painting. Unfortunately, there now seems to be a big blue mark
right across Mrs Whistler's face..

BEAN checks his handkerchief. Yes, there's wet ink all over it. He finds the
leaking pen in his pocket. 0 God. He takes out his shirt, spits on it and
tries to wipe the painting, but he can't make the shirt reach it. He takes
the painting down from the wall and has another go. NO GOOD! The ink just
spreads right over Whistler's Mother's pure white collar.

BEAN    now looks round in panic. What the hell can he do? He goes to the heavy
door    - and looks out into the corridor. He hears someone coming, hides and
sees    a young girl from the catering staff wheeling a slightly squeaky trolley
past,    covered with a white cloth.

He goes back in - and has an idea.        He goes to a little table in the corner
and begins to take thing off it.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.     GALLERY.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY.

The    door opens, and    BEAN emerges, pushing what appears to be a trolley covered
with    a white cloth.     Although, if you look carefully, this trolley actually
has    no legs. It is     the painting covered with the table cloth. To make it a
bit    more convincing,    BEAN makes an apt squeaky noise.

He proceeds along the thin corridor - and then sees another exactly similar
trolley coming right towards him.' A problem. As they get close, BEAN
suddenly pretends he sees something astonishing behind the on-coming man.

                                            BEAN
                                     (silently mouths)
                What the ... !!!

When    the   man turns, BEAN just twists his painting sideways and shoots past
him.     We   see the face of the deeply perplexed trolley-pusher when he looks
back    and   BEAN is no longer there. He turns round to BEAN, who turns back to
him    with   a totally blank and innocent look. BEAN sees an elevator and heads
for    it.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                                                                    60

INT.     THE GRIERSON GALLERY.     ELEVATOR - DAY

Inside the elevator, BEAN relaxes for a moment. He leans the painting against
the wall and presses the third floor button. The bell dings.

                           ELEVATOR VOICE
                Second floor.

BEAN manages to get the painting into trolley position before the doors open
to a group of six very fat middle aged people. They all wear large badges
declaring them to be members of a 'Diet Club'. They squeeze into the elevator
along both sides of BEAN's trolley. There is a very, very, THIN WOMAN behind
them who can't fit on.

                                      THIN WOMAN
                I guess I'll see you up there, guys.

The doors close. As the painting is wedged against the fat people's stomachs
on both sides, BEAN is able to let go of it and make a great show of checking
his watch. He nonchalantly, drums the fingers of both hands on the top of the
trolley'. The bell dings.

                               ELEVATOR VOICE
                Third floor.

The doors open. BEAN flips the painting onto its side and strolls out of the
elevator. The 'Diet Cub, members stare, after him.

BEAN heads on, squeaking - and at last sees what he's looking for.        A men's
room.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.    MEN'S ROOM - DAY

BEAN enters, relieved. It is small, just a little sink, a towel and a toilet.
About a yard wide - but the picture fits in.

BEAN starts to wash the painting very carefully and lo!! The ink starts to
come off. Massive relief. Then, alas, someone tries the handle of the door.
BEAN speeds up. A knock. He peers out the keyhole. There are now 4 people
waiting. BEAN is very worried.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.-GRIERSON GALLERY.     OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Pause. Then out comes BEAN, drying his empty hands, miming, "Sorry, Sorry.".
We see into the toilet. nothing there. No sign of the painting. BEAN turns
sharply left.

                                                                           CUT TO:
EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY

DAVID is talking to BERNIE in the grounds.       We can see the side of the whole
gallery in shot as they talk.

                                        BERNIE
             I was hoping DU.     Bean might take a look at my computer project
             today.

                                    DAVID
              Yes. I'11 mention it to him.       But ... he's kind of his own guy,
              you know?

                                     BERNIE
             Howls he getting on with the family?

                                         DAVID
             Ah. Fine.     It's good.   It's great.

 We will be slightly distracted by      the observation that Whistler's Mother,
 America's most valuable painting,      is at this moment balanced on a very thin
 ledge three floors up - where Bean      has put in, outside the Men's room
 window. A bird and then a couple       more birds perch on it.

                                        BERNIE
             And howls Alison?

                                     DAVID
             She's ... well, she's good.

                                     BERNIE
             Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.
             Nice guy. Good looking.

                                         DAVID
             Yes, isn't he.

                                        BERNIE

             It's great when people who work together can become real friends.

                                        DAVID
             Isn't it?

                                                                                   62

                                     BERNIE
             I like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even
             though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that
             way, huh?

DAVID doesn't quite see what BERNIE is getting at but smiles politely.

Now we see BEAN's plan -    he has emerged at a nearby window. He    can't reach
the painting at first.     So he stretches further and further out   the window.
No good. Finally he has     to go out on the ledge. He shoos away    the birds, who
then decide to settle on    him instead. Finally he gets a hand on    the painting.
As he does so, he loses    hold. He just manages to grabs a window    before he
falls.

                                     DAVID
             Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie -
             always a subtle joy.

                                      BERNIE
             Thanks, David.   Always a pleasure.

Period.

BEAN is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the
painting. It is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics. DAVID turns to go.

                                        BERNIE
             By the way. Don't     know what you think, Mr Vice President, but
             I've been hinting    to the old man that someone's got to have the
             balls to take some    sort of emergency measures around here - or
             we're all in the
             crap house. What     do you think?


                                     DAVID
             'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?

                                    BERNIE
             Not necessarily. That's where this ... ( POINTS TO HIS BRAIN )
             comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll
             hear soon enough.

BERNIE grins and walks away. Bean does one final swing, and ....

                                                                              CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.   STOREROOM - DAY.

A small storeroom where Bean's wriggling bottom is just coming back through
the window. He has the picture and is safe.

He sets the picture down on a table.      Darn!   The birds have done their
business on it.

He maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a shelf. He
chooses a can, too rusty to read its label, takes off the lid and sniffs.
This smells like the right sort of stuff. He pours the liquid on to a rag and
rubs it on the face of Mrs. Whistler. The solvent effortlessly removes the
ink stain. Whistler's Mother looks as good as new.

BEAN is so, so, relieved. But then he notices something else happening.      The
liquid did not stop with removing the stain. It is now busy removing
Whistler's Mother's face entirely. As Bean watches-in frozen horror,
America's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas.

BEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought.     Removing the pen
that started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back    on Whistler's
Mother's 'face. He doesn't have much time. It shows. Where       once was a
sublime oil painting, is now a biro line-drawing which looks    a little like
Danny de Vito.

Bean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked. Unfortunately,
there's a nail there. The picture tears, Bean panics - it tears even more.
Total destruction.

                                                                         CUT TO:



 INT.     GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY.


BEAN Hurries down the corridor with his pseudo-trolley again, and a vaguely
mad look on his face. He spots ANNIE at a drinks machine. She smiles sweetly
(here comes her man) BEAN takes a sharp left into an adjacent corridor. ANNIE
is hurt.

                                       ANNIE
               True love can be very hard.

INT.     THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   THE WRONG ROOM - DAY

Close on the double doors (identical to those of the Whistler Room) BEAN
enters with the Painting, under the

                                                                                 64

cloth. He closes the doors and rests a moment to catch his breath.     He takes a
step into the room and freezes.

The    very fat 'Diet Club, people are seated at easels, paint brushes poised.
The    very THIN WOMAN is standing in the centre of the room in her underwear
with    a Greek urn perched on her shoulder. All eyes are on BEAN, who exits
very    quickly.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.     INNER SANCTUM.   WHISTLER ROOM DAY.

BEAN gets back to the right rooms and closes the door desperately behind him.

He stands frozen for a second - and at that moment, a hand tries the door.

BEAN leaps at it and stops. the handle turning. Then there's a knock. BEAN
moves the big table in front of the door - he's barricading himself in.
There's a famous Rodin sculpture in there - he shoves it along to block, the
door as well. When he's succeeded, he leans hot and sweaty against it - and a
door on the other side of the room calmly opens and .... DAVID walks in.

                                     DAVID
             Seems to be a problem with the door.(PAUSE) Where's the picture
             gone?

                                       BEAN
             Ahm.....

                                       DAVID
             What?    What?

Pause.   Pause.    BEAN finally shows it.   Not a pretty sight.

                                       DAVID
             Oh Jesus. Oh God.     Oh Jesus God.   Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh
             Jesus of Nazareth.

                                       BEAN
             oh dear.

                                       DAVID
             What happened?!!!

                                      BEAN
             Ahm.... (setting himself up for an interesting, comprehensive
             answer).

                                                                                 65

                                     DAVID
             Don't bother (panicking) Oh my god.....

He rushes to the door he just came in - and locks it.

             Wait a minute - why am I worrying about this? I did it. I just go
             out and tell them what happened - you're a madman from England and
             you did this terrible thing and it's not my fault. That's right,
             isn't it?

BEAN nods, knowing he deserves his doom.

             Perfect - and then they say - who left him alone with the
             picture?" And I say - "me". And they say "you're fired". And I
             say ' right'. And so I get fired and you go to jail and no one's
             any happier.

BEAN shakes his head.

             And then they say, "firing David isn't enough - let's prosecute
             him for negligence. And they prosecute me and it turns out I was
             negligent and I go to jail, and my wife leaves me and my daughter
             becomes a prostitute and I end up on Death Row sharing a cell with
             Butch McDick, the infamous gay rapist - or worse, I end up in the
             same cell as you!

BEAN looks hurt.

             No, no...Now, let's just be calm let's think about this calmly.
             (he tries - and fails ... ) Oh Godigodigod! Okay, now wait.
             Let's have another look at it.

BEAN shows it to him.

             Jesus!!! I'm already thinking back to 5 minutes ago as paradise.
             5 minutes ago - just walking along, shooting the breeze with my
             old pal Bernie.

BEAN then he has a brilliant idea. He hangs the painting back up in the
security cupboard and closes the doors. Then he removes from his pocket a
small note book.

                                                                               66



He scribbles something on it, tears the page out, licks it and sticks it on
the cupboard door. It reads `OUT OF ORDER'.



                                      DAVID
             Brilliant.   Brilliant. Problem solved!

BEAN is delighted.

             Apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who opens the
             cupboard will say -"Look, someone's totally destroyed Whistler's
             Mother- let's kill them".

BEAN is less delighted.

              No - the most important thing is tbat no-one sees it.
              Ever again!

He locks the cupboard with his plastic card key-

               That's the first thing. Then ... that's the first thing....
               Next ... next is the next thing which is... obviously... ritual
               suicide. Look, let's get out of here. Try to act natural.

The let themselves out and go into the corridor- BEAN acting his version of
`natural' - very liquid.

                                                                       CUT TO:



INT.   CORRIDOR.   DAY-

They bump straight into GRIERSON and ELMER.

                                     GRIERSON
             Ah, David.   Showing Dr. Bean our good lady?

                                      BEAN
             Actually I'm not a...

                                    DAVID
            That's right - Whistler's Mother. Looking at his mother - not his
            father - not interested in his father, Couldn't give a flying
            doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother. Yes.


                                   GRIERSON
            Well, good - think I may go and look at her myself...


                                                                               67


                                     DAVID
            No!

                                   GRIERSON
            Er ... pray tell me why?

                                    ELMER
            Because they've just cut her into tiny pieces, sir.     That's why.

BEAN and DAVID die and go to hell until ELMER laughs at his own little joke.
GRIERSON laughs too.

                                    ELMER
            I better continue my rounds, sir..

He strolls away.

                                    DAVID
            The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very
            thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel
            the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.

                                   GRIERSON
            Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?

                                     DAVID
            Exactly.   She's in a surprisingly terrible state.    Isn't she,
            Bean?

                                     BEAN
            Oh yes.

                                    DAVID
            Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of
            paints ....

BEAN hudders at the thought of his paint-choosing.

The colours are beginning to fade. However ~     if you give me just one little
year I can restore the picture to its original    glory, the way it looked when
Whistler's Mom first looked at it and said....    0 Actually I'm not sure you've
got the hair right, darling." By the way, your    hair is looking great today,
sir.

                                                                               68

                                    GRIERSON
            Thank you David.   However, flattery will get you nowhere.    Truth

             is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.
             Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and
             short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...

                                        DAVID
             ... you have to sack me.     I understand, sir.    I'll go quietly.     In
             fact I'll go right now.

                                    GRIERSON
             No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've
             decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.

DAVID lets out a little yelp.

                                    GRIERSON
             Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective       buyer - the current
             Governor of California, no less, who is flies      in tomorrow to
             inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the       news. I think
             decisive leadership has done the trick, don't      you?

                                       DAVID
             Yes, sir.   Yes, sir.   Congratulations. Marvellous thing.     Bravo.

 GRIERSON leaves.    DAVID turns to BEAN.

                                        DAVID
             Bean.   Do you drink?

BEAN shakes his head.

                                        DAVID
              Neither do I.

                                                                            CUT TO:


INT.   BAR - NIGHT

It is very late and very gloomy. Just a couple of loners staring into their
drinks. The BARTENDER is up one end of the counter, smoking and reading the
sports pages. There is a T.V. on above the bar, showing baseball.

                                                                                   69

BEAN and DAVID are sitting up at the bar. The latter has had far too much
whisky and looks the worse for it. BEAN has a tall glass packed with fruit
and paper umbrellas. We can guess how much he's had to drink by the way he
has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth. DAVID almost, but not quite,
slurs his words:

                                     DAVID
             It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job -
             lose you wife ... C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean?

He turns to BEAN who has the end of a straw up his nose.

                                        DAVID
             I guess not.

He fills his glass from a bottle.

            You know, I don't get it. The New Artist     exhibition-this year -
            people might not all have liked the dead    sheep, but ... the place
            didn't look that empty to me. It wasn't     full but I saw people. I
            just don't understand how the gallery can    be so bankrupt they have
            to sell the Whistler.

He looks at BEAN who now has peanuts in each nostril.
DAVID notices the BARTENDER looking at BEAN strangely ....

                                      DAVID
            He's English, okay?    You wanna make something of it?

BARTENDER goes back to reading. DAVID searches for his last train of thought,
taking a huge swig from his drink.

                                    DAVID
            ... To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an
            artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a
            figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then,
            I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the
            problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before
            I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels.

                                                                                 70


BEAN at that moment is keen to show DAVID his nut trick. He throws a peanut
high into the air - and catches it in his mouth. Then does two. Then does it
with his eyes closed. Actually, it's rather impressive.

                                    DAVID
             Truth is, I disappointed her. I turned out to have no spine.
             Spineless. A kind of medical miracle. Mr Flippy-Floppy. I
             just don't seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself.
             Too nice. I mean, I should never have let you come stay and I
             should be handing you over to the police right now. Shall I
             tell you something, Beanie ...

Bean has been interested all this, even looking to    check whether David does
indeed have no spine. But now the baseball on the     TV is making it hard for
him to concentrate on-this important confidence.     He raises a finger, for
DAVID to be quiet for a second. He blows a peanut     from his, nostril at the
T.V. - it hits the button, and changes station to    a pleasant quiet-music
station.

                                    DAVID
             Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is?

 BEAN nods his head, very curious, listening hard.

             This is it. Because you moved into my house, my wife has left
             me. She might have done it anyway - but you were the ten ton
             weight that broke the camel's spinal column.

BEAN stares at DAVID - something is getting in he's actually registering this.

             That's point one. And point two - is that you've destroyed
             Whistler's Mother, which was' the last hope for the place where
             I work. So within a week, I'm going to lose my job as well.

BEAN nods, seriously dispirited.

                                                                                 71

                                     DAVID
             So, you've totally and utterly destroyed my life. Do you
             understand? You've put me in a position where it would have been
             better if I'd never been born.

He puts his hand on BEAN'S shoulder.     BEAN looks down.

Very sad. This is actually the first time in his life that he's realised that
his actions have really effected the life of another person. BEAN looks up
sadly. Sad music plays.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   LEARY HOUSE.   DAVID'S ROOM - NIGHT

DAVID is asleep in bed.     The camera moves out into the hall and into BEAN's
room.


INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    BEAN'S ROOM- NIGHT.

BEAN is lying, fully dressed, in the darkness, on his back. Thinking.
Worried by what he's heard. Then suddenly an idea comes into his eyes.      The
music is like his brain He jumps off the bed.

There follows a version of the classic tooling up for action sequence. But
the 'tools' here are distinctly bizarre. BEAN picks up his suitcase, and in
quick cuts, rushes through the house and collects....

DAVID'S PLASTIC KEY CARD
A PAIR OF Y-FRONTS

A TORCH.
SOME OF KEVIN'S CHEWING GUM. 6 EGGS
A COOKING BASIN
A CUP
A LARGE PAINT BRUSH
A BOTTLE OF CLEAR NAIL VARNISH DAVID'S LARGE TIN OF LAXATIVE.     A HAIR DRIER
AN ACTION MAN DOLL
A POSTER OF THE GIRL AND HER BOTTOM WITH THE TENNIS BALL.

TWO OVEN GLOVES
A SKATEBOARD
AND 4 VOLUMES OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA.
Fully tooled, he snaps the suitcase shut.
                                                                         CUT TO:


                                                                                 72


EXT.   GALLERY.   NIGHT.

The building is floodlit by ground spots.

BEAN arrives silently, with suitcase, on the skateboard. Soon his full plan
will be revealed. The Gallery is empty, apart from the one Security Guard,

BUCK, visible through the glass front of the building, drinking coffee,
watching his 12 security monitors. BEAN swallows at the sight of BUCK - he is
a massive gorilla of a man.

                                                                            CUT TO:


INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.    RECEPTION - NIGHT.

BUCK is casually watching his screens, when suddenly, horror of horror, the
huge silhouette of a person hanging .themselves from a tree outside appears,
the shadow of the limp body thrown across the floodlit gallery wall. BUCK
frantically rushes out. And BEAN subtly slips in.

                                                                            CUT TO:


EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT.

BUCK is looking for the body amongst the trees. He finds nothing. Because he
fails to notice the tiny ACTION MAN swinging gently in front of one of the
ground-level floodlights.

                                                                            CUT TO:


INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT'.

Inside, BEAN is casually pouring the entire       contents of DAVID's large laxative
tin into BUCK's coffee. He also swaps two        keys on the board of keys by the
desk. He then takes the opportunity to put        the oven gloves on his feet, one
shaped like a pig, one like a crocodile, so       he can move silently.

BUCK returns. He sits down, and takes a long gulp of coffee. Pause. BEAN
watches. BUCK feels something uncomfortable in his stomach. He takes a key
from his rack of keys, and sets off and rounds a corner- On a monitor screen,
BEAN watches him break into a canter - as he passes through another monitor
BUCK is at full sprint. BEAN giggles.

BEAN is satisfied he'll be uninterrupted for a while. He goes to the key-
rack, borrows two keys, and sets off on his mission. The next 3 minutes of
film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios:

                                                                                 73


FIRST: BUCK - his next 10    minutes    are not happy ones. When he reaches the
toilet, the key he chose    does not    unlock it. He has to sprint back, grab all
the keys, and charge back    again to    the door. Then he has to try out every
single key. We never see     him find    the right one.

SECOND scenario - all the    activities of the night shown on the security
monitors. BUCK sprinting     desperately through shot - BEAN casually going about
his business and, on one    occasion, BUCK running right past BEAN, but not
seeing him - he has other    things on his mind.

THIRD scenario - we actually see BEAN's Big Plan.

He unlocks the merchandise shop. So he can see properly and have his hands
free, he puts the y-fronts on his head, and wedges the torch into them, like a
head-lamp. He then takes a poster of Whistler's Mother and replaces it with

the rolled-up Tennis Ball Girl. He unrolls the Whistler and places the 4
encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down.

He separates the yokes from the eggs, mixes the whites with clear nail varnish
and varnishes the-poster with it. Dries it off with the hair drier.

,With the now stiff poster, he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the
Whistler Room itself, all the time chewing gum frantically. Once there, he
unlocks the final cupboard with David's plastic key, takes the Whistler down
and removes the destroyed Mother from its gilded frame, and its wooden support
frame. He uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame.

He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and
relocks it with DAVID's key card.

The job is done.     He scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin,
and heads off.

                                                                           CUT TO:

EXT. STREET.    NIGHT-

BEAN zipping along on the skate board with his suitcase.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.      UTILITY ROOM - NIGHT.

BUCK, trouserless, is sitting, reading a newspaper next to a noisy washing
machine.

                                                                           CUT TO:

                                                                                74


INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.      BEAN'S ROOM.    NIGHT.   KITCHEN - DAY

BEAN lies back in bed with quiet satisfaction.

                                                                           CUT TO:


INT.   DAVID'S ROOM.      MORNING.

DAVID wakes with a violent start.

                                       DAVID
               0 my God. Tell it vas a dream.

 The door swings open.       It is Bean with a tray of coffee and toast.

                                            BEAN
               Morning.


                                       DAVID
               It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them
               Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.

                                            BEAN

            Well, Ahm....

 He laughs cheerily.

                                         DAVID
            What?

                                                                           CUT TO:


 INT.   DAVID'S CAR.

 Bean is still chuckling.

                                                                           CUT TO:


 INT.   GALLERY.    CORRIDOR.

 Still highly amused, BEAN      guides DAVID in the direction of Whistler's Room.
 David takes out his key to      open the room - but the door swings open. DAVID
 is shocked. There stands       GRIERSON, looking straight at Whistler's Mum. In
 all its untorn, unsmudged,      undestroyed glory.

                                                                                75

                                   GRIERSON
            I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever
            looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.

                                         DAVID
            Ahm....

                                  GRIERSON
            Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?       Don't want
            anything to go wrong.

                                         DAVID
            Quite right, sir.

Grierson leaves.    David gets close to the painting and peers ....

                                         DAVID
            Wait a minute.

BEAN just puts his finger to his mouth...

                                         BEAN
            Ssshhhh.

He lets out a hug smile - he can solve the problems of the world, as well as
create them.


INT. THE LEARY HOUSE. HALL- SATURDAY

JENNIFER skips down t-he stairs, carrying a trendy duffel bag, just as DAVID
enters from the kitchen.

                                       JENNIFER
            Bye, Dad.

                                     DAVID
             Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.    Jen?

But JENNIFER has already reached the front door ....

                                      JENNIFER
             Be serious, Dad.    It's Saturday.

She exits.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                                                                               76


EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY

JENNIFER is heading down the path.    DAVID runs out of the house and catches up
with her.

                                     DAVID
             Jen, you have to help me here! I've got to go in to work, and
             with your mom away ... I really need you.

A powerful motorbike turns into the drive at speed and skids round to face the
opposite direction. JENNIFER runs over to it. The bike's rider turns off his
engine and removes his helmet. It is STINGO, the white Rasta from the
airport, with the hair extensions and the sixty rings in his nose.

                                      STINGO
                                    (to DAVID)
             You.

He hands JENNIFER a helmet.

                                      JENNIFER
             Don't worry, Dad.    I'll be home. Monday, after school.

BEAN and KEVIN arrive at DAVID's side to spectre.

                                     KEVIN
             Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna
             look just like its handsome driver.

                                     DAVID
                                  (angry now)
             Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this
             family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!
             Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable.

JENNIFER has put on the helmet and is climbing onto the back of the bike.

                                    JENNIFER
             Great, Dad. You promised you'd get rid of him! (points at Bean)
             And as for: "how we do things in this family. We don't have a
             family till you get Mom back.

                                                                               77

She slaps STINGO on the shoulder.    STINGO kicks the starter lever.    Nothing.

Again.     Nothing ...


                                        JENNIFER
               Come on Sting!

                                        KEVIN
               Sting?!   Sounds like something you put on a rash.

STINGO is still kicking the starter.       DAVID is desperate.

                                       DAVID
               Don't just stand there, Bean - do something.

BEAN instantly takes on the hero's mantle and runs to the bike. DAVID is not
far behind him. STINGO is still trying to kick start it. BEAN takes out a
small screwdriver and twiddles with something on the engine.

The bike sparks into life and does a wheelie before speeding out of the drive
and down the road. BEAN stands, hands on hips, looking very-pleased with
himself indeed.

                                          DAVID
                To BEAN )    Right! Right! You get inside and look after Kevin!
                (not such    a good idea) Uh --- Right! Kevin. You get inside and
                look after    ... uh... (that would be a worse idea) Right! Get in
                the car!     Both of you. Jesus!

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.     THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    RECEPTION AREA - DAY

DAVID, BEAN and KEVIN at the reception desk.

                                         ANNIE
               So, Kevin.    How's it going?

                                         KEVIN
               Badly.    You wanna adopt me?

ANNIE smiles cutely at BEAN.       DAVID is still rattled.


                                          ANNIE
                Big day today, huh?
                                                                                  78

                                          DAVID
                Uh ... yes ...

DAVID looks askance at BEAN.       BERNIE hurries up and takes DAVID to one side.

                                       BERNIE
                Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and
                concentrating on the future.

                                       DAVID
                Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.      I'm sure we
                haven't been doing as badly as all that.

                                         BERNIE

              You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love
              you. (he hugs him and laughs). Jesus - what a terrible tie-
              Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a
              little surprise for you and the Boss.

 DAVID calls to ANNIE.

                                     DAVID
              Annie ... would you look after Kevin? And Kevin - you look after
              Bean.

He heads off with BERNIE.     Back at the counter.   BEAN, KEVIN & ANNIE.

                                     KEVIN
             My Dad told me all about you.

                                       ANNIE
             Did he now?

                                     KEVIN
              He says you've got a babe count of ten out of ten, and a brain
              cell count of about two and a half.

                                     ANNIE
              Yeah, I'll go with that. I'm kinda, like, dumb, intellectually.
              (to Bean) But I'm great in bed.

BEAN is unsettled by this.     He gives a shudder and heads for the gallery.

                                                                                 79


                                     KEVIN
             Catch you later, babe.(goes after Bean) Come on, Beanie - there
             must be a computer here somewhere. I hate paintings. They don't
             do anything.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.    DAY.

BERNIE, DAVID and GRIERSON. BERNIE looks very confident at a computer
monitor. A painting is in fact 'doing' something, on the computer screen, as
the girls in a Toulouse-Lautrec painting actually dance the can-can.

                                      GRIERSON
             Well, congratulations.    Isn't that great, David?

                                       DAVID
             Certainly is.

                                     BERNIE
             We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to
             every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the
             Governor.

                                   GRIERSON
             Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a
             winning team.

DAVID slightly embarrassed not to be included in the winning team.      He looks

to the poster of Whistler's Mother behind GRIERSON's desk.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY

KEVIN and BEAN have found a computer,    also showing BERNIE's Gallery programme.
The monitor shows the interior of the    ground floor of the gallery. KEVIN
clicks, and up comes the same Toulouse    Lautrec picture. As KEVIN works the
mouse, BEAN hums the catchy tune from    'GOBLINS 21. It's play time again.

                                     KEVIN
              This is way cool, Beanie.

He clicks again, and a tiny talking Toulouse Lautrec starts to explain the
provenance of the painting.

                                                                              80

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   THE WHISTLER ROOM. DAY

DAVID is overseeing things. There's a burgundy rope, keeping people a bit
away from the case in which Whistler's Mother is contained. ELMER brings in
two large flower displays. BERNIE enters.

                                     BERNIE
             Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only person round here who
             actually gets things done.

He exits. BERNIE is growing in confidence - and getting nastier by the
minute. DAVID pulls a face at ELMER.

                                     DAVID
             You arrange those flowers yourself?

                                      ELMER
             Sure did.

                                      DAVID
             They're pretty.   Learn it in the army?

                                     ELMER
             No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands,
             you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY

The final touches in the preparation for the big visit to up-tempo, "we're
getting ready" music.

1.    Gardeners gardening, window cleaners cleaning, polishers polishing etc.
And someone empties a dustbin, in the midst of which we glimpse something
which might be a scrunched up old Whistler painting.

2.    BERNIE watches as someone plugs in a plug - and a huge video screen in
the gallery flickers and starts up.

3.    ANNIE at her counter, reading a book called 'The Art of Conversational.
She shakes an imaginary hand and rehearses a keen conversation with an
imaginary V.I.P.

                                                                                81

4.    ELMER, in the men's room mirror, trims his hair around his peaked hat
with scissors. He has a row of war medals on his chest. He polishes them
proudly with his sleeve.

5.    GRIERSON watches through the front glass - a red carpet rolls itself out
from the gallery's main entrance to stop by the rear door of a black car.

                                                                         CUT TO:


EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY

Close on the bottom    of the black cars rear door. It opens and a pair of legs,
wearing black shoes    and charcoal trousers, step out onto the red carpet. As
they walk purposely    up the carpet, the camera pans up their owner's body, to
reveal that this is    BERNIE. It's a rehearsal. He is met with a hand shake by
GRIERSON at the main    entrance.

                                    GRIERSON
             What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of
             our staff here. (checks a prompt card).

                                     BERNIE
             And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.

                                      GRIERSON
             Right.    Got it.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.     RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Gallery staff wait, all wearing name badges. GRIERSON leads BERNIE to the
reception counter. ANNIE steps out from behind it and shakes BERNIE's hand.

                                     ANNIE
             Good day, Governor Reynolds. I'm Annie ...

                                       BERNIE
             Curtsy.

                                     ANNIE
             Curtsy? Are you kidding? This is 1990s America.      Women don't
             curtsy, they run the damn country!

                                                                                82



                                      GRIERSON
           Alex, please!

                                       ANNIE
           That's Annie, sir.

GRIERSON takes BERNIE on to ELMER who is next in line.

                                    GRIERSON
             This is Elmer, our longest serving...

                                     BERNIE
             Hey. Let's junk the medals, Elmer. This is not a Veterans'
             reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home. Not remind him
             of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.

ELMER puts on a defiant face. DAVID shakes his head disapprovingly.        GRIERSON
moves BERNIE to meet DAVID. They

'Shake hands.

                                     DAVID
             David Leary. I'd like to echo my colleagues welcome to you and
             thank you for your patronage ...

BERNIE rudely cuts him off.

                                     BERNIE
             Okay, that'll do. The Governor's here in half an hour.       We have
             to be totally ready then. No excuses. Period!

                                    GRIERSON
             Thank you Bernie. Well done. Now, If you'll excuse - I have a
             little smartening up to do myself.

                                                                           CUT TO:


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    BERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

BEAN at the computer. He's actually quite enjoying himself now. In fact,
he's rather hogging the thing. This is, after all, an animated catalogue -
his area.

                                                                                83

                                     KEVIN
             I'm just gonna go see if Annie needs me for anything.      Truth is,
             she smells kinda nice. okay? (grins).

BEAN smiles and gives KEVIN a thumbs-up.       KEVIN returns the gesture and
exits..

Back to the computer, BEAN clicks on an icon which takes him to the ground
floor gallery. He clicks through various paintings and stops at the painting
of the woman, in the castle, wearing the chastity belt. BEAN clicks and
enlarges the painting to fill the screen.

He happily hums the catchy tune from 'GOBLINS 2' and homes in on the tiny
padlock on the chastity belt. Padlocks interest him. He clicks on the
keyhole rapidly (as we have seen him do with the frog in GOBLINS 2).

                                     MR. BEAN

             Click! click! click! click! click!

.Suddenly, to BEAN's surprise, the padlock starts to flash red...then the
whole screen starts to flash ... before going dramatically back to black ...
Now flashing in the .centre of the monitor is an icon of a tiny key. Beneath
it, a row of six dashes appears (e.g - - - - - - - ). A cursor is flashing
over the first dash.

BEAN is totally absorbed. He loves these kinds of puzzles. With one finger,
he slowly types out letters on the keyboard (he has to search for some of
them). As he does so, they appear over each dash in turn:

                                 G-O-B-L-I-N
A message pops up: "ACCESS DENIED" BEAN tries something 0 else.
                                 G-N-O-M-E-S
The message again: `ACCESS DENIED'. The room door suddenly opens! Making
BEAN jump! It's BERNIE. He cannot see the computer screen from the doorway.

                                       BERNIE
         How goes it, Bean?    Ready for the Governor?

BEAN smiles and nods nervously.       He knows he's probably up to something he
shouldn't be.




                                                                                   84


                                    BERNIE
           We need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more.
           Period. Oh, And put this on.

BERNIE throws BEAN a name badge with 'Dr. Bean' on it. BEAN nods. BERNIE
exits. BEAN goes back to the code. He types in the first thing that comes
into his head:

                                      B-E-R-N-I-E

That damned message again: `ACCESS DENIED'.         Then, as though something is
dawning on him, he punches in:

                                      P-E-R-I-0-D

Up comes a message: "CODE ACCEPTED". Close on BEAN's face as light from the
computer plays on it- He reads it carefully and with interest. We cant quite
read his expression - but what he sees is a surprise and a puzzle. Long
meaningful pause as his eyes scan the screen.

                                                                             CUT TO:


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      THE WHISTLER ROOM - DAY

BERNIE enters - DAVID is looking at Whistler's Mother, still puzzled.

                                        BERNIE
             David?   Lift off!

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.     RECEPTION AREA - DAY

The staff and various dignitaries are lined, looking out through the glass in
anticipation. Through the glass we see a couple of Police Motorcycle Escorts
pull up outside followed by a beautiful, old, classic Rolls Royce.

                                                                            CUT TO:


EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY

The red carpet unrolls all the way to the Rolls, rear door. Close on the
bottom of the driver's door. It opens and out step a pair of legs, wearing
army boots and khaki trousers.

                                                                                    85

The legs step sideways onto the carpet and approach us. Camera pans up to
show us that GOVERNOR REYNOLDS is dressed in his Veteran's uniform - chest of
medals and forage cap. He is a grand figure. In fact - he's exactly the same
grand figure Mr BEAN caused epic problems To on the plane over. He gives his
prized possession, the car, a little token polish with his sleeve before
heading on.

BRUTUS and his SIDE-KICK COP fall into step behind him.       They are the Police
presence today.

GRIERSON and BERNIE greet REYNOLDS at the entrance.

GRIERSON is wearing a striking brand new light blue silk suit.       BERNIE is
frowning - not happy about that uniform.

                                    GRIERSON
             what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.

                                    REYNOLDS
             Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.       Going on To my regiment/s
             reunion after.

                                      GRIERSON
             Not at all, Governor.    Very striking.

 REYNOLDS takes in GRIERSON's suit.

                                      REYNOLDS
             Interesting suit.

                                       GRIERSON
                                      (Beaming)
             Why thank you sir.

                                      REYNOLDS
              off the peg?

                                   GRIERSON
                                (crestfallen )
                Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...

He gestures to BERNIE but REYNOLDS cuts in and hands BERNIE a set of car keys.

                                    REYNOLDS
                                  (To Bernie)
             Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son.

BERNIE's smile melts away. As they enter the gallery, BERNIE hopefully offers
the car keys to BRUTUS - who rewards him with a "don't be stupid" smile and
follows the Governor.

                                                                                 86


BEAN (wearing "Dr Bean" name badge) comes into the corridor by the front door,
thus just missing REYNOLDS. BERNIE sees him and jumps on the chance to
delegate.

                                     BERNIE
             Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you.

 BEAN assents happily. BRUTUS spies BEAN over his shoulder and frowns - its
 that mad English guy again. BEAN gets to the door and sees the Governor's
 car. Yummy!

                                                                           CUT TO:
INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   RECEPTION AREA - DAY

GRIERSON leads REYNOLDS to the reception counter, as BERNIE sneaks up to take
his position again. ELMER is in the background trying to look professional,
deferring to BRUTUS.

ANNIE steps out from behind the counter, curtsies and ,shakes REYNOLDS' hand.

                                     ANNIE
             Good day, Governor. I'm Annie.      You know, you're a lot taller
             than you were half an hour ago.

                                    REYNOLDS
             Well, that's great to hear at my age, Annie.      Thank you very much.

                                      ANNIE
             Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have to curtsy?      Or does
             she 0 have a decent job?

                                    REYNOLDS
             Er ... Mrs. Reynolds is doing just fine.      Just fine.

He spots KEVIN and winks at him.      KEVIN smiles back.
                                                               CUT TO:

EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   DAY.

BEAN has let himself into the car. It's one of the happiest moments of his
life, as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather
seat.

                                                                                 87


He starts the car up - and heads up into the circular car park. He sweeps
dangerously round a few turns - but just manages to keep the car in tact.
Finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left.

BEAN is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the
one he's used to.

He takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his Mini, and
measures the space. Yes. Seems large enough. He moves the car in. It isn't
large enough.

With a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the Rolls Royce squeezes in
between the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process.
BEAN looks a tadge concerned.

                                                                                CUT TO:

INT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY.

REYNOLDS has moved on to ELMER who salutes crisply.         REYNOLDS returns the
salute with pride.

                                     REYNOLDS
              Nice set of medals there Elmer.      Which beach they drop you on?
              Utah? Omaha?

                                       ELMER
              Couldn't tell you sir. I was so drugged up with the killing I
              didn't know where I was.

                                     REYNOLDS
              Well, congratulations soldier.
                                                                                CUT TO:

EXT.    PARKING LOT - DAY.

BEAN sitting in the wedged car. He tries       the door - but it won't open a
centimetre. He's totally stuck. He looks        up at a small window in the roof.
If only he could get that open. He pushes      various buttons, which set of
windscreen wipers, squirters, radios. He       pushes the cigarette lighter.
Finally, he pulls a lever - and the bonnet      pops up an inch.

At which moment we see the lighter shoot out, and on to the seat. BEAN is
still looking round below the dashboard, when he notices a little fire in the
seat beside him. Not good news.

                                                                                     88


 BEAN panics a bit, turns and half      climbs over into    the back   seat, when he
 spies a drinks cabinet. He has a       very good idea -    he finds   a cut crystal
 decanter of brown liquid, opens it      and uses it to    douse the   fire. Not a
 wise move with brandy. Before the       cut, we see the    WHOOOSH!   of a major fire
 in the front seat of the car.

                                                                                CUT TO:

 INT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   DAY.

GRIERSON leads REYNOLDS towards the main gallery. He points up to the video
screen they are passing, which shows the two of them walking along - as does
every screen in the gallery. REYNOLDS is impressed. He glances at DAVID in
passing.

                                        REYNOLDS

             Nice tie, fella.

DAVID grins to himself.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   PARKING LOT - DAY.

The front of the car isn't    what it was. There has been a big fire. It's out
now - three decanters lie    empty. BEAN is not happy. Finally, he decides to
go for brute strength. He     turns the car on again, puts it into reverse, and
puts his foot down on the    accelerator.

We see the car from above. Full throttle. Totally still. Totally still.
And then WHOOOOSH WHAM!!! It reverses at 100 mph straight backwards, smashing
violently into and destroying the back of the car behind _ as it happens,
Bernie's car.

                                                                  CUT TO


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    GROUND FLOOR - DAY

REYNOLDS stops to admire a small painting - a twelfth century 'Crucifixion of
Christ'.

                                    GRIERSON
             Ah, one of my favourites. It expresses a universal agony that the
             established Church so rarely acknowledges, don't you think?

                                                                            89
                                    REYNOLDS
             Jesus ... no one's got feet like for crying out loud. Have you
             got feet like that? Dammed if I have. Let's move it, shall we?

BERNIE spots a slightly concerned DAVID.

                                       BERNIE
             Everything okay, David?

                                        DAVID
             Yes. Ahm.      I was just wondering where my English house guest had
             got to.

                                     BERNIE
             He's just parking the Governor's car.

                                     DAVID
             Great - keep him out of trouble.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   PARKING LOT - DAY.

BEAN is inspecting the car. He's not too happy with it. '.He tries to get
the bonnet down, but it insists on staying up. He shrugs his shoulders and
gets in to drive off again, having to wind down the window and drive by
leaning his head out. This means that as he heads for the exit, he fails to
see the system to stop people leaving without paying, a foot high barrier that
appears out of the ground. When he hits it, the car stops dead.

BEAN gets out,    leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where normally the
attendant would    be - but everyone is in the gallery at the moment. Inside he
pushes a couple    of buttons, and, hurrah, gets the one that drops the barrier.
Less hurrah, he    has forgotten to put on the hand brake.

As he moves    back towards the car, it glides slowly down the ramp on the
outside of    the building, then accelerates, and finally, on a particularly
sharp turn,    smashes through the wall, and flies off the building. We hear a
crash - but    do not see where it lands.

                                                                            CUT TO:

GOVERNOR REYNOLDS turns away from another picture.


                                                                                 90

                                     REYNOLDS
              Can we go and see Mrs. Whistler now?      My eyes are making my feet
              sore, as my wife would say.

                                          DAVID
              Sure, Governor.   Please.     This way.

The party follows DAVID as he walks through the gallery, towards the double
doors, to take the lift to the Whistler Room. An excited atmosphere.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   WHISTLER ROOM.    DAY.

Everyone enters.

                                      DAVID
              Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen Whistler's Mother
              before, can I ask you just to step back. Thank you.

It's part of his plan of caution - he knows there's something wrong - and
wants as few people as possible to .see the painting close up. The crowd
moves back.

                                      DAVID
              I'd like the Governor to have, as it were, a private audience with
              his new friend.

REYNOLDS is flattered. Silence. DAVID inserts the plastic card key - opens
the doors - and sure enough there in all its glory is Whistler's Mother'.
Respectful silence.

REYNOLDS is delighted.     He stands back to inspect her.

                                     REYNOLDS
              Well, hello Ma'am! Yes - she certainly looks a million dollars to
              me - or should I say ten million dollars!

Everyone applauds.

                                     GRIERSON
              Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of, though I say it

             myself, rather 'expensive' champagne. (grins smugly)

                                                                               91

People start to file out. REYNOLDS, GRIERSON, BERNIE and DAVID stay behind.
DAVID spots BEAN arriving. He hands the car keys back to BERNIE with a
slightly dazed smile. DAVID eagerly takes his arm and brings him over.

                                     DAVID
             Governor, I don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from
             England.

They turn to each other - recognition from BEAN "it's the man from the plane".
He does a very quick hand-shake and tries to make a getaway before REYNOLDS
recognises him...

                                      BEAN
             Ah, hello, sorry, I ... Ahm... sorry ...

BEAN turns. In fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops anyone
getting too close to the great painting. He spins and falls in the direction
of the painting.

CUT TO: the looks of horror on all the faces.

CUT TO: BEAN, reaching out to keep himself standing. We think he's going to
tear the painting. He doesn't. He simply catches hold of the bottom of the
ornate frame. It ,,snaps off.

CUT TO: a look of relief for an instant on all faces.

CUT TO: the truth - as the frame breaks off, there is the little white strip,
saying, THE GRIERSON GALLERY, HOME OF WHISTLER'S MOTHER"-

CUT TO: a look of horror on all faces.

CUT TO: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK glowering at BEAN.
                                                                       CUT TO:

INT.   GALLERY CORRIDOR.   DAY.

Governor REYNOLDS storming through the Gallery, with -BERNIE and GRIERSON
scampering after him.

                                    REYNOLDS
             You were going to sell the State of California a poster - for ten
             million dollars! Who the hell do you think you are, Shorty!?

                                                                               92



                                    GRIERSON
             Look, Governor - just wait - it's may not be as bad as it looks
             ....

                                                                       CUT TO:

INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      WHISTLER ROOM - DAY.

DAVID and BEAN stand alone in silence, in front of the debris. BEAN is
absolutely destitute. DAVID stares at him. BEAN just lifts his hands.
Totally sad. What will, what can DAVID say to him? Finally, DAVID just puts
his hands on his shoulder.

                                        DAVID
             Nice try, kiddo.

BEAN cant quite believe he's forgiven. At which moment, there is a knock on
the door. ANNIE enters, holding KEVIN's hand.

                                      ANNIE
             David.   There's a call for you.    It's your wife.

                                    DAVID
             Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a
             date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later.

Then he notices the worried expressions on ANNIE and KEVIN's faces.

                                      ANNIE
                       She's calling from the hospital ...

BEAN and DAVID both take this in.      DAVID turns and runs towards the reception
area. ANNIE calls after him.

                                        ANNIE
             She's on line three!

KEVIN grabs BEAN's hand and they both run after DAVID.      ANNIE watches BEAN go
and sighs.

                                        ANNIE
             Such... great buns.

                                                                          CUT TO:

INT.   GALLERY ENTRANCE HALL.   DAY.

The party is in disarray. In the background, DAVID is on the phone at the
reception counter with KEVIN and BEAN. BRUTUS hovers, he suspects BEAN -
wants to question him.

                                    REYNOLDS
             I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more
             intelligent than you two. Not only have you failed to protect
             your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even
             know it'd been stolen! I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who
             sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you
             guys.

                                    GRIERSON
             I am sorry you feel that way.

                                    REYNOLDS
             And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.     That suit stinks and
             you obviously dye your hair.

GRIERSON is seriously shocked and offended.

             Now, bring my car round the front please - I've had enough of this
             crap!.

                                         BERNIE
             Certainly, sir.

He rushes off. Meanwhile, DAVID slams down the phone and he, BEAN and KEVIN
rush out of the building. ELMER, BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK give chase.

                                                                              CUT TO:

EXT.   GALLERY PARKING LOT.     DAY.

DAVID's car screeches out onto the street and tears away.

BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK arrive, flustered, at their car.        SIDE-KICK is
frantically searching for its keys.

                                         BRUTUS
             Come on man!     Move it!

A car passes by them slowly.      ELMER is driving.   He shouts from his window.

                                                                                   94

                                          ELMER
             Hey, Cop, wanna ride?       Jeese, where do they get you guys?

The cops jump in his car while it is still moving.

                                                                              CUT TO:

EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY

REYNOLDS at the entrance.      BERNIE walks up sheepishly, holding up car keys.

                                     BERNIE
             There is one other tiny problem, sir.
                                                                              CUT TO:

EXT.   STREET.   DAY.

DAVID's car speeds by.      ELMER's car is not far behind it.
                                                                              CUT TO:

INT.   DAVID'S CAR - DAY

DAVID is driving fast.
                                          KEVIN
             Is Jenny gonna be okay?

                                     DAVID
             She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.

                                     KEVIN
             But is she gonna be okay?

                                          DAVID
                                       (snapping)

             How the hell should I know?

KEVIN is hurt.

             I'm sorry. What can I say - she's unconscious. And I mean -
             every night when we sleep, we're all unconscious, aren't we?
             She'll pull out of it. God though - why the hell do kids have to
             ride bikes?

DAVID slams on the brakes.     He nearly went through a red light.

                                                                              95

                                     DAVID
             Damn! She's a good kid. Sometimes good people get a break once
             in a while. (manages a smile)

A chauffeur driven, open top limo, pulls up next to DAVID's car. BEAN looks
out of his window to see the BAG LADY, from the mall robbery, sitting in the
back. She is still wearing her filthy clothes. She raises a glass of
champagne to BEAN and smiles.

BEAN waves back uncertainly.     He's sure he's seen her before - a vague memory.

CUT TO: ELMER's CAR is in the traffic queue about ten cars back. BRUTUS and
SIDE-KICK get out and start running down the line towards DAVID's car.

The lights are green. DAVID puts his foot down and the car screeches away
just as BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK are within inches it.

CUT TO: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK turn on their heels and head back to ELMER's car.
They are very unfit.

They are just about to jump in the car when gun shots are heard from a near-by
gas station- BRUTUS turns and sees a .robbery in progress. A man with a gun
is about to run away. BRUTUS is torn, not knowing which quarry to pursue.

                                      BRUTUS

             Shiiiit!

                                       ELMER
             It's okay!    I'll tail 'em!

                                      BRUTUS
             You got it.

BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK draw their guns and run towards the gas station. In a
moment of confusion - a shot rings out. We think in the corner of our eye
that we see BRUTUS fall to the ground, as ELMER screeches away after DAVID's
car.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.   RECEPTION - DAY

Much hustle and bustle. DAVID is getting directions from a nurse at the desk.
He beckons to KEVIN and BEAN and strides, purposely towards a corridor. They
hurry to catch him up, and Bean treat on the back of his shoe. DAVID turns
and shouts at him.

                                                                               96


                                      DAVID
           Just stay away from me!   D'you hear?

He takes KEVIN's hand and storms away round a corner. BEAN is taken aback not
knowing what to do or where to go. He is really feeling sorrow now. He's
shaken. All part of his slow coming to feel things properly.

                                                                       CUT TO:


INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - DAY

DAVID and KEVIN turns a corner - and stop, frozen. There, sitting alone, on a
bench, outside JENNIFER's room, is ALISON. She gets to her feet. Their eyes
meet.

                                                                       CUT TO:


EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY -DAY

A crowd outside the gallery, look off camera. The camera follows BERNIE's
gaze and takes in the modern car sculpture. Where there were two cars face
down in the earth, there are now three, the new addition being Governor's
pride and Joy. The three cars form a tall pyramid.

Close on REYNOLDS' face. GRIERSON approaches.

                                    REYNOLDS
               Don't even think of saying one word to me, or I'11 find a way
               of fitting all three of those cars right up your ass.

  GRIERSON nods - he's got the message.

                                                                       CUT TO:



INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR. DAY

ALISON and DAVID are standing where they were before, three paces apart.
ALISON is upset, tired and drawn.

                                     ALISON
             They're not calling it a coma. The doctor says she's ... just
             kind of taking time out. (to Kevin) Hi, tough guy. (to David) It's
             a busy night. The doctor will be back in a while.

  A doctor passes

                                                                               97

                                     DAVID
             Excuse me.

                                    DOCTOR 1
             I'll be back in a minute.

                                           DAVID
              Okay, great.

 ALISON looks at him. We don't quite read the expression but somewhere under
 there we know she's thinking "yup, he's still ineffective."

                                     ALISON
              At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.

                                           DAVID
              Ah, well ....

BEAN is looking for his friends.        A doctor sweeps by him.   A nurse behind.

                                           NURSE
              Doctor Jacobson?

             Yes?

                                     NURSE
             We need you urgently in C Theatre.

                                   DOCTOR JACOBSON
             Damn.     I was just going to Number 4 ....

                                           NURSE
             It is urgent, sir.

                            DOCTOR JACOBSON
             Okay.....

The doctor rushes away and drops his stethoscope as he .goes.         BEAN sees it,
picks it up and follows him he's trying to be useful.

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.     RECEPTION - DAY

ELMER is at the busy reception desk and has been talking with a nurse.

                                     ELMER
             No, no, I didn't realise the situation.       I won't disturb them now.

ELMER is obviously moved to find out about JENNIFER. He moves towards the
exit ... He is surprised to see BUCK, the night-shift guard, dressed in
civvies, sitting with outpatients.

                                           ELMER
             Buck?

BUCK looks up, painfully, goes to say something, then dashes into a men's room
close-by. ELMER shakes his head and leaves.

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - DAY.

BEAN still following DR JACOBSON, who goes through more swing doors and then
suddenly disappears. BEAN sees a big "4" above a door and goes in, holding
the Stethoscope. A nurse accosts him instantly. She reads his name badge.

                                       NURSE 2
             Doctor ... Bean?

BEAN is fed up trying to correct people with this misconception.

                                      BEAN
              Actually ... (huge sigh) ... Yes, yes, yes...

                                       NURSE 2
              Just in time, sir.     Allow me.

She immediately slips the white coat onto BEAN, and the gloves, and the mask.

INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - DAY

ALISON, DAVID and KEVIN are sitting on the bench opposite JENNIFER's room.
KEVIN picks up JENNIFER's SUPER NINTENDO console from the bench. DAVID
notices this. ALISON answers his look.

                                                                             99

                                    ALISON
           When the Police told me what had happened I ... it's stupid I know
           ... but I remembered all that stuff people do to get through to
           coma victims ...

                                     KEVIN
           Like playing them recordings of their dish washers and coffee
           grinders?

                                     ALISON
           That right.   So I went home and picked it up.

                                     DAVID
           Good thinking. (pause) You still call it 'home'.

ALISON looks at him seriously.


INT.   OPERATING THEATRE.   NIGHT.

Inside the operating theatre, a body is waiting in position. There are 3
attending nurses and an assistant doctor. They all look up to BEAN as he
enters, fully kitted up.

                                   ASSISTANT
             Good evening Doctor.. What we have here is a bullet wound in the
             lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's
             severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.

                                       NURSE 2
             He's coming round.

                                   ASSISTANT
             Give him a T 70, straight away.

The victim starts to move - he looks up - we see his face for the first time.
It is the police officer, BRUTUS. He is in great pain. As the sedative shot
goes in, BEAN takes off his mask, and smiles, with a little wave. A look of
total panic goes over BRUTU'S eyes, as he loses consciousness.

                                   ASSISTANT
              Shall I do the cut, sir?

BEAN nods - he's not going to argue with anyone. The assistant cuts. BEAN is
horrified, almost faints, then snatches the knife. He can't believe this
maniac has just cut through another personas flesh.

                                                                             100


                                   ASSISTANT
             I'm sorry. it's only MY first week.

BEAN hands the knife to the NURSE testily.

                                     NURSE
             I'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the X-rays, Doctor, or we'll
             never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort out the support
             systems.

EVERYONE turns to get on    with their particular jobs. BEAN is left with the
body. A pause. He gets      a little bored. Takes a sweet packet out of his
pocket. Only one sweet     left. he takes it out lovingly, and then does what he
always does - throws it    up into the air, to catch it in his mouth.

Unfortunately, he forgets that he is wearing a mask.     It hits the middle of
the mask and bounces into the cut in the body.

BEAN looks down annoyed. Checks round him - everyone's 'still busy. So he
puts his hand in the body, really rummages around, finds the sweet, takes it
out, and then realises he's in fact got the bullet between his fingers.
..Guiltily, he slips it back into the body, rummages a bit more, finds the
sweet, wipes it, & pops it in his mouth. At which second the X-ray arrives.

                                   ASSISTANT
              Here we go, doctor. ( STUDYING THE X-RAY ) the bullet is here -
              so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here. Think we all
              better be prepared for a long one here. This is tricky.

BEAN tuts scornfully - 'you're wrong 1, reaches in again, feels around for a
second, and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers.

They all applaud.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.    CORRIDOR - DAY.

BEAN exits from the theatre - still in gown and mask, followed by the
assistant. The police SIDE-KICK is waiting.

                                   SIDE-KICK
             Any news on the chief?.

                                                                                101

                                    ASSISTANT
            There certainly is.    Dr Bean here just saved his life.

SIDE-KICK's eyes water. He's choked. BEAN shakes his hand nervously, and
heads on fast before he's found out. He turns the corner and suddenly sees
DAVID and ALISON, still seated. ALISON sees him.

                          ALISON
            0 my god.

                                    DAVID
             Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.

                                    ALISON
            Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?

She turns her head away: the bond of the moments before is gone.       BEAN looks
very contrite. At that moment, another doctor walks by.

                                      DAVID
            Excuse me.

                                   DOCTOR 2
            Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute.    We have a lot to
            deal with here, sir.

ALISON looks round, and shakes her head. BEAN kicks DAVID in the shins.
DAVID looks round, puzzled. There is a poster of the human skeleton. BEAN
points to the spine. DAVID looks but cannot fathom a relevant meaning from
it.

Another doctor comes along - the same one who they spoke to first.       He's
young, confident slightly arrogant.

                                     ALISON
            Excuse me, doctor.

                                    DOCTOR
            Really Ma'am, we'll get to you in due course.

                                     ALISON
            Okay.

DAVID looks at the poster opposite again. Spine, ribcage, skull. Looks back
at Bean gesturing to it. This time the penny drops! Spine spineless!

                                                                                102

                                      DAVID
            Say that again, son.

                                     DOCTOR
            I beg your pardon?

                                    DAVID
            I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll
            make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less
            healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.

                                       DOCTOR
               I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.

                                       DAVID
               We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the
               Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end
               of the world.

A hint of a smile arrives on ALISON's lips. She's heard that somewhere before.

                                                DAVID
               So,    why not haul    your    ... (checks) nice little ass into this room
               and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going
               to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence
               and    attention you    are    going to give her case.

                                               DOCTOR
               Okay, sir.        Certainly.    Good.

DAVID turns to ALISON - she does a little tilt of her
Head `WOW'. And he turns to BEAN, who points to
himself,    and nods .... n Come on!

                                       DAVID
               Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will
               you?

 BEAN nods enthusiastically and backs off.

                                               ALISON
                 Smiling         Well, well.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                                                                                      103
INT.     HOSPITAL.    JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Close on an E.C.G. monitor, green lines on black screen. DAVID and ALISON sit
by JENNIFER's bed. JENNIFER is unconscious. She has her arm in a cast and a
small Band-Aid on her head. otherwise she seems undamaged.

KEVIN    is sitting on the end of the bed playing the SUPER NINTENDO game (the
Gothic    Vampire thing, with bats and he-men, we saw on JENNIFER'S TV earlier).
It is    plugged into a T.V. which sits on a trolley. It's quite a noisy game.
KEVIN    is immersed in it.

                                               ALISON
               Let's get a coffee.

                                             DAVID
               Yes.     Great.     Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.

ALISON exits. David follows. BEAN enters.               He sees JENNIFER for the first
time. Sympathy shows in his eyes.

                                       KEVIN
               Help me with this. It's a scientific experiment. We're gonna
               wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire
               bats.

BEAN is determined to help. He sits down with KEVIN. The game continues.
The he-man jumps up and down, lashing out at bats with his sword. Lots of
noise, but JENNIFER sleeps on.

                                                                          CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - NIGHT

By a drinks machine.    ALISON finishes drinking from a plastic cup.

                                       ALISON
             Disgusting.

She looks up at DAVID, who's looking at her.     Slowly she gets close and puts
her arms around him. She's a bit tearful.

                                     DAVID
             Everything's gonna be fine.

                                        ALISON
                                       (pause)
             About Charles...

                                                                              104


                                        DAVID
             shhh...

                                     ALISON
              It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh.      When was
              the last time we laughed? Any of us?

                                     DAVID
              I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular
              proportions. Olympic standard.

                                        KEVIN
              Dad...

 They look down to see KEVIN has arrived.

                                     KEVIN
              These guys just hijacked the T.V. Me and Bean were trying to ...

 A hospital PORTER passes, pushing the T.V. on a trolley.

                                HOSPITAL PORTER
              Sorry, folks. We're short on these and there's another kid down
              the hall that could use ...

                                     DAVID
              Wait a minute .... (about to get tough again)

                                        ALISON
              Please. It's okay.      Really. (to David) Wow - who put the fire
              in you, my' man?

                                                                          CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.   JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT

JENNIFER is still asleep. BEAN is sitting on the end of her bed. He looks at
the SUPER NINTENDO console thinking, "How can I get this working again? How
can I help?" The only sound in the room is the beeping from the E.C.G.
machine, monitoring Jennifer's heart. BEAN has an idea.

He yanks off the jack plug at the end of the Super Nintendo lead.        Producing
his small screwdriver, he starts to unscrew the console casing.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.     CORRIDOR - NIGHT

DAVID, ALISON and KEVIN walk back towards the room.

                                     ALISON
             Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.

                                     DAVID
             Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.

She and DAVID manage to share a smile. They're going to get through this.
Suddenly, we hear noise from the vampire game, coming from JENNIFER's room.
KEVIN registers this and is puzzled. Then ALISON and DAVID notice it.

                                         DAVID
             I thought you said....
                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.     JENNIFER'S ROOM - DAY

The LEARYS appear in the open doorway.       Their expressions turn from curiosity
to horror.

BEAN has plugged the SUPER NINTENDO games system into the       back of JENNIFER's
E.C.G. monitor. A couple of bats are flapping about the        screen but the most
worrying thing here (shown in close-up) is the sight of a       he-man type, jumping
up and down, lashing out, with his sword, at the passing       pulse light, showing
Jennifer's faint vital signs ...

ALISON gasps.      DAVID slowly moves into the room.

                                     DAVID
             Now, Bean ... just put down that thing ... nice and slow ... you
             hear me? Come on now...

But BEAN is determined to keep going - it's his way of reviving Jennifer.
DAVID approaches the opposite side of the bed and gets ready to pounce ... CUT
TO: a close-up of the monitor. The he-man chases the pulse light ...

DAVID dives across the bed just as he man swipes the pulse light with his
sword. DAVID has landed on top of JENNIFER. The pulse light explodes and the
monitor screen whites-out. JENNIFER wakes up with a start.

                                                                                   106

                                        JENNIFER
             Dad!     Get off!?   What's happening here?!   Mom?

ALISON covers her mouth, tearful, but she can't hold it back.        She laughs.

DAVID and KEVIN stare at JENNIFER. They can't help but join in the laughter.
JENNIFER has no idea what's going on. BEAN is happy that everyone is happy.

                                     KEVIN
             I don't care what anyone says. Mr. Bean brought my sister back
             from the dead. He did it under laboratory conditions. My eyes do
             not lie!

ALISON grins at him.      Then at BEAN.

                                                        MIX THROUGH TO:

INT.   LEARY HOUSE.     KITCHEN.   NIGHT.

ALISON is fixing some coffee.       DAVID enters.

                                            DAVID
             Here, let me do that.

                                          ALISON
             No, I'm fine.

He just stands there.

             okay - you grind the beans, and


He moves towards her - his arms slip round her waist.

             ... put them in the .... ( but she can't concentrate I don't
             believe this. I'm being seduced by my own husband.

Pause. They are just about to kiss when BEAN enters.
He's a bit impatient.

                                      BEAN
             Ahm - excuse me ... ( POINTING TO HIS WATCH ) You know..

They jump apart.      The moment is gone.

                                          ALISON
             Oh yes.     Sorry.    Though I think these are ready.

                                                                                  107


ALISON takes out two single socks which have been neatly wrapped around a
couple of drinks mats and put in the toaster slots.

                                        ALISON
             There.     Is that how you like them?

BEAN beams at her.      He's impressed - and feels he's accepted.    He leaves.

                                          ALISON
             He's not too bad.       I can live with him.

                                     DAVID
             I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.       I have a tale
             to tell. And not a happy one.

                                                                            CUT TO:

EXT.   THE LEARY'S KITCHEN.     NIGHT

Looking in front outside, we see Alison sit down. We see, ,but do not hear
David start to talk. Within seconds her hands go up to her face in horror.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.     DAY.

With heavy hearts everyone is gathered to hear their fate. Pan across the
familiar faces. DAVID. BERNIE. ELMER. ANNIE. BEAN, looking nervous and
shifty. Dead silence as GRIERSON stands, very solemnly.

                                    GRIERSON
             Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday
             teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would
             have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent
             philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself
             for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had
             realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell
             her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership
             flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice-
             President.


CUT TO BERNIE, looking smug next to DAVID, who is pretty shocked by this.

                                                                                108

                                    GRIERSON
               He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and
               the 21st century.

                                          BERNIE
               Thank you, sir.       Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we
               can ...

                                    GRIERSON
               Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive
               interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask,
               survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?
               Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we
               find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a
               criminal of great genius.

BEAN looks pleased - but then realises it's not a suitable emotion ~ so nods
sagely.

               Insurance? Not a chance. Those bastards never pay. So,
               surely we're bankrupt? Surely your jobs are forfeit? Surely
               you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as
               waiters and boys? Yes. Yes indeed. Except for one little
               thing. one little thing done by one little man. Dare I say,
               one helluva little man. Watch this.

Everyone is totally at a     loss. GRIERSON stands and moves to the framed poster
of Whistler's Mother on     the wall. He then produces a plastic key card and
inserts it in a slot on     the side of the frame. A buzz and a click! An
electric motor starts to     whirrrr ...

The glass, along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster, slides
gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the
original oil of Whistler's Mother.

                                    GRIERSON
               Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler's Mother!

There are gasps from the room.     BEAN is open mouthed.

GRIERSON beams as many applaud and BEAN now joins in hyperactively.      He's
saved!

                              GRIERSON
                The best security in the world is no match for a master
                criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank
                you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new
                Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the
                computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were
                so rudely interrupted by events.

The room is emptying.     DAVID and BEAN stand there, DAVID stunned.   GRIERSON
heads over.

                                    GRIERSON
             David, David, David ...

                                       DAVID
             I'm fired?    Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?

                                    GRIERSON
               Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct,
               relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred,
               through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I
               trust Bernie will be able to reverse.

                                       David
              But ....

                                    GRIERSON
               I will of course invite you an excellent reference - or Bernie
               will.

BERNIE looks across from the computer and smiles.      BEAN has his eyes on DAVID.
He is mortified by what's

happening.   GRIERSON notices but misinterprets his worried expression.


                                    GRIERSON
               Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation
               for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite
               bathroom.

DAVID glares at BERNIE.     BEAN is thinking 'No!   I don't want to stay with
horrible BERNIE.'

                                    GRIERSON
             How are you making out there?

                                                                                110

                                      BERNIE
             All fixed up, sir.   Stick around, Davey boy.   This is going to be
             quite a show.

He presses an intercom.    He's enjoying himself.

             Hi everyone - this is your new Vice President, Bernie Shistler.
             Would you please watch your video screens. You're in for a treat,
             guys.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   VARIOUS ROOMS.   DAY.

All the staff in all the rooms, gallery, canteen, corridors, look up at
various screens. Cut round rooms during this flashy demonstration.

                                     BERNIE
                                      (V/0)
             Here you can see our new interactive gallery guide.    Every picture
             in the gallery will have its own story to tell.

A Van Gogh picture comes up on the giant video screens

....and then keeps changing, as BERNIE keeps talking.

             Just click , and here is a portrait of the painter - then his
             family then other paintings by him - then other pictures relevant
             to him in the gallery

 Everyone is delighted and impressed.

             And the beauty is, any idiot can use it. Dr Bean - would you like
             a try?

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE - DAY.

BEAN swiftly obliges and sits at the computer.

                                     BERNIE
             Perhaps you'd like to bring up Whistler's Mother.

 But BEAN has another plan.    He begins to click boxes.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   MAIN GALLERY - DAY.

The Millais painting we have seen before, with the padlock, comes up on the
video screen.

                                    BERNIE
                                     (V/0)
                 Ah, Our visiting professor has chosen the splendid Millais
                 painting - "His Mistress"

                                                                       CUT BACK:

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.     DAY.

BEAN busy on the computer.

                                     BERNIE
               Just click on the corner.

BEAN again disobeys ... He clicks on the padlock repeatedly - humming the
familiar 'Goblins' tune. BERNIE is looking very tense.

                                     BERNIE
               Right let me take over now...

BEAN turns and snarls at him - almost a bark ...

                                                                             CUT TO:
INT.   THE MAIN GALLERY - DAY

Everyone is glued to the screens.

                                     BERNIE
              You've had long enough on it now.       A joke's a joke.   That's it.
              Period!

On the computer screens, the screen has gone black, just as it did when Bean
was playing earlier, and the 6 dashes have appeared with the flashing cursor
over the first of them. All watch, intrigued by what they see.

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE DAY

The blood drains from BERNIE's face.        Still humming happily, BEAN slowly types
in the letters:

                                     P-E-R-I-0-D

                                     BERNIE
             You can stop right there, Mr! Those are confidential ...

                                                                                 112


Words and figures fill the screen.        BEAN throws his hands up and sings a
verbal fanfare:

                                          BEAN
             Daaa!   Daaa!

GRIERSON moves to DAVID's side and the two stare at the screen, the meaning of
its contents dawning on them. Close up of the screen as their eyes find the
words: `NEW ARTIST EXHIBIT' in the middle of columns of words, figures and
dollar signs.

                                                                             CUT TO:
INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.     ALL ROOMS.

The same figures are being flashed all over on the huge screens. People
watching and listening in awe. ANNIE and ELMER stare at it angrily.

                                                                           CUT TO:
INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE ~ DAY

                                     BERNIE
             Excuse me, If I may just ...

                                    GRIERSON
                                    (calmly)
             Shut up, Schimmel. Exactly how long have you been siphoning
             gallery money into your own private accounts?

DAVID scrolls down the screen.

                                     DAVID
             Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all
             completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...

                                     BERNIE
             I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...

                                     GRIERSON
             Horse shit.   You're dead, grease-ball.   Period.

He pushes a button, that sends a picture of what's happening in his office
throughout the Gallery.

             My friends, good news. Mr Schimmel is not only no longer Vice-
             President. He actually no longer works here.

                                     BERNIE
              But wait a minute - you can't let some moron from England turn
              you against me. I deny any knowledge of this. He probably
              typed in all this stuff himself. Don't you find it all a bit
              suspicious that it's here at his fingertips. (pointing at Bean)
              There's your criminal, gentlemen. There's the Limey that set me
              up!

Pause. All eyes turn to BEAN.     CUT TO people watching the big screens
everywhere.

                                      GRIERSON
              Dr. Bean.    Have you got anything to say to that?

 BEAN looks long and hard at BERNIE.

                                      BEAN
              Yes- (PAUSE) It's exceedingly rude to point.

And punches BERNIE sharply in the nose.    Everyone in the gallery bursts into
applause.

                                                                           CUT TO:

EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY.

Half an hour later. Police cars draw up.      BERNIE is shoved in the back seat
of one. GRIERSON, BEAN & DAVID watch.

                                    GRIERSON
                               (to uniformed cop)
              I don't know what your methods are these days, Officer, but I'd

             also ask him a few questions about the destruction of the
             Whistler copy.

BEAN nods his head firmly.    The car pulls away.     Then breaks and reverses.
The SIDE-KICK gets out.

                                     SIDE~KICK
            Oh, yeah - I forgot.

SIDE-KICK opens the back of the car.    He takes out a huge bunch of flowers.

             The chief said I was to give you these.

BEAN is delighted. Then sniffs the flowers.      What a nasty stink.    Not his
sort of thing at all.

                                                                                  114


SIDE-KICK drives AWAY.   GRIERSON turns to DAVID.

                                   GRIERSON
            I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise
            me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that
            you do not.

                                    DAVID
            VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...

He looks sideways to Bean, who is frantically pointing to his spine.       DAVID
gets the message, and changes his tune..

            Let me think about that, Thomas.     We'd have to talk quite a salary
            hike.

                                     GRIERSON
            Of course.

                                       DAVID
            And a car.

                                     GRIERSON
            Mmmmm...


                                       DAVID
            Maybe two cars.

                                     GRIERSON
            A car sounds sensible.

                                    DAVID
            And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.
            Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of
            time to make up.

DAVID heads off. BEAN wants to follow, but needs to get rid of the stinky
flowers. He turns to ANNIE and gives them to her to be rid of them. She
beams with delight: after all, he DID love her.

BEAN heads off with DAVID to the parking lot.       As they go, DAVID puts an arm

round BEAN.

Who shoos him away instantly.           No sloppiness for him.

                                                                                CUT TO:

EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.          HALL - DAY.

The LEARY family in a group.           JENNIFER's arm in a sling.

                                       ALISON
                well, it's been... unusual. But thank you.

She goes to kiss BEAN - but he just sticks out his hand, and shakes it firmly.
Then moves on to JENNIFER.

                                            JENNIFER
                Good-bye Mr Bean.        Sorry I screamed that first time.

 He shakes her broken arm firmly ... and she screams again.

                                             DAVID
                Come on          hurry or we'll be late.

                                                                                CUT TO:

EXT.   LEARY HOUSE.       DAY.

BEAN, KEVIN    & DAVID    get into the car. It pulls away, as they drive off, BEAN
sticks his    hand of    the window - and waves a last farewell to ALISON and
JENNIFER.     At last    a sentimental moment - romantic music swelling - like Liza
Minelli at    the end    of "Cabaret".

Until the waving hand viciously cracks against the wooden front gate as the
car squeezes past.

                                                           MIX THROUGH TO:

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.          DEPARTURE AREA - DAY

The three 30 year old women, dressed in curly red wigs from the musical,
'Annie', hug and kiss their little BALD MAN and send him off through the
gates. They shriek and wave him good-bye. DAVID, KEVIN and BEAN are there.

                                       DAVID
               ... Oh, and Grierson phoned Lord Walton at the National. Said
               good things about you. So expect a great reception back home,
               huh?

BEAN delighted. Promotion is in his sights. He studies his watch.              He's
being polite but held really like to get going.

                                                                                      116

                                       KEVIN
               Good-bye Beanie. It's Bean .... surreal.          And don't forget you're
               welcome to come back anytime ...

   DAVID delivers a sharp nudge to his ribs.

                                      KEVIN
              ... in the distant future.

                                      DAVID
              Bye, Bean. Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?      I know
              it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.

BEAN    nods abruptly, picks up his case, checks his watch and goes. He doesn't
look    back. Kevin and David turn and walk away. DAVID does stop to look back
over    his shoulder at BEAN, heading off in the distance. But BEAN doesn't
turn,    so DAVID walks on.

Then there is suddenly a tap on his shoulder. It's BEAN, ,as though he's
magically jumped there. He gives DAVID a big bear hug, a big grin, and then a
little wave - and heads away. In the distance, he treads on the back of ,some
one's shoe.

                                                       MIX THROUGH TO:

EXT.    THE NATIONAL GALLERY.   LONDON - DAY

Shot from high up. BEAN's lime green mini approaches, coming around Trafalgar
Square, and drives up onto the pavement, in front of the gallery. It stops
and BEAN gets out. He looks up at the building, pleased to be back.

                                                                           CUT TO:

EXT.    THE NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

BEAN pauses outside the revolving doors to clip his staff identity badge onto
his top pocket. He enters in high spirits.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.    THE NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

BEAN enters the reception hall. It is totally deserted.
He frowns, and heads on, puzzled..

                                                                                  117

INT.    NATIONAL GALLERY.   GALLERY 1    DAY

The place    is totally empty except for a CLEANER sweeping up litter in the
middle of    the room. There are faded rectangles on the walls where all the
paintings    should be. Only one very solid looking statue remains. BEAN is
thoroughly    perplexed

                                        CLEANER
              They've moved, guy.


BEAN is utterly perplexed. He looks round the corner into another empty
gallery, and shakes his head.

                                                                           CUT TO:

EXT.   THE NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

BEAN looks up at the building and gives a disgusted grunt ,before getting into
his car and drives off around Trafalgar Square. His brow is deeply furrowed.
What will he do now with his life?

                                                                         CUT TO:
INT.   THE NATIONAL GALLERY ~ DAY

The empty gallery BEAN just inspected. Then, from out behind the one
remaining statue, emerges MISS HUTCHINSON. Then, from behind a pillar, LORD
WALTON.

                          LORD WALTON
               Is he gone?

                          MISS HUTCHINSON
               Yes, my lord.

                           LORD WALTON
               Tell the others.

                           MISS HUTCHINSON
               Very well, my lord.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   PITCH DARK ROOM.       DAY.

Pitch dark. A door opens and the light from the corridor falls on the 150
gallery employees squashed into this one tiny room. It's the gent's loo.

                                                                              118

MISS HUTCHINSON's head pops in.

                                  MISS HUTCHINSON
                   He's gone.

Massive cheer, bowlers in the air, massive music.     Roll credits.

                                                                         CUT TO:

EXT.   BEAN'S HOUSE        DAY.

Behind the credits, we see close-ups of BEAN hammering away at large planks of
wood on some wooden structure.

He walks    away from it - without us seeing what it is
and goes    to his Mini, where TEDDY sits on a pile of books in the front seat,
wearing a    seat belt. Bean gets into the car, which is laden with suitcases,
starts it    up and drives ....

.... straight into the huge crate he has built.     A rope tied to the back
bumper pulls the lid closed behind him.

                                                                         CUT TO:

EXT.   MOTORWAY.    DAY.

The crate sits on the back of a speeding truck.
                                                                       CUT TO:

EXT.   AIRPORT.   DAY.

The crate is now on the top of a forklift truck moving up the ramp on an
American airline cargo plane. Close up on a large sticker on the crate: it
reads: "DAVID LEARY, 23 WOODFORD AVENUE, CHESTERFIELD, CALIFORNIA. HANDLE
WITH CARE.


And cut to the plane flying through clear skies.   Though, for the Lear's of
course there are no clear skies ahead.


THE END

Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country
    road. A car chugs over the horizon.

                        NARRATOR
              As far as con man stories go,
              I think I've heard them all.
              Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers,
              tales drawn long and tall.
              But if one bears a bookmark in
              the confidence man's tome,
              twould be that of Penelope,
              and of the brothers Bloom.


2   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING                                  2

    The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a
    country house.

    Both in black.   Each with a suitcase.

                        NARRATOR
              At ten and thirteen Bloom and
              Stephen (the younger and the old)


3   INT. KITCHEN (FLASHBACK)                                      3

    The two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating
    breakfast.

                        NARRATOR
              had been through several foster
              families.

    The FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen
    LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the
    crap out of him.

                        NARRATOR (cont'd)
              Thirty eight, all told.


4   INT. CHILD WELFARE OFFICE - DAY                               4

    CLOSE ON - A CHILD WELFARE FILE COVER

    "Bloom" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip
    by. Under the "REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS" field we catch
    different entries: "BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE", "UNMANAGEABLE",
    "MOLESTED CAT", "SOLD OUR FURNITURE", "CAUSED FLOODING".



                                                               2

                           NARRATOR
                 Mischief moved them on in life, and
                 moving kept them close.


5   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE PORCH                                     5

    The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand.

                           NARRATOR
                 For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen
                 Bloom, and both had more than most.

    The front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the
    brothers suspiciously.


6   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - LATER THAT DAY                      6

    A wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey.

                           NARRATOR
                 Another home, another main street.
                 Stephen looked around,
                 then summed the burgh up thusly:

                           STEPHEN
                 Bloom, we've hit a one hat town.

                           NARRATOR
                 One theater. One car wash. One
                 cafe. One park. One cat. Which,
                 through some mishap, had one leg.

    The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street
    with its one leg.

                           STEPHEN
                 Sweet Jesus. Look at that.


7   EXT. SCHOOL - DAY                                            7

    A group of children flee the school joyfully.

                           NARRATOR
                 One school, which meant one tight-
                 knit group of local well-off kids.

                                                                 3
  




8    EXT. CANDY SHOP                                                 8

     The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket
     Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 Their pocket-change bought rocket
                 pops,


9    INT. CANDY SHOP                                                 9

     The brothers at the counter. Bloom watches the children go,
     while Stephen counts out pennies.

                           NARRATOR
                 The brothers,

     Stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a
     scowl.

                           STEPHEN
                 Pixie Stix.


10   EXT. PARK                                                   10

     The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 They were the `they'. All well
                 loved, rooted, happy as you please.

     Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too
     happy nursing their Pixie Stix.

                           NARRATOR (cont'd)
                 Always there. In every town.

     Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette.

                           STEPHEN
                 The playground bourgeoisies.

     He storms off.    Bloom lingers, staring silently at the
     children.

                                                                  4
   




11   EXT. FOREST                                                  11

     The brothers amble down a wooded path.     Bloom stops, staring
     into the trees.

     Through the dense thicket of foliage... the children playing.
     And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open
     patch in the leaves.

     Bloom pushes the leaves aside. A girl. Golden curls.
     Summer dress. Standing in the distance on a wide lawn.

     Bloom gazes.    Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back.


12   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS                                       12

     Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he's been
     shoved) and regains his footing and freezes, not shielded at
     all now from the playing kids and the girl.

                         NARRATOR
               Could he simply

                         STEPHEN (O.S.)
               Talk to her!

                         NARRATOR
               Just drop his fears and go? Leave
               his brother in the woods, and join
               the children?

     The girl makes eye contact, twisting a daisy chain between
     her tiny fingers. Bloom's adam apple convulses.

     He turns tail and runs back into the woods.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
               No.


13   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         13

     Brothers in bed. Bloom gazes window-ward. Stephen gazes Bloom-
     wise, shuffling a pack of cards.

                         BLOOM
               What's doing?

                            STEPHEN
               What?



                                                                   5
    
13   CONTINUED:                                                    13


                            BLOOM
                  You shuffle when you're thinking
                  something through. So whatcha
                  thinking?

                            STEPHEN
                  Not a thing.

                            NARRATOR
                  This wasn't really true.
                  Cause in the root of Stephen's
                  psyche, something now began.
                  A seed of grand epiphany. A hook.
                  A tale.


14   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                                14

                            STEPHEN
                  A plan.

     Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump, and
     talks Bloom through it.

                            NARRATOR
                  A fiction made for profit, in which
                  both boys played a part.
                  A simple con in fifteen steps.

                            STEPHEN
                  And this is where we start.

     Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes,
     each neatly numbered, stopping at #1.... "Bloom Talks To
     Girl"


15   EXT. PARK - DAY                                                 15

     Children and the gold haired Girl playing.      The wall of
     foliage where the forest begins shimmers.

                            NARRATOR
                  And then, as if a curtain had been
                  pulled back from the sky...
                  Some barrier within the younger
                  Bloom was broken.

     Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide
     lawn, confident, glowing, stopping face to golden face with
     the girl.


   

                                                                  6

                            BLOOM
                  Hi.

     They talk.    They run.   They laugh.   They play.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Bloom performed his role in
                  Stephen's story to a T.

     BOX #2 on the flowchart - "Bloom wins the kids' trust"


16   EXT. TOWN SQUARE                                             16

     Bloom does indeed, sitting and laughing with a circle of
     kids, suddenly a natural born charmer.

                            NARRATOR
                  And being who he wasn't, could be
                  as he wished to be.

     The Golden Girl smiles at him.

     From the shadows of an adjacent alley, Stephen watches,
     pleased. He slinks away.

     BOX #3 - "Stephen finds a cave" dissolves to Stephen scouting
     out a cave deep in the woods.


18   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              18

     In the park, Bloom runs with the kids, laughing.

     BOX #5 - "Stephen buys supplies" dissolves to: Stephen in a

     several large coolers are purchased.

     Back in the park, Bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks
     homeward in the warm twilight.

                                                               7

     BOX #8 - "Stephen scouts church" dissolves to: Stephen's
     eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church. He manages to
     look devious as he snags a SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHEDULE.


22   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         22

     Bloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom. He
     glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to:

     Box #10 - "Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the
     coolers"

     Stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler.

                         STEPHEN
               Oh - kay. How's it going on the
               playground front?

                         BLOOM
               It's great.

                         STEPHEN
               So, on to step eleven, then.   The
               Tale. You tell them -

                            BLOOM
               Wait...

     Bloom's lip quivers, obviously conflicted.

                         NARRATOR
               Must the numbers rattle on?    Must
               the fiction end?

                         BLOOM
               I think I need more time to win
               their-

                          STEPHEN
               Bloom. They're not your friends.
               They're part of this, and this aint
               real. Remember, it's a con.
               And when it's done, we've just got
               us. And we'll be moving on.
                   (beat)
               So, the tale. You tell them
               there's a

23   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           23

     Bloom holds court with the kids.

                            BLOOM
                  hermit in the woods. A one eyed,
                  steel toothed vagabond...


24   INT. ATTIC                                                24

     Back to Bloom and Stephen in the attic

                            BLOOM
                  ...with blood red eyes?

                             STEPHEN
                      (nods)
                  That's good. He stopped you coming
                  home from school...


25   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           25

                            BLOOM
                  ...and told me of a cave.

                            GIRL
                  What kind of cave?

                            BLOOM
                  A cave of wonders.

                              BOY
                  Pffft ha.

                            GIRL
                  Shut up, Dave.

                            BLOOM
                  At noon on every Sunday, there
                  appears a ball of light, which
                  flutters like a butterfly...

                            GIRL
                  A will-o-whisp?

                            BLOOM
                  That's right. It guides you

                                                               9

                            STEPHEN
                  ...if you can keep up...


27   EXT. PARK                                                 27

                            BLOOM
                  ...to where the treasures lay.

                            BOY
                  So where's this cave?

                            GIRL
                  Yeah, where?


28   INT. ATTIC                                                28

                            STEPHEN
                  Ah-hah. The hermit didn't say.
                  He got this greedy glinting look,
                  the filthy red-eyed leech... and
                  said he'd tell for thirty bucks.

     Something in Bloom's face falls.


29   EXT. PARK                                                 29

     The girl's bright, trusting face looking at him. A moment of
     silence. Then, triumphant, an excited boy leaps to his feet.

                            EXCITED BOY
                  Well that's just two bucks each!

     The kids all rejoice, and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at
     Bloom. He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the
     girl's joyful gaze.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Sunday came...


30   EXT. WOODS                                                30

     Children in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark
     woods, led by Bloom.





                                                                10

                            NARRATOR
                  ...and straight from church, into
                  the woods Bloom led.


31   INT. CAVE                                                    31

     In the dim light of a cave, Stephen overturns the coolers of
     water and retreats into shadow. A flood soaks into the dirt
     floor, as outside the mouth of the cave the group of panting
     children come into sight.

                            NARRATOR
                  They stopped. Their hearts leapt.
                  There it was.


32   EXT. CAVE                                                    32

     The children look at the craggy mouth of a forboding cave.

                            GIRL
                  Just like the hermit said!

     Deep in the cave's dark maw, a spark of light.

     The children gasp collectively.    The Girl grabs Bloom's arm.

     Bloom stares, transfixed as any of them.

     The spark becomes a glowing, fluttering point of light, which
     hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then
     recedes deeper into the gloom.

     With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave.


33   INT. CAVE                                                    33

     The light glows just around the next corner... the children
     run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the
     corner...

     And the light glows just around the next corner. They
     scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light,
     but they're all having the time of their lives.

     Bloom included.    Holding the girl's hand, laughing, eyes full
     of wonder.






                                                                11

                            NARRATOR
                  For just one moment, Bloom forgot
                  himself and ran too fast.

     He puts on a burst of speed, gets ahead of the crowd.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  He'd catch the light and find the
                  treasure...

     Turning a corner, he (alone) sees the rather tawdry image of
     Stephen, flashlight in hand, shooing him back as he turns the
     next corner.

     Bloom stops running.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  But the moment passed.

     The other kids and the girl pass him, but Bloom stands dead
     still, a strange expression on his face.

     The girl turns back towards him, still running, and holds out
     her hand for him to follow.

     But he doesn't.    He stays behind, and is soon left alone.


34   EXT. PLAYGROUND                                               34

                            NARRATOR
                  They didn't catch the will-o-wisp,
                  but didn't really care.

     The muddied children walk home, laughing, while Bloom leans
     against a lamppost. Stephen appears behind him, counting
     their money.

                            STEPHEN
                  It seems to me that in the end, the
                  perfect con is where
                  each one involved gets just the
                  thing they wanted.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah I guess so.

                             NARRATOR
                  Our fledgling thieves were
                  satisfied.

                                                                12
  




35   EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - DAY                                      35

     A front door opens, revealing a porch-full of 30 angry
     parents holding 15 muddied kids by their ears.

                          NARRATOR
                The children's parents, less so.

     The Foster Parents exchange a glance.

     QUICK SHOTS -

     Stephen is smacked.

     The wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an
     angry big one.

     A telephone slams down.

     On a form, the field "Reason for return:" is filled with
     "Larceny."


36   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                           36

     Two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away.
     The bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon
     sunlight.

                          NARRATOR
                A bitter ending? Maybe. But
                there's sweetness in the mix.

     Beneath the bed, forgotten, a piece of paper.    On it, the con
     flow-chart. Numbered boxes.

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                The brothers Bloom had found their
                calling.

     One of the boxes... number six...

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                As shown in number six.

     BOX #6:   "Cut % O'Henry's"

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                `Cut' meant to negotiate, `percent'
                percentage deal.

                                                              13





37   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - DAY                                 37

     Through a storefront window - rows of the children's muddy
     Sunday clothes hang, each tagged.

                         NARRATOR
               `O'Henry's' was the town's one dry
               clean shop.

     And striding out of the store beneath the `O'Henry's
     Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a
     Rocket Pop. The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a
     little nervous. Stephen throws him back a salute.


38   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                        38

     Bloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him. Boxes of
     Rocket Pops, and one in each fist. Stephen plops down beside
     him.

                         STEPHEN
               So how's it feel?

     Bloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in
     the distance.

                         NARRATOR
               In truth, young Bloom won't know
               for twenty years just how he felt.

     HONK! A `Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street.    The
     brothers pick themselves up.

                         NARRATOR (cont'd)
               And so, we'll skip ahead now in our
               story.

     Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop.

                         STEPHEN
               Let `em melt.

     The con man team of the brothers Bloom, suitcases in hand,
     strides down the alleyway.

     Stephen in front.






                                                               14

     Bloom a few steps behind, stealing one last glance back at
     the children playing in the sun.

                                                        CUT TO:

40   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT                                         40

     Flames spread over a wall of bookshelves.

     TITLE CARD:    BERLIN, 25 YEARS LATER

     A YOUNG MAN in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of
     the flaming books.

                            YOUNG MAN
                  He gets the scarab, you get the
                  money, I get the girl... so in the
                  end, everyone gets everything he
                  wants.

     Three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the
     young man folds to the ground.

     A sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun, while
     behind him the rest of the library roars in flames.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god
                  are you... oh god he's dead,
                  Victor's dead... you've killed us!
                  We had it he was right it was all
                  in the bag and now we're dead, why?
                  Why, you stupid son of a bitch?

     The owner of the voice, a MAN a bit younger than Charleston
     in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston
     hard.






                                                               15

                             CHARLESTON
                  Cause the Turk was right. After
                  seeing her, after that night on the
                  airstrip, after Cairo everything
                  changed, and he couldn't see the
                  play through that one milky eye,
                  but the Turk was right about one
                  thing, that there's nothing
                  beautiful about money. She's
                  beautiful.

                            MCGUIRE
                  This isn't happening...

                            CHARLESTON
                  He'll never have her now. She's
                  free. And I'll never see her in
                  scarlet again, her chestnut hair,
                  but it's worth the money and my job
                  and his life and the rest of my
                  life that she's free.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Charleston. I can't be here...

                            CHARLESTON
                  You're not here. Neither of us
                  are. It's Mowcher's gun.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Mowcher is at the bottom of the
                  Spree with a cowl in his neck!

     Charleston gets to his feet.

                            CHARLESTON
                  They won't find him for a week, and
                  the Albino will chalk it up to
                  Davey, he won't talk. We're clean.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Listen to you - four months ago you
                  were an investment banker! Now
                  you're nothing. The Scarab's lost.
                  The money's gone. It'll rot in the
                  Peruvian earth. It's gone.

     Charleston limps to the flaming doorway.






                                                              16

40   CONTINUED: (2)                                            40


                         CHARLESTON
               The man named Charleston you met
               nine months and a thousand years
               ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is
               dead. If we see each other again
               it'll be as strangers. As for the
               money... let it rot.

     He exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of
     Victor. A long beat. The distant roar of an engine, tires
     squealing.

     Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN,
     early 20s. She gives a nearly imperceptible nod.

                         MCGUIRE
               Wow.

     He pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood. McGuire looks
     to Victor and the woman for a reaction. Gets none.

                         MCGUIRE (cont'd)
               Wow is the word you're both looking
               for. Wow.

     The Asian woman nods slightly.

                         VICTOR
                   (un-wowishly)
               You're a genius, Stephen.

     For McGuire is, of course, Stephen.

                         STEPHEN
               We're a genius, Bloom.

     Just as Victor is, indeed, Bloom.   He spits.

                         BLOOM
               Tastes like tin foil.

                         STEPHEN
               So does real blood. Buy you a
               drink.

     Stephen escorts the Asian woman out, while Bloom wipes his
     lip.

                                                              17





41   EXT. HOUSE - PRE-DAWN                                       41

     A stately house in the middle of nowhere, on fire. Stephen
     holds the door of a car open, while Bloom steps from the
     flaming house.

                         STEPHEN
               "Four months and a thousand years
               ago." That's Kipling, isn't it?
               He stole that from Kipling.

                           BLOOM
               No.


42   EXT. BERLIN - PRE-DAWN                                      42

     Hazy light over the sprawling city.


43   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                            43

     A low, cozy basement level bar. A dozen people crowd it, all
     expectant in a surprise-party type way.

     A TURKISH GENTLEMAN in a white linen suit and eye patch
     raises his drink when Bloom, Stephen and the woman enter.

                         THE TURK
               Make way, make room for the
               brothers Bloom!

     The bar bursts into cheers.


44   INT. DEUTCH MARK - LATER                                    44

     A DWARF dances on the bar. Stephen plays cards with the
     Turk, an ALBINO and a small crowd of character types.

                         THE TURK
               Nine months, six countries, three
               faked deaths, for one mark. You're
               a beautiful antique, my friend.

     They clink glasses.

                           ALL
               Proust.





                                                                    18

                            THE TURK
                  One thing baffles me. The entire
                  con would have fallen apart if
                  Charleston had walked away. How did
                  you know he'd pull the trigger?

     Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards.

                            STEPHEN
                  Just think of any card.    Got one?

     Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades.

                               THE TURK
                  No.

     Stephen shrugs.

                            STEPHEN
                  But if I do it enough, eventually
                  it'll work on someone. And then
                  it'll be the best card trick in the
                  world.

     Wink. The dwarf slips, plummets from the bar. Stephen kicks
     a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch.

                               STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Ante up.

                            THE TURK
                  It's true you never work with the
                  same crew twice?

                            STEPHEN
                  That's true.

                               THE TURK
                  Well shit.     Except for the uh, for
                  her?

                            STEPHEN
                  La Chinoise?

                               THE TURK
                  Yeah.

     Back at the bar - the Asian woman.       The CHINK.   Being hit on
     by a weasly ROMANIAN.

                            ROMANIAN
                  Yeah, I'm pretty big into anime.

  

                                                               19

     She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes.

                         STEPHEN
               Our fifth Beatle. She knows the
               ins and the outs, and so far as I
               can tell, speaks three words of
               English.

     She taps on the bar.

                            THE CHINK
               Jameson.

                            BARTENDER
               Ice?

     She says `no' with a look.

                         THE ALBINO
               So she's with you and Bloom till
               the end.

                         STEPHEN
               Just till the wind changes.

     Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink.

     She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the
     bullet bouncing off her.

                         THE TURK
               Where is Bloom?

     In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn
     velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck
     with a queen of hearts he can't play.

     A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face
     through the curtains.

                         ROSE
               There you are. Hiding?

                            BLOOM
               Yeah.

                         ROSE
               I've been learning.      Stephen likes
               to talk about you.

                         BLOOM
               Did he tell you the cave story?



                                                              20

                         ROSE
               Is it true?

                         BLOOM
               What else did he tell you?

                         ROSE
               I'm not going to tell it as good as
               Stephen. You two kicked around
               till your early teens, then stowed
               away on a merchant marine freighter
               and ended up in St. Petersburg,
               where you spent five years under
               the tutelage of a shadowy old
               swindler named the Diamond Dog.
               And he was your Fagin and Stephen
               was his Artful Dodger, but it ended
               suddenly and badly.

                         BLOOM
               Stephen took his eye out with an
               antique rapier.

                         ROSE
               Why did he do that?

                         BLOOM
               And then the Brothers Bloom lit out
               on their own to make their fortune
               as gentleman thieves. Sounds
               romantic.

                          ROSE
               It does.

     She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the
     table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a
     kiss.

     Bloom's eyes stay open.

                         BLOOM
               You want to know how Stephen did
               it? With Charleston?

                         ROSE
               It's not the first thing on my
               mind.

                                                              21





45   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          45

     A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf.

                         BLOOM (O.S.)
               He positioned me in the same spot
               where, seven years ago,
               Charleston's wife stood and told
               him she was leaving.

     The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years
     ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He chose my outfit to mirror her
               suit.

     Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the
     Wife's outfit.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He even phonetically matched my
               final words to hers.

                         WIFE
               This is the end. Charelston, you've
               always been a dunce.

     Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room.

                         BLOOM (IN FLASHBACK)
               So in the end, everyone gets
               everything he wants.

     BANG.


46   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                          46

                         BLOOM
               That's what he does, he writes his
               cons the way dead Russians write
               novels, with thematic arcs and
               imbedded symbolism and shit. And
               he wrote me as a vulnerable anti-
               hero. And that's why you think you
               want to kiss me. It's a con.

     He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar
     towards the exit, passing Stephen.




                                                                   22

                  I need air.

                            STEPHEN
                  Who doesn't?
                      (plays a card)
                  That's the big 2.


47   EXT. BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING                               47

     Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.      A THOUSAND
     YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square.

     Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt
     bright red with fake blood, face long as hell.

     Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully
     across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with
     him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
     face.

     He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off
     his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his
     hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
     smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom.

     As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile.

     Stephen paces out into the street.

                            STEPHEN
                  We missed the sunrise.    That
                  would've been nice.

     They walk across the street to the Tiergarten.


48   EXT. TIERGARTEN - EARLY MORNING                                  48

     Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers
     stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom
     trailing behind, lost in thought.

     Camel heads poke over a wall with `Kamelhaus' painted on it.
     Stephen throws open the wall's gate.

                            STEPHEN
                      (to camels)
                  Back to the swamps!

     The camels are unimpressed.       Bloom slouches into a bench.

 

                                                               23

     Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom, who nods. Stephen
     cuts the deck, shows him a card. Bloom shakes his head, no.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  At least you're honest.

     Bloom stares into space.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Alright, let's do this. Let's just
                  get it done. So first you say `I'm
                  quitting, Stephen. I'm out.' Then
                  I say...

                            BLOOM
                  `Do we have to go through this
                  again.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Then you make a show of putting on
                  your jacket and say `no I mean it
                  this time Stephen, this time I'm
                  really out.'

                            BLOOM
                  Then you say `let's have a drink,
                  and in the morning Bloom you'll
                  have come to your senses'

     Stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it.

                            STEPHEN
                      (re: Bloom's bright red
                       blood stain)
                  That's a major design flaw in fake
                  blood, by the way.

                            BLOOM
                  `and we'll be moving on.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Real blood turns brown after a half
                  hour.

                            BLOOM
                  Listen to me, Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  This scotch costs more than your
                  suit.

               Listen to me.

                         STEPHEN
               And the flask stopped a bullet from
               a black powder rifle at Appomattox.

                         BLOOM
               Listen.

     Bloom bats the flask away. A camel catches it, tips its
     camel neck back and gulps it down.

                         STEPHEN
               That's my new favorite camel.

                         BLOOM
               I hate you. I hate this life, I
               hate it, I hate that you won't
               fucking listen to me for one
               goddamn second. Just listen.

     Stephen listens.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I can't wake up next to another
               stranger, who thinks they know me,
               or even wants to know me, cause I
               don't know - who - I'm thirty five
               years old, and I, I'm useless, I'm
               crippled, I don't, I've only ever
               lived life through these roles that
               aren't me, that are written for me
               by you.

                         STEPHEN
               Tell me what you want.

                         BLOOM
               Why? So you can write me a role in
               a story where I get it? You're not
               listening to me. I want a real...
               thing, I wanna do things how I
               don't know are gonna work out, a,
               I, want, a...

     The camel belches.    Bloom makes a show of putting on his
     jacket.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I'm going away. Somewhere you or

                  more stories.

     Bloom tosses Stephen the bowler, and storms off.    He gets
     about ten feet, then hesitates.

     Then goes.

     The camel nudges Stephen's jacket, looking for more scotch.
     Stephen puts the bowler on its camel head.

                               STEPHEN
                  Sorry bud.     I'm dry.

     Stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning
     mist, lost in thought.

     His hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards.

     FADE OUT

     FADE IN:


49   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                49

     Beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of
     Ferentino.

     TITLE CARD:    Ferentino, Italy - 3 months later.

     A tiny red car inches its way across the countryside. It
     winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill.

                                                                26
  




50   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                50

     The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment.   The red
     car's bumper pulls up, parks.

     On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack
     of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips'
     owner heads for the apartment door.


51   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                51

     Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment.

     A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little
     light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the
     window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom.

     Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few
     extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip.

     A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and
     berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian.

                         STEPHEN
               She's right, you know.

                         BLOOM
               Why are you here, Stephen?

                         STEPHEN
               Put on your face, let's eat.


52   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - LATER                              52

     Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother
     follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the
     last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the
     cheek and sends them off.


53   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - DAY                                     53

     A few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside.
     The red car parked nearby. Stephen eats, Bloom stares.

                         BLOOM
               How'd you find me?





                                                                    27

                               STEPHEN
                  The Chink.

                            BLOOM
                  How'd the Chink find me?

     Stephen's eyes:       "Are you joking?"

                            STEPHEN
                  How've you been?

                               BLOOM
                  Great.

                            STEPHEN
                  I've done a lot of thinking the
                  past three months. You don't want
                  out. You think you do but you
                  don't. Here, c'mere. I want to
                  show you something.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm quits, Stephen.

     Stephen stands, strolls off.        Bloom wearily follows.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Where are we going?

                            STEPHEN
                  New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                      (sighs)
                  Well lemme get my jacket.

                                                             CUT TO:


54   EXT. AN AIRPLANE ROARS RIGHT TO LEFT                              54

                                                             CUT TO:


55   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - AFTERNOON                                55

     A long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a
     ludicrous mansion. Our trio watch it from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  Looks like an etching from a Bronte
                  novel.

  

                                                               28
 
55   CONTINUED:                                                 55


     Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The
     illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to
     a plaster deer in the front yard.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Huh. Look at that. Well thanks.
                  I'm gonna head back to Italy.

                            STEPHEN
                  Big money. Inheritance. Dad died
                  early, Mom died two years ago after
                  ten years fighting an illness that
                  I can't pronounce.

                              BLOOM
                  How much?

     The Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick. Just
     when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Jesus.

                              STEPHEN
                  Look out.

     Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red
     Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut
     and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of
     dust and smoke.

     Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the
     dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a
     non-Lamborghini way.

     Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy.


56   EXT. THICKET - LATER                                        56

     Off to the side of the house. They lean on the hood of their
     rental car, an old school Cadillac.

     In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new
     Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one.

                            BLOOM
                  What am I doing here, Stephen? I
                  have one rule, and you've never
                  even tested it.



 

                                                                   29

                            STEPHEN
                  Stick with me.

                            BLOOM
                  No women. One rule. You know we
                  don't do women, I don't, and it's
                  not a morality thing or- a thing-
                  it's, whatever it is it doesn't
                  matter what it is, that's just our
                  rule. So what are we,
                      (RE: the rental car)
                  Did you rent a `78 Caddy?

     Stephen nods to the Chink.       Bloom nods appreciatively.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Controversial choice. So no, is
                  what I'm saying. I'm quits anyway.
                  I'll be in Italy. Drinking.

     The front door of the mansion slams, and they watch Penelope
     drag a harp around into the back yard.

                            STEPHEN
                  Penelope Stamp. Thirty three.
                  Lived at home her whole life.

     Bloom's eyes never leave Penelope.

                            BLOOM
                  An eccentric shut-in rich bitch.
                  You're not helping your case.

     The Chink silently hands Bloom a retractable spyglass, he
     watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump.

                            STEPHEN
                  She's bored, a seed in the snow.
                  We're going to put her through a
                  grand adventure, bring her to life.

                            BLOOM
                  So this is the big plan. Lure me
                  back into things with some
                  beautiful intriguing elusive girl,
                  stir up old memories with the
                  prospect of redemption and rebirth.
                  Seriously Stephen. Amateur night.

     Bloom watches her play Clash songs on the harp.



   

                                                              30

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I'm not saying yes. But what's the
               con?

     Stephen spreads a folded piece of paper on a tree stump, with
     a flowchart on it. Numbered boxes.

     Bloom doesn't take his spyglass off Penelope.

                         STEPHEN
               It's actually pretty simple. We're
               brothers, antique dealers, perusing
               the Americas for antiquities en
               route to someplace exciting via
               luxury steamer, say Greece. You
               tie into her and work your magic...

     Penelope plays on.


57   INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                                    57

     Very late. Bloom and Stephen in armchairs, collars loosened,
     drinks drunk. The Chink's Chuck Taylors stick up over the
     back of a chair.

     Bloom holds the con flowchart.

                         STEPHEN
               ...and so that's how it ends, in
               Mexico, a burst of violence then a
               moment of truth on the beach. What
               do you think?

     Bloom idly looks over the chart.

                         BLOOM
               You've got something up your
               sleeve. This is about me, right?
               Somehow.

                         STEPHEN
               This might not be something you
               know, but they've all been about
               you. Maybe that's why they've none
               of them been perfect, I've never
               been able to give you what you
               really want.






                                                                31

                            BLOOM
                  I want to be outta all this. So by
                  definition, this is not going to
                  give me what I want.

     Stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                  This will be the last one.    You'll
                  let me go.

     The Chink's inert sneakers come to life and she's on her
     feet, silently going to Stephen's side.

                            STEPHEN
                  I will never approach you to do
                  another con again.
                      (to the Chink)
                  Let's make it a red Schwinn.

     Bloom stares at #1 on the flowchart - "BLOOM MEETS PENELOPE."


58   EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                      58

     A grumpy Bloom perched on the red Schwinn, an ill fitting
     Styrofoam helmet on his head.

     Stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below.

     The Chink sets up a lawn umbrella, a chair for herself, and a
     cooler with Coronas.

                            BLOOM
                  There are less painful ways to cut
                  into a mark.

                            STEPHEN
                  Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk.
                  Score to beat is 7.9. Keep your
                  head in the game, the Chinese judge
                  is tough.

                            BLOOM
                  This is a banana seat, man!

     He directs this to the Chink, who blinks with innocent
     incomprehension and opens two Coronas.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Don't give me that blank look, you
                  know what a fuckin banana seat is.

 

                                                                   32

     Stephen spots something and blows a whistle.       With a grunt,
     Bloom launches the Schwinn forward.

     Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the
     steep steep hill.

     At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway.      Cruising down
     the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini.

     Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into.

                                                            CUT TO:


59   EXT. HIGHWAY / SKY - DAY                                         59

     Silent and blue. Time slows to a crawl as Bloom sails
     through the air, arcing over the Italian luxury car's hood
     and past a horrified Penelope, face frozen mid scream behind
     the wheel.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  There's actually a knack to this.
                  You want to avoid dying or breaking
                  anything that won't grow back, but
                  you don't want to roll out of it
                  and come up roses. If you're
                  trying to fast track into a mark's
                  sympathies, there's nothing quite
                  as efficient as having your first
                  conversation be from a hospital bed
                  they put you in. I usually like to
                  try for a dislocated shoulder.

     Several things happen at once.

     Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard.      The bent bike
     follows suit.

     Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards.         8.9
     and 5.6.

     The Lamborghini screeches to a stop.

     Everything is still.

     Then the car jolts forward. Then stops. Then again, jolts
     and stops. Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then
     jolts and stops.

     Bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as
     us.

 

                                                                33

     Stephen and the Chink lower their cards, equally confused.

     One last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward,
     veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to
     a stop. The horn blares.

     Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance.

     Stephen stares blankly.    The Chink raises a new score card -
     7.8.


60   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                   60

     Penelope sleeps, bruised and battered. Bloom sits bedside
     uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling. She stirs. Bloom leans
     forward.

     Slurred with sleep and drugs, she painfully barely breathes

                            PENELOPE
                  Are you alright?


61   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                61

     Bloom consults with Stephen and the Chink, both in scrubs.

                            STEPHEN
                  The Chink had it - I'm telling him,
                  I know, thank you - in her report,
                  I missed it. This is actually kind
                  of great, I'll tell you why.

     The Chink lights a cigarette.

                            STEPHEN
                  Dostoevsky was an epileptic.

                            BLOOM
                  I know.

                            STEPHEN
                  His seizures were preceded by an
                  enlightened euphoria, a sort of
                  opening of his spiritual eye.

                  I think the fact that she saw your
                  face the instant before a seizure
                  is a pretty goddamn good foot to
                  start things out on, right?

     Bloom stares blankly.        The Chink burps into her stethoscope.


62   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                      62

     Bloom slumps in a chair, watching Penelope sleep.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  The next step is to figure out a
                  way to insinuate yourself into
                  their personal life.

     Bloom drifts off, then wakes with a start.

     It is MORNING.     Penelope is shaking him.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think they took my car.     Could
                  you drive me home?

                                BLOOM
                  Uh.   Yeah.

     She walks away, the back of her gown wide open, then turns.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm Penelope Stamp.

63   INT. CADILLAC - MORNING                                         63

     Bloom drives, Penelope gazes stiffly out the window.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Engagement. Find a connection with
                  your mark through conversation.

                  S' ok.

     Silence. He notices her playing with the side mirror knob,
     angling it to stare at him while looking out the window.

  

                                                                      35

                  This car is like riding in a huge
                  marshmallow.

     And still more silence.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Having now deftly set your hook in
                  the mark's psyche, this would be
                  the perfect time to tug the line,


64   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - MORNING                                  64

     They pull up in the car.          A tow truck is dropping off a new
     Lamborghini.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Get invited in for coffee, and tell
                  them the full tale.

     Bloom looks about to launch into something, when Penelope
     drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his
     dashboard.

                            PENELOPE
                  For the bike, and the whole, thing.
                  This was a big shit sandwich. Ok.
                  Bye.

     The car door slams and she's gone.         Bloom sits a moment.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  However, there are advantages to
                  playing it cool. Letting it lie
                  for a day or two, then casually re-
                  establish contact.

     Bloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side
     mirror so it points back to the road. As he does he sees
     Penelope in it, sprinting after his car.

     He stops.    A moment later she appears at his window, heaving.

65   INT. PENELOPE'S KITCHEN - DAY                                65

     Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen,
     neither touching their coffee. Bloom talks.

     This is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on
     Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts,
     then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again
     and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile/nod, then does it
     all again. Three or four times.

                            BLOOM
                  ...didn't really have anyone except
                  each other growing up, and our
                  father was in the antique business,
                  he had a shop in Charleston. So we
                  stuck together, my brother Stephen
                  and me, we and just took over the
                  shop when dad died. Then we
                  realized one day, we saw the
                  dealers who were finding and
                  selling us the antiques coming from
                  exotic countries all over the
                  world, and there was a, almost a
                  scent they had, when they'd come in
                  the dusty shop we worked nine to
                  five in since we were nineteen, the
                  air would, like before a rain, the
                  ions would line up, and you could
                  just smell midnight trains to Paris
                  and steamer ships and Calcutta
                  bazaars, and we made the decision,
                  we just did it, that we want to
                  have that sort of life. So we did,
                  and we've been travelling and
                  treasure hunting the world ever
                  since, and could you, I'm sorry,
                  stop doing - that, you're, I'm, ok.
                  Alright, look.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm really bad at talking to
                  people.

     Victorian, expensive. Penelope leans against the window,
     looking out. Sulking. Bloom enters.

                            BLOOM
                  So what kind of stuff do you do?

                             PENELOPE
                  Nothing.   Maybe you should go.

                            BLOOM
                  Alright. I'm just gonna finish my
                  coffee first.

     Very slowly, he sips it.     Each sip becomes a noisier and
     noisier slurp.

                            PENELOPE
                  I collect hobbies. I see someone
                  doing something I like, and I get
                  books and learn how to do it.

                             BLOOM
                  Hm.   Anything interesting?

                  Not really.

     HOBBY MONTAGE

     In which Penelope demonstrates the following with exacting
     seriousness and skill for Bloom:

     Playing the piano.      The classical guitar.   The fiddle.   The
     banjo.

     Putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle.

     Executing a perfect ollie on a skateboard.

     Juggling various items.       Riding a unicycle.   Juggling while
     riding a unicycle.

     Playing ping-pong against a wall with ungodly speed.

     Karate chopping through too much wood.

     Breakdancing.

     Playing the accordion.

     Rapping to a drum machine.

     Creating a perfect origami dragon.

     END HOBBY MONTAGE

     On Bloom's shell-shock face.

                  Is that it?

                             PENELOPE
                  No.   I know a lot of stuff.

                            BLOOM
                  You just learned this stuff, here
                  by yourself?

                  Kinda sad.

                            BLOOM
                  No. So you just thought, `so I
                  want to learn this and this,' and
                  you just did it? How do you plan
                  to use all these skills?

                            PENELOPE
                  I dunno. I'm not a planner. I
                  just do stuff. Here, look at this
                  watermelon. It's a camera. You
                  can make a pinhole camera out of
                  anything hollowish and dark.

               No, yeah it does. That's what -
               the Taj Majal taken by a fat
               tourist with diarrhea and a point-
               and-shoot camera can be the
               flattest, dullest, "here's us at
               the Taj Majal," "Oh lovely lets go
               stick our thumbs up our asses"
               picture. But you can look at the
               most menial everyday thing, and
               depending on how your pinhole
               camera eats the light, it's warped
               and peculiar and imperfect. It's
               not reproduction, it's
               storytelling.

                         BLOOM
               It's a lie that tells the truth.

                         PENELOPE
               I dunno about truth. A photograph
               is a secret about a secret. The
               more it tells you, the less you
               know.

                         BLOOM
               What's changed between now and
               twenty minutes ago? Cause this is
               kinda like a conversation.

               Huh.    Well shit.


67   EXT. BACKYARD - DAY                                       67

     Bloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house
     and ending up at the driveway.

                         BLOOM
               Well, I should, uh, it's late. So.
               I meet a lot of people in my job I
               have to professionally act
               interested in. It's a good feeling

                  Well next time I'm in town. We're
                  taking a steamer at noon tomorrow
                  off the docks, to the continent for
                  a few months.

     During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small
     of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a
     small slit of exposed skin.

     Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush
     crosses her still face.

     When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Paris and Greece, I think. I've
                  gotta get a hat. Thanks for the
                  pinhole camera demonstration. And
                  for the good conversation. Goodbye

     He drives off.    She stands in the doorway, watching him go.


68   EXT. THE DOCKS - DAY                                        68

     A jaunty steamer ship docked and ready. Bloom watches the
     access road, Stephen makes notes, the Chink whittles.

                            BLOOM
                  I need another day with her.

                  You'll have two weeks on the boat.

                  I need another day to get her on
                  the boat, she isn't hooked. That
                  bit I skipped where we were talking
                  in the backyard, it was ten minutes
                  on the optics of lensless
                  photography, we didn't really talk.

     Bloom turns from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  I think you're wrong.

     A screech of distant tires and a crash.        Bloom doesn't look.

                  Though every time I say that, you
                  end up being comically right.
                  That's her, isn't it? Yeah.

     Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have
     fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon.

     Bloom meets her.

                              PENELOPE
                  Hey.

                              BLOOM
                  Hi.    What are you doing here?

     She holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.

                            PENELOPE
                  You left this money in my kitchen.

     He doesn't take it.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah, I didn't want it, but thanks.

                              PENELOPE
                  Oh.
                      (beat)
                  Hey, where's this boat going?


69   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                   69

     The good ship Fidele breaks the waves Greece-ward.

     Bloom and Penelope stroll the deck.


  

                                                                 42

                            BLOOM
                  Why did you decide to come?

                            PENELOPE
                  Well I'd never been to Greece. Or
                  Europe. Or outside New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                  It just seems like a big leap.
                  From where you were at yesterday to
                  being a world traveler.

                            PENELOPE
                  It looked like fun.   I wanted to do
                  it.

                            BLOOM
                  A new hobby.

     Up ahead, Bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape
     gazing out to sea. He quickly turns Penelope away.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Here, this way.


71   EXT. SHUFFLEBOARD DECK - DAY                                 71

     The Chink and Stephen play shuffleboard.     Bloom leads
     Penelope to them.

                            BLOOM
                  Penelope, this is my brother
                  Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  Pleased to make your acquaintance.
                  Bloom's told me about you, you're
                  the epileptic photographer?

                             PENELOPE
                  Sort of.

                            STEPHEN
                  This is my personal secretary and
                  masseuse, Mrs. Yuengling.

     A nearly imperceptible glare from the Chink.

                            PENELOPE
                  Yuengling like the beer?




                                                              43

                             STEPHEN
                  Heh. No. So what are your plans
                  in Greece?

                            PENELOPE
                  I don't plan.

                            STEPHEN
                  Good for you.

     The Chink hits a damn near impossible shuffleboard shot, then
     gives Stephen a pointed deferential giggle-bow.


72   INT. STATE ROOM - NIGHT                                    72

     The brothers dress for dinner.

                            BLOOM
                  You named the Chink `Yuengling?'

                            STEPHEN
                  I was writing in a bar. And she
                  doesn't drink, how does she know a
                  Philly beer?

                             BLOOM
                  She knows a lot of stuff.
                      (beat)
                  Was that who I thought it was on
                  the East deck this morning?

                            STEPHEN
                  Yes it was. Did he spot you?

     An ominous glance.

                             BLOOM
                  Not yet.


73   EXT. DECK - NIGHT                                          73

     Several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck, Bloom
     and Penelope sit with flutes of champagne. Penelope, in an
     elegant but understated dress, shuffles a pack of cards.

                            BLOOM
                  You look very nice.

     She laughs as if at a joke she doesn't think is funny.




                                                                 44

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  What was your childhood like?

                            PENELOPE
                  I make cameras out of watermelons.

                            BLOOM
                  Lonely.

                            PENELOPE
                  Lucky guess.

     Penelope's hands move faster.     She knows how to shuffle
     cards.

                            BLOOM
                  How was it lonely?

                            PENELOPE
                  Fishing for an entertaining
                  childhood anecdote that
                  encapsulates my adult issues?

                            BLOOM
                  Well it's funny how everyone's
                  usually got one.

     As Penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her
     shuffles.

                            PENELOPE
                  When I turned six I started getting
                  allergies, hayfever, rashes, really
                  bad. So my mom took me into the
                  doctor, and he did that test where
                  they use needles to prick a grid on
                  your back with all the different
                  toxins, to see which ones you're
                  allergic to. The next day I came
                  in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,
                  and my back looked like a patch of
                  oily, moldy, blackish green double-
                  puff marshmallows. I was allergic
                  to everything. So they sealed the
                  house with plastic and a special
                  ventilation system, and I spent my
                  entire childhood and adolescence
                  indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.

     She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on
     the table.


  

                                                              45

                         BLOOM
               Wow.

                         PENELOPE
               It wasn't `til I was nineteen they
               discovered what I was actually
               allergic to was the aluminum alloy
               the hypodermic needle was made out
               of. Then I was going to leave, but
               my mom got sick. So I stayed. And
               she stayed sick, a long time.

                         BLOOM
               Do you feel cheated?

     Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.

                         PENELOPE
               The trick to not feeling cheated is
               to learn how to cheat. So I
               decided this wasn't a story about a
               miserable girl trapped in a house
               that smelled like medical supplies
               wasting her life on a dying person
               she sometimes hated. It was about
               a girl who could find infinite
               beauty in anything, any little
               thing. And do anything she decided
               to do. And love the person she was
               trapped with. So I told myself
               that story until it became true.
               Now did doing that let me escape a
               wasted life, or did it just blind
               me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
               I don't know. But either way, I
               was the one telling my own story.
               So I don't feel cheated.

     She finishes the trick.

     A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the
     far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the
     fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear
     at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.

                         THE CURATOR
               And a magician is just an actor
               playing the part of a magician.   My
               compliments.

     Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up
     and away.

                                                                 46
   




74   EXT. BOW - NIGHT                                             74

     They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship.

                         PENELOPE
               Who is that man? You avoided him
               earlier on the deck.

                         BLOOM
               I don't know, but he's carrying a
               knife up his sleeve and wearing a
               cape. Do me a favor and steer
               clear of him.

     A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen.

                         BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
               I don't suppose in all your hobby
               acquiring you ever learned how to
               dance?

                         PENELOPE
               I went through a phase when I was
               mildly obsessed with the Bolero.

                         BLOOM
               Give me a minute.

     He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows
     deepen. She shivers.

     A match strikes.   She jumps.

     The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck.
     The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match.

                         THE CURATOR
               Mademoiselle.

                           PENELOPE
               Monsieur.

                         THE CURATOR
                   (in French, subtitled)
               I didn't mean to startle you.

                         PENELOPE
                   (in French, subtitled)
               Yes you did.

                      (in French, subtitled)
                  Apologies, but the deck was dark,
                  and I had to approach.
                      (English)
                  It's been such a time since I've
                  encountered the Brothers Bloom.

                            PENELOPE
                  You're in antiques?

                            THE CURATOR
                      (Cheshire grin)
                  Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if
                  you know the true nature of the men
                  you travel with?

     The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist,
     and a long thin blade falls into his hand.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  A little fear might suit you, I
                  think.

     He raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush,
     which he delicately employs.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  Bon soir, ma cherie.

     With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone.
     Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious.

                            BLOOM
                  It isn't a Spanish band, but
                  they'll do their best.

     He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her
     teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the
     air, the Bolero suits it.

     The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in
     the dark.


75   INT. STATE ROOM - MORNING                                    75

     Bloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his
     porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea.

     His dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its
     lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth
     marks on the stem.

     Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and
     pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.




76   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                          76

     The Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a
     beer can pinhole camera between them.

     Penelope gives a lesson on how it works.

     The Chink appreciates her.


77   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK - LATER                                  77

     Bloom escorts Penelope to breakfast.

                  How'd you find her?

                            BLOOM
                  The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling?   She
                  found us.


78   INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING (FLASHBACK)                     78

     Bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe.

                            BLOOM (O.S.)
                  A few years back, when we hit the
                  top of our art dealing game, she
                  just appeared.

     A door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his
     place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette.

                            BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  She's stuck with us. We figure
                  when she gets bored she'll vanish
                  with the same lack of noise.

     Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.   She
     drinks it without looking at him.

               Good.

     They smile when they see Stephen and the Chink at a table.

     Their smiles drop when they see the Curator sitting with
     them. Bloom glares at the Curator, but speaks to Stephen.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               What's he doing here?

                         STEPHEN
               I invited him, sit down. This
               ship's too small to dance around
               each other for a week, we might as
               well have it out now. Bloom. Sit.
               Penelope, do you know our friend?

                         PENELOPE
               Only as the creepy Frenchman.

                         THE CURATOR
               Book-learned. You know languages
               but not accents, my dear. I am
               Belgian. Maxmillion Melville, at
               your service.

                         BLOOM
               Also known in certain professional
               circles as the Curator.

                         PENELOPE
               Pleased to make your acquaintance.
               What do you do?

                         THE CURATOR
               I'm a curator, presently for the
               National Museum in Prague. And
               yourself?

                         PENELOPE
               I'm an epileptic photographer.

                         THE CURATOR
               Good for you. Boys? What do you
               do?

                  We have a legitimate antique
                  reselling business.

                  We've gone straight, Max.

                             THE CURATOR
                  Pardon, but you do not ascend to
                  the grand heights of the Brothers
                  Bloom only to toss it all and sell
                  terra cotta to blue haired weekend
                  antiquers.

                             STEPHEN
                  We did.   Eat your waffles.

                            THE CURATOR
                  But Mademoiselle appears...
                  confused. Perhaps she is unawares?

                            BLOOM
                  Eat your waffles, fat man.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Unaware that the Brothers Bloom are
                  in fact the two most highly
                  respected art smugglers in the
                  western world?

                            STEPHEN
                  Were. We've been on the straight
                  for three years. So that's that.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Well, if that is that, then that is
                  indeed that. As you say.

     Penelope snaps her fingers.     Everyone looks up.

               Sorry, no, cause I noticed but I
               couldn't place it, this ship is the
               Fidele, which was the ship in
               Melville's novel "The Confidence
               Man." So that's weird.

     Everyone glances at Stephen, a little uncomfortable.

                         STEPHEN
               Huh.


80   INT. DECK - NIGHT                                         80

     Bloom paces, Stephen shuffles cards.

                         BLOOM
               I know you like to throw those
               clever little details in, but
               you've gotta watch that shit with
               her Stephen. She had a lot of time
               alone in that house, and she used
               it. She did the best Double Dutch
               Queens I've ever seen up on the
               deck last night.

                         STEPHEN
               Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed
               cards.

                         BLOOM
               She had them in her purse and cut
               them in while I was folding my
               napkin.

                         STEPHEN
               Jesus.

                         BLOOM
               That's what I'm saying. She's
               different, she knows, sometimes it
               feels like she knows everything.
               Doesn't that worry you?

                         STEPHEN
               No. But something about her is
               worrying you plenty.

                         BLOOM
               She feels like one of your
               characters.



                                                                   52

                  The day I con you is the day I die,
                  Bloom.

                             BLOOM
                  I know that.
                      (beat)
                  How did you get the Belgian, on our
                  budget?

                            STEPHEN
                  He's beautiful, right?

                            BLOOM
                  I didn't expect him to actually be
                  Belgian.

                            STEPHEN
                  I'm not sure he is.   I'm to bed.

     Stephen stands to go, then pauses.

                            STEPHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I've always protected you, right?
                  The only real danger in this whole
                  play is that you'll actually fall
                  in love with her. Look at me.
                  Don't fall in love with her.


81   EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS                                     81

     The Chink sits smoking her whittled pipe, watching Bloom
     alone on the deck. Stephen passes her, and she stops him
     with a look.

                             STEPHEN
                  Shut up.   I know what I'm doing.

     She hands him a thin piece of paper.       He looks it over.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  This came through just now?

     The paper is a telegram with the Fidele's imprint, received
     from St. Petersburg. Stephen reads it.




    

                                                                   53

     He crumples the paper, looks down at Bloom.

                  Wire him back for me. "Dear Dog

     Bloom and Penelope lie on the deck, watching dolphins.

     She says this word like she's eating chocolate:

                            PENELOPE
                  Smugglers. It's like an adventure
                  story. Whose idea was it to go

                            BLOOM
                  Mine. Stephen always loved the
                  life. Then he was almost killed on
                  a run to Jakarta, two thugs with
                  heads like canned hams worked him
                  beyond all reason.

               And I called it, that was it.

                           PENELOPE
               Scary.

                         BLOOM
               For me. Stephen enjoyed it. He
               loved the idea that we were
               internationally infamous art
               smugglers, but I think deep down,
               same as me, he felt like we were
               putting on a persona, faking it.

                         PENELOPE
               Telling a story.

                         BLOOM
               He'd love to die on a job.
               Cornered at midnight on a run to
               Jakarta. That's his dream, to tell
               his story so well it fulfills
               itself. It somehow would make it
               finally real for him.

                         PENELOPE
               That's kinda the thing we all want,
               right?

     He looks at her in the sun.

                         BLOOM
               Trying to get something real by
               telling yourself stories is a trap.
               Trust me on that one.

     With a wink, he is gone.     A beat.   Penelope stands apart.

                            BLOOM
                  My French is a little rusty, but I
                  believe he just told you `my offer
                  stands.'

     He brings her face close to hers, smoke twisting, and speaks
     unheard words low and fast.

     ancient wall, into...

                  Yeah. Medieval art bores the crap
                  out of me so I don't know it that
                  well. So that's what he does, he
                  makes pieces in his collections
                  disappear, then sells them off via
                  a trusted middleman.

                  Wonder who's his fence?

                            BLOOM
                  Probably his Spanish guy, right?
                      (asks Penelope)
                  Did he say who's buying?

                            THE CURATOR
                  A gentleman from Argentina. He's
                  quite sick, cancer in his bones,
                  and desperate for sentimental
                  reasons to own this piece while he
                  may.


93   EXT. GRECIAN PORT                                         93

                  He'll sell it to a middleman for
                  one million, US. The Argentin...a
                  guy will pay two point five.

                             STEPHEN
                  Not bad.

                            PENELOPE
                  Is he legit?



                                                                57

                            STEPHEN
                  The Curator? That's a relative
                  term. He's telling the truth.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm sorry you had to deal with that
                  guy.

     Behind Penelope, two porters load her steamer trunk into the
     back of a taxi.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Where's that cab going?

                            PENELOPE
                  The train station.

                            BLOOM
                  Where's the train going?

                             PENELOPE
                  Prague.

     Bloom breathes.

                            PENELOPE (cont'd)
                  Let's do it. Let's, just, I want
                  to try this. Let's be smugglers.
                  I think it'd be fun. We should do
                  this.

                             BLOOM
                  No.

                             PENELOPE
                  Why not?

                            BLOOM
                  Well first off, we don't have a
                  million dollars.

                            PENELOPE
                  I do, I've got, that's whatever.   I
                  mean a real reason.

                            BLOOM
                  This is real, it's dangerous, it
                  could go very bad.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think a little real danger might
                  suit me. I'm gonna do it.

               So if you want to join my smugglers

     She walks off towards the taxi.

                         BLOOM
               This is not an adventure story.

                         PENELOPE
               What are you talking about?    It
               totally is.


94   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           94

     A train roars through the night towards Prague.


95   INT. STEPHEN'S SLEEPING CAR - NIGHT                          95

     Stephen reclines, hat on his face.    Bloom paces.

                         STEPHEN
               Take it easy. She's having fun,
               that's the point of this.

                         BLOOM
               She's making a flag for our
               "smugglers gang," man. She made me
               learn a secret smugglers handshake.
               Unhealthy. This afternoon, when
               she was writing, in the observation
               car? A letter? A journal? No.
               She is getting way too into this.

     Bloom fishes a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and
     thrusts it in front of Stephen's face.

     On it are written dozens of variations in stylized fonts of
     "Penelope the smuggler."

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               She's been singing the Smuggler
               Song since Athens.

                         STEPHEN
               What Smugglers Song?




 

                                                                59

                  You know, the one from whatsit, the
                  Disney thing, that Smuggler Song,
                  the `We're a band of smugglers hey,
                  la la la la la, we smuggle by night
                  and drink by day, smugglers ho, ho

                  isn't... there isn't a Smuggler
                  Song, is there? Ok. She made up a
                  Smuggler Song. With hand motions.

                            STEPHEN
                  The whole point of this was to
                  sweep her off her feet. Let her
                  enjoy it.

                            BLOOM
                  While it lasts.

                            STEPHEN
                  Nothing lasts.

     Exit Bloom.    Stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his
     face.


96   INT. BLOOM'S SLEEPING CAR                                    96

     Bloom reads. Footsteps pound by outside. Penelope and the
     Chink run past his door. A moment later a uniformed
     ATTENDANT runs past.

     A beat, then the footsteps come back, and the girls duck into
     Bloom's cabin, slamming the door. Sacks in their teeth.

     Off Bloom's quizzical look:

                               PENELOPE
                  Smuggling.     From the snack car.

     They pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their
     sacks.

     Bloom glares at the Chink, who tries to avoid his gaze.


97   INT. SNACK CAR                                               97

     Bloom pays the SNACK CAR ATTENDANT from a stack of Euros,
     while the Chink gives him counts on her fingers.



 

                                                                 60

                             THE CHINK
                  Jameson.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm not paying for that.

     She holds up two fingers, the Attendant pours two.

                             ATTENDANT
                  Ice?

     She says no with a look, they drink.

                            BLOOM
                  She made up the Smuggler Song.

     The Chink nods.      Bloom pays for the Jameson.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I thought it was a Disney thing.


98   INT. PENELOPE'S SLEEPING CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT              98

     The lights are off. Penelope reclines on the bed, surrounded
     by empty tiny gin bottles. Drunk.

     Bloom sits on the floor, both framed in a big window looking
     out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically
     by.

                            PENELOPE
                  Gin is fuckin fruity. Have you
                  taken this train before?

                             BLOOM
                  Yeah.

                            PENELOPE
                  So this is all like fuckin
                  `whatever' to you.

                            BLOOM
                  I usually drink with the Chink in
                  the snack car, play cards.

                            PENELOPE
                  With the who?


 

                                                               61

     Oops.

                  Mrs. Yeungling. That's her
                  smuggler nickname.

                            PENELOPE
                  That's offensive.

                            BLOOM
                  I think if it were offensive to
                  her, she'd let us know.

                            PENELOPE
                  Do I get a smuggler nickname?

     Bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber
     band into Penelope's luggage.

                            BLOOM
                  No.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think you're constipated.   In
                  your fuckin soul.

     Bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this
     before giving up.

                            BLOOM
                  What?

                            PENELOPE
                  You've got a big load of grumpy
                  petrified poop up your ass, I'm
                  just calling you out on it. Yeah
                  I'm pretending I'm a smuggler, so
                  you know what? I'm a fuckin
                  smuggler. If that's your thing,
                  fuckin tell it like you own it.
                  When you've got a spotlight in
                  front of your feet, man, fuckin
                  jump into it and dance the shit out
                  of it. Stop fuckin thinking so
                  much. Enjoy the fuckin ride.
                  Fuck.

     A roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites
     the landscape, and rain starts to patter. Penelope stiffens.

                            PENELOPE (cont'd)
                  Whoa.

                Shh.    I love thunderstorms.

      Another crash. Lying on her stomach, Penelope slowly starts
      feeling something which makes her undulate. Bloom stares,
      confused.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Whoa ha. Oh ho ho. Ohhhhhh whoooo
                ha ha ha ha.

      Beneath her, the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate
      against the tracks. Another flash of lightening, the rain
      falls harder.

      Penelope writhes.   Bloom silently shrinks back in terror.

      Bloom sits drinking and playing cards with the Chink.    He
      spaces out, she snaps her fingers to wake him up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Candy-Gram. It's us, Max.

      Stephen pushes open the door, and an instant later a SHOTGUN
      BLAST takes out a chunk of the landing beside his head.

      They all dive onto the floor, piling on top of each other.

                             THE CURATOR (FROM INSIDE)
                   Who the hell are you, what do you
                   want, who the hell!!!!??

                  BLOOM                            STEPHEN
      Max! Max! It's us, Bloom,         Max! Max! It's Stephen and
      Stephen, Jesus, Max, easy,        Bloom, easy, whoa, Christ,
      whoa!                             whoa now!

      The Curator stands in the smoky apartment hallway, sloppily
      draped in a ratty bathrobe, bottle in one hand and shotgun in
      the other. He squints at them.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   Ah. Good morning. Come in. I
                   have been drinking.


107   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARTMENT - LATER                        107

      A schematic of the castle laid on the kitchen table. The
      Curator looks even worse in the light, red rimmed eyes, heavy
      skin on his face.

                             THE CURATOR
                   Here, off the Basilica, are offices
                   of administration, and beneath
                   those, an otherwise inaccessible
                   section of catacombs. And the
                   book.




                                                                 65

                             BLOOM
                   Administrative offices.    So how do
                   you steal the book?

                             THE CURATOR
                   The book is already stolen. The
                   stealing is in the bureaucracy, in
                   the filing, red tape. As far as
                   the museum is concerned, the book
                   does not exist. I am the curator,
                   I walk in, pinch the copy girl's
                   baboosh, put the book in a
                   briefcase and walk out. Tomorrow,
                   say, at two.

                             STEPHEN
                   Today.

                             THE CURATOR
                   Today is not a good day.

                             STEPHEN
                   Tomorrow. Now what about this
                   Argentinian.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (blank, then realizes)
                   Ah, the Argentine? Senor Luise
                   Belguta Rioso. I get his file.


108   INT. CURATORS APARTMENT BEDROOM - LATER                     108

      Penelope and Bloom wander into the bedroom, looking at an
      array of beautiful paintings on the wall.

                             PENELOPE
                   Gin is slow death, man.

      Stephen and the Chink poke their heads in, leaving.   The
      Curator strolls in.

                             STEPHEN
                   We'll see you back at the hotel.
                       (glances at the Curator)
                   Soon.

      They go, leaving Bloom and Penelope, who squints at an
      unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval
      forest clearing. It sits at the foot of an unmade bed.



 

                                                                    66

                   From a private collection on the
                   island of Ikaria. That one.

                             BLOOM
                   Who painted it?

                             THE CURATOR
                   I don't know.

                             PENELOPE
                   Why is it the last thing you see
                   every night, and the first thing
                   you see every morning?

                             THE CURATOR
                   That's a story. You have a minute?

      He closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the
      painting. Setting the stage.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   My daughter travelled with me when
                   she was very young, and I'd show
                   her the places and the art, all the
                   most joyous and terrifying things
                   in the world.

      Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the
      sun.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   I wanted that the world was alive
                   in the most fantastic way for her.
                   To built her a pair of wings. Make
                   these things real. But maybe more
                   than any other objet d'art, she
                   loved to hear she'd ask to hear the
                   story of the stone golem. From a
                   painting in a small private
                   collection on the island of Ikaria.

      He motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells
      the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still
      images, which we move across like a picture book.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   Well Rachel, like most monsters the
                   Golem was once a human. A boy,
                   about your age.

                          THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                And one day the boy was walking
                home, and he quarrelled, he fought,
                with a good friend of his. They
                got very angry and his friend
                pushed him a certain way and the
                boy fell and struck his head and
                died. The boy's friend was very
                sad but also very frightened. So
                instead of telling the boy's
                parents, he did something awful.
                He pulled the body into a quarry, a
                pit of broken rocks, and hid the
                boy beneath a pile of large stones.
                Well. Years went by, and the boy's
                friend became a young man, and one
                day while drinking in town (which
                in his guilt he did quite a lot of)
                he heard that a well was being
                built near the forest... with the
                stones from the quarry. He ran to
                the quarry to find it nearly
                empty... no stones, no body. He
                ran to the well where the masons
                were finishing their work. `Did
                they find anything strange in the
                quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe
                hoping they'd arrest him for the
                awful crime on the spot. But no,
                they said, motioning to the well.
                Nothing strange. Just stones.
                They left him alone there at the
                well, and he stood looking into it
                as the sun fell behind the
                mountains and twilight set the
                world in a deep, still silence.

      The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.

      Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
      that follows.

      Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges
      out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by
      the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
      pulls him back down into the depths of the well.

      Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the
      Curator, sitting very still.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                My daughter died nineteen years ago
                today. She was six. She went out
                to play one afternoon and vanished.

                The next morning we found her, in a
                stone well on a neighboring
                property. I climbed down to her,
                but slipped and broke my leg, and
                while we waited for the rescue team
                to pull us out she died in my arms.
                If you've had a child... my whole
                everything just focused down to one
                thing, to hold her and make her
                feel safe. But no matter what I
                said to her, I couldn't stop her
                shaking, crying. Her last moments
                on this earth were filled with
                terror. Of a stone golem.

      He stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                It was the first painting I
                `acquired.' I keep it maybe hoping
                some night the golem will come for
                me.


109   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER                   109

      Bloom trots out, ahead of Penelope.

                Mademoiselle.

      Bloom keeps going, anxious to leave, but Penelope lingers on
      the staircase. The Curator comes out.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                It is you I do business with, yes?

                           PENELOPE
                Right.   Oh, right.

      She gives him the envelope with the certified check. He
      shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just
      for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's.

      He lets go, and smiles apologetically.

                             THE CURATOR
                Au revoir.

                                                                 69

      Penelope and Bloom stroll home in silence through crowded,
      vibrant cobblestone streets.

                          PENELOPE
                You aren't constipated. You're
                scared. What are you scared of?

      They walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands.

      As they approach the hotel, Bloom deftly breaks their hand
      holding off. Penelope notices why.

      Bloom drinks alone, sketching Penelope's face with a pencil.
      A smell breaks his concentration.

                          BLOOM
                Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a
                cane.

      Standing behind him, a soft old man in an ashy suit and
      eyepatch. The DIAMOND DOG.

                           DIAMOND DOG
                Bloom. How long has it been?
                     (sits, orders)
                Tea.
                     (to Bloom)
                Can you believe that? Tea? Been a
                long while.

                          BLOOM
                If I call Stephen down he'll kill
                you.

                   Well then please don't call Stephen
                   down. Look at you, you're
                   terrified. C'mon now, look. Take
                   a look. I'm an old man with no
                   depth perception. You don't have
                   to be scared of me.

      The Dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   It's been a funny thing, watching
                   you boys take what I taught you and
                   eclipse me. I'm so proud to be a
                   footnote in the lives of the
                   Brothers Bloom. And you hate me.
                   The curse of all bad fathers - that
                   my presence on this earth after I
                   die will not live on the lips of
                   admiring men, but will sink into
                   the murky backwaters of my
                   children's psyches.

                             BLOOM
                   Is this profundity?   Cause you can
                   skip it.

                              DIAMOND DOG
                   Ha!   Ha ha. Piss and vinegar.

      The Dog scoots next to Bloom.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   When I first took you boys in,
                   showed you the ropes, haunting St.
                   Pete's, piss and vinegar. I still
                   crave that youthful joy. Even
                   today.

      The Dog's hand touches Bloom's leg.     There is something
      horrible about this.

      Beneath the bar, Bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife.

                             BLOOM
                   Don't touch me.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   You probably won't believe I loved
                   you boys very much.

                You're going to take your hand away
                or I'm going to break your arm,
                there's nothing between.

      He does, but Bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.

                          DIAMOND DOG
                But love, you know. We know, folks
                like us, you can always blink and
                realize that it's a fiction, and
                like Peter walking on water or
                Wiley Coyote running off a cliff,
                if you look down in doubt you'll
                fall. That's the price of our
                lives, the wax in our wings. One
                day Stephen's going to fall. It
                may be glorious, but he's going to
                fall hard and he won't be there to
                tell you what to do and protect
                you. When he's gone, remember me.

      The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom, his breath hot on
      his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on Bloom's leg.

      Bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike-

      When Bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand.
      Stephen, his eyes burning through the Dog.

                          DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                Hello Stephen.

      Stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across
      the Dog's hand.

      Waiters and porters tackle him, the Dog howls, holding his
      bleeding hand. Bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his
      pocket.


114   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL - NIGHT                                  114

      Bloom watches the Dog get into a waiting black Mercedes. For
      an instant the car's interior light shows an 11 year old boy
      behind the tinted glass, as the Dog slides in and puts his
      arm around him.

      The Mercedes drives off.

                                                                72
  




115   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                               115

      Right in front of the hotel, on the water. Bloom sips coffee
      from a china cup, spinning a paper in his hands. Stephen
      joins him, with a matching cup.

                          STEPHEN
                I'm sorry I wasn't there.

                          BLOOM
                You can't always be there.

                          STEPHEN
                No, I guess can't.

      A beat.

                          BLOOM
                That was a real tonal shift.    The
                Curator's tale.

      On one side of the paper is the sketch of Penelope, on the
      other is the con flowchart. "#12 - The Curator's Tale."
      "#14 - Castle Break-In."

                          STEPHEN
                I'm a big fan of tonal shifts. I
                didn't write it for him, though.

                          BLOOM
                He made it up on the spot?

                          STEPHEN
                I don't know.


116   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                           116

      Bloom flops into bed.   He turns and looks at the wall.

      Right on the other side of it...


117   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                   117

      Penelope lies in bed, looking at the wall also.   She closes
      her eyes.

                                                                  73
    




118   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             118

      Bloom's breathing slows.   He closes his eyes.

      A beat. Then light snoring breaks the silence, coming
      through the wall. Penelope snoring.

      Bloom smiles slightly.   What a cute snore.

      The snoring deepens slightly.

      The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and
      through the window the horizon glows with the approach of
      dawn.

      Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open,
      the guttural snoring ringing in his ears.


119   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING                          119

      Our four at the Curator's door. Bloom knocks, and they all
      step judiciously back. No response.

                           STEPHEN
                Max?

                          BLOOM
                We're a little early...


120   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARMENT - MORNING                       120

      Still and silent in the breaking light of morning.

      And totally empty.   Picked clean down to the bare walls.

      The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the
      well... broken on the floor.

      Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness.
      Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window.

                          PENELOPE
                The Golem came for him. In my
                dream. Crawled out of the painting
                and killed him in a horrible way.






                                                                74
  
120   CONTINUED:                                                120


                             BLOOM
                   Well at least he had the decency to
                   just skip out on us, not do
                   something tacky like fake his own
                   death.

      Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator
      stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (sotto)
                   You're a little early.

      Bloom quickly closes it.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't get it. If he was
                   hightailing it he could have waited
                   eight hours till we traded the
                   million for the book, and had some
                   traveling money. Well. Back to
                   antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing
                   lost.
                       (to Penelope)
                   And you got to see Prague, which is
                   nice.

      Penelope's eyes widen with realization.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.

                             BLOOM
                   You should stay in the city for
                   awhile, they have these amazing
                   puppet show opera things-

      But Stephen raises a hand to shut him up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh?


121   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - DAY                                     121

      Several empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's
      hand. All heads are slumped.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.





                                                                    75
      
121   CONTINUED:                                                    121


                             BLOOM
                   It's my fault. I can't believe I
                   left you alone with him.

      The Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper.       He glances at it.

                             STEPHEN
                   The check was cashed yesterday
                   afternoon, he'd have deposited it
                   in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen.

                             PENELOPE
                   What a waste.

      Bloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor man. What a waste.

      Bloom's expression turns quizzical.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor Argentina man. He'll
                   never see the book now, it'll just
                   rot in the catacombs. What a
                   waste.

      When Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment
      of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear.


122   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE, PRAGUE - DAY                             122

      Bloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars.
      The Chink and Stephen stand by.

                             BLOOM
                   No. No no. Can't you see what
                   happened here, there is no book,
                   we've been swindled -

                             PENELOPE
                   But maybe there is, maybe it's
                   real, we don't know!

                             BLOOM
                   It's not real, it's a con.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's my money, I'm going to find
                   out for sure. He gave us every
                   piece of information we need.

  

                                                                  76
    
122   CONTINUED:                                                  122


      She spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench.

      Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy
      right?" expression and gesture. They give him nothing back.

                             STEPHEN
                   We'd need to clear the
                   administrative offices.   Some sort
                   of disruption.

      The Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness.

                             PENELOPE
                       (to Bloom)
                   C'mon. Help me break into this
                   castle. It'll be fun.


123   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                            123

      A Barbie Doll set up in the middle of the field explodes in a
      theatrical plume of fire.

      Several others follow suit.

      The Chink pops up from behind a mound of dirt in her aviator
      goggles, cigarette dangling from her lip. She leans on a
      detonator plunger.

      Bloom, Stephen and Penelope crouch nearby, watching her work.

                             STEPHEN
                   She's an artist with nitroglycerin.
                   It's kind of her thing.

                              PENELOPE
                   I feel like I want to know more
                   about her.



                    BLOOM                            STEPHEN
      Yeah.                             Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   Check the tat.

      On the back of the Chink's neck, a few finely scripted lines
      of Chinese.






                                                                77
  
123   CONTINUED:                                                123


                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   An inky wisp of personal
                   information. We transcribed it,
                   brought it into a Chinese
                   restaurant.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's it say?

                             BLOOM
                   The literal translation is
                   something about water cranes, but
                   essentially it means "When you're
                   done with something, blow it up."


124   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - EVENING               124

      The Chink lies on the floor with Penelope, showing her how to
      build a tiny remotely detonated bomb. She slices a tiny bit
      off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a
      detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag.

      Penelope appreciates her.

      Bloom and Stephen hunker over the castle floorplan.

                             STEPHEN
                   There's a smoke detector in these
                   empty rooms in the east tower. So
                   we plant and set off a tiny -
                       (to the Chink)
                   TINY tiny, tiny charge.

      The Chink clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen. With a
      BEEP, a tiny poof of fire plumes from the handbag setting it
      on fire, and the smoke rises to the ceiling.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Fire drill ensues, offices empty,
                   and you'll have exactly four and a
                   half minutes to get through the
                   access hatch, into the catacombs,
                   get the book and get out before the
                   fire department arrives.

      Penelope and the Chink do their elaborate handshake, and she
      gives Stephen and Bloom a finger snap thumbs up.

                                                                  78
    




125   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER                             125

      Bloom and Penelope, up late at the table.     Going over the
      floorplan one more time.

                          BLOOM
                So straight down the corridor,
                again, tell me where.

                          PENELOPE
                Second left, third right, access
                hatch behind the copier, I need to
                sleeeeeeep...

                          BLOOM
                The abort code if we need to abort
                is "corned beef." For some reason.

                          PENELOPE
                Bloom, I need to sleep.

      He folds up the plans, she wraps up the brick of dynamite and
      bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an
      open handbag on the table.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Is this Yeungling's backpack?

                            BLOOM
                Yeah.

      She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside
      the front zipper compartment, and sets the tiny petri-dish
      bomb beside the handbag.

                          PENELOPE
                You know what I feel?

                            BLOOM
                Horny?

                          PENELOPE
                Scared. All my big talk.       But this
                isn't a story, it's real.      Fuckin
                scary.

      She kisses him.    He kisses her back.






                                                                 79

      The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each
      other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in
      this one simple act quickly reaches a point where as a viewer
      we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze.

      Fifteen seconds after this point, we FADE OUT.


126   EXT. PRAGUE - DAWN                                         126

      The sun arcs into the sky above the castle.


127   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN                   127

      Bloom half wakes.

      Across the landscape of the bed, Penelope sleeps.   Sunlight
      on her body and her sleeping face.

      Distant KNOCKING.     From the next room over.

      Bloom's eyes snap open.    He scampers.


128   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - DAWN CONTINUOUS           128

      In his boxers, holding trousers and shirt in his teeth, Bloom
      swings over the ledge from Penelope's window into his.


129   INT. BLOOM'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN CONTINUOUS           129

      He opens the door for Stephen, who regards him narrowly.

                             STEPHEN
                   Ready?


130   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                130

      The Chink picks up the backpack, handbag and petri dish bomb.


131   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                131

      Penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket.


132   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                         132

      A little alcove with a good view of the castle.

 

                                                               80
 
132   CONTINUED:                                               132


      Stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the
      Eastern tower. Bloom paces.


133   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        133

      An empty storage room, half under construction. The Chink
      walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag. She
      goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector.


134   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                   134

      Stephen, Bloom and Penelope are joined by the Chink.

                              STEPHEN
                   Ok.

      He looks through his binoculars again.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright?

                              PENELOPE
                   Ok.

      They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots
      off. The Chink caught it. She looks at Bloom slyly.

                             BLOOM
                   For the record, I'm still against
                   this. Why send her in alone?

      The Chink finds a way to casually smell Bloom's fingers.

                             STEPHEN
                   Because going in alone is a very
                   important thing to do. She's
                   walking into a zero security
                   tourism office during a fire drill
                   and taking a five hundred dollar
                   manuscript replica from a utility
                   crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a
                   file clerk asks if she's lost.
                   Which isn't even going to happen.
                       (to the Chink)
                   She's in position.

      He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door.

      Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin.
      She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key.



                                                                       81

      She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the
      handbag dangling at her hip.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Cause nobody's going to know we
                   were ever here.

      Bloom spots the handbag.         Something's not right.

                               BLOOM
                   Uh-

      The Chink clicks the pen.


135   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             135

      The black backpack, sitting under the smoke alarm, beeps.


136   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                        136

      A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION blows a massive ten foot wide chunk
      out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully
      dramatic ball of fire and debris.

      Screams.   Shouts.      Panic.

      Our three look up at the tower, agape.

                               THE CHINK
                   Fuck me.

      Bloom grabs the binoculars from Stephen, looks for Penelope.


137   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                      137

      Panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust.
      Penelope sees what's happened, but holds her ground.

      The unmarked door opens, and a dozen business people pour
      out.


138   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                               138

                             BLOOM
                   Don't do it don't do it Penelope
                   don't-



     

                                                                  82

                             STEPHEN
                   They're locking down the castle,
                   she won't get in.


139   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 139

      She takes a step towards the door.


140   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          140

      Bloom drops the binoculars and sprints.


141   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 141

      A burly SECURITY GUARD trots across the courtyard, herding
      tourists and smoking a cigar.

                             SECURITY GUARD
                   To ze back, no panic, to ze back...

      He blocks the office door, and sets his cigar down for a
      moment. Penelope spots it.


142   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          142

      Bloom nears the courtyard, sees Penelope up ahead.

                             BLOOM
                   Pen! Don't - abort!   Corned beef!
                   Corned beef!


143   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 143

      Penelope deftly spins the cigar 180 degrees.

      The Guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth,
      fire-side first. He howls, doubles over.

      She dashes into the door.

      Bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door, but a
      SECOND SECURITY GUARD stops him.

      Dozens more security guards swarm in. Overhead, an army
      helicopter buzzes by. Bloom stares into the doorway,
      helpless and scared.

                                                                 83
   




144   INT. TOURISM OFFICE HALLWAYS - DAY                         144

      Water rains down from the ceiling sprinklers.   Penelope
      weaves through the halls.


145   INT. COPY ROOM - DAY                                       145

      Cramped, ill lit, and with its own sprinkler.

      Penelope dashes in, shoulders the massive cold war era copy
      machine and with a Herculean effort pulls it away from the
      wall.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm in Prague. I burned a man's
                lips off to break into a castle in
                Prague.

      Revealing an access hatch.


146   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            146

      Tiny, earthy.   Penelope shuts the hatch behind her.

      Light from a barred window illuminates a rectangular shape
      lying on a stone slab. Penelope approaches the small BOOK OF
      HOURS reverently.


147   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                  147

      A full view of the castle reveals just about the worst case
      scenario. The entire area swarms with army helicopters and
      tanks, soldiers with rifles, yellow tape, news crews.

      Stephen, Bloom and the Chink sit behind the police line on
      the bridge with the rest of the crowds. Heads in their
      hands.


148   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            148

      Penelope is broken out of her stupor by heavy footsteps all
      around her, soldiers searching the castle.

      Voices right outside the hatch.   She slides the wimpy little
      bolt shut. It rattles.

      She looks up - a moldy vent in the muddy ceiling.

                                                               84
 




149   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                149

      Bloom suddenly stands.

                          BLOOM
                Wait. Wait, we're fine. She's
                fine. If the soldiers find her
                wandering the halls they'll assume
                she's a clerk, they'll just shoo
                her out. So as long as she doesn't
                do anything suspicious, she's fine.


150   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    150

      Penelope wriggles on her belly through a tin ventilation duct
      barely big enough for her. The book, encased in the plastic
      bag, hangs from her teeth.

      Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her.

      Up ahead she sees a point of light. With a gleeful grunt she
      shimmies faster - she's nearly made it!


151   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                         151

      A dozen SOLDIERS and the CHIEF OF POLICE have their eyes (and
      guns) trained on the tin ventilation duct above their heads.

      It is very very obvious not only that a person is crawling
      through it, but exactly where that person is.

      The Chief of Police pointedly coughs to get her attention.


152   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    152

      Penelope freezes.   A beat of silence.

      The tin gives way, and she plummets...


153   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - DAY                                153

      ...hitting the ground hard, then springing to her feet and
      through some knee-jerk primal instinct kicking a nearby
      soldier in the head.

      Eleven rifles cock and aim at her.




                                                                    85
      
153   CONTINUED:                                                    153


      And that's how she's caught, frozen in a kung fu stance,
      plastic bag in her teeth.

      She locks eyes with the Chief of Police.      Lets the bag drop
      from her teeth.

      And opens her mouth to speak.


154   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - AFTERNOON                               154

      The hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away
      from the castle in formation. Bloom Stephen and the Chink
      sit watching for some sign.

      Three police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of
      the bridge.

                             BLOOM
                   The Chief of Police.

      As the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding
      shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged
      mesh in the back seat.

      His face falls.

      Then Penelope spots him, points and says something.

      Very suddenly, the police car stops.

      The Chief of Police gets out.       Nods at our intrepid three.

      And opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he
      motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and
      salute her.

      He kisses her hand.

                             CHIEF OF POLICE
                       (in Czech)
                   It has been a privilege, madame, to
                   behold even briefly such a strong,
                   beautiful flower.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Czech)
                   Thank you sir, I will not soon
                   forget your kindness.

      She blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut
      back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink.

  

                                                                    86
      
154   CONTINUED:                                                    154


      The police cars drive off.

      Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it
      on a bench. A moment of victorious silence.

      Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy.

                              PENELOPE (cont'd)
                       (sings)
                   We're a band of smugglers hey,
                   la la la la la,
                   we smuggle by night, drink by day,
                   smugglers ho, ho ho...
                   Everybody!


155   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - LATE AFTERNOON                              155

      Bloom and Stephen sit among empty wine glasses.

      The Chink approaches, gives Stephen a hand gesture.

                             STEPHEN
                   Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave
                   till eight.

                             BLOOM
                   That was real.

                             STEPHEN
                   Yeah, I know.

                             BLOOM
                   Fuckin scary.


156   EXT. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                                      156

      Bloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens'
      "Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio.

      His eye catches something.       A shiny red apple on a fruit
      seller's cart.

      He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing
      the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.

      Holy shit.    He is going to steal that apple.

      Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor
      turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens.


  

                                                                   87
     
156   CONTINUED:                                                   156


      And turns.

      And sees a five year old boy.      Giving him a stare of infinite
      judgement.

      Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER.

      The vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and
      screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints,
      apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.


157   INT. PRAGUE POLICE STATION - EVENING                         157

      Stephen bails Bloom out.

                               STEPHEN
                   An apple?

                             BLOOM
                   Yeah, but it was part of an
                   epiphany.


158   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           158

      The train thunders South, towards Greece.


159   INT. TRAIN SLEEPER CAR - NIGHT                               159

      Stephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight.

      As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window
      and taps it. Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with
      two mini bottles of gin.

      He kisses her.


160   INT. SHIP STATE ROOM - MORNING                               160

      Bloom holds a sleeping Penelope, watching the sun stream
      through the window and slipping the green rubber band cash
      into her suitcase.

      A low horn blows, and Bloom's face darkens.


161   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                161

      The good ship Fidele breaks the waves, blowing its horn.

 

                                                                 88

      Stephen stands on the deck.      Bloom joins him.

                             STEPHEN
                   Mexico.

      He strolls off, leaving Bloom watching the horizon gloomily.


162   EXT. DECK - DAY                                            162

      Our intrepid four sit around a small table (except for the
      Chink, who lies on a deck chair in a bikini and Chuck
      Taylors, sunning herself.)

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh-kay. We're rendezvousing with
                   Senor Rioso's guys here, on an
                   isolated beach just south of the
                   Mexican port town Tampico. A
                   simple handoff. Penelope and
                   Yeungling will stay with the car,
                   Bloom and I will do the handing.

                             PENELOPE
                   You guys seem a little tense.

                             STEPHEN
                   Well I'm not thrilled they set this
                   in Mexico. There could be
                   legitimate reasons, but Mexico's -
                   and I don't want to simplistically
                   vilify an entire country, but
                   Mexico's a horrible place. So
                   we'll be careful.


163   EXT. MEXICO BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON                         163

      The Chink fires an automatic pistol eight times into the dead
      center of a target pinned to a palm tree. She re-loads.


164   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS                    164

      The beach sprawling below them, Penelope and Bloom meander.

      The hotel itself feels very old, red ruinous stone.

                             PENELOPE
                   Is this going to be more dangerous
                   than I think, tomorrow?


 

                                                               89

                             BLOOM
                   Yeah. You should sleep at the
                   hotel tonight, I'll stay with
                   Stephen at the beach house. You'll
                   need sleep.

      On the distant beach, following the faint rapport of gunfire,
      a palm tree falls over.

                             PENELOPE
                   I'm really happy right now.   Are
                   you?

                             BLOOM
                   Right now I am.

      She kisses him and runs off along the cliff side, singing the
      smuggler song.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Penelope...

      But she's too far away now, and the ocean is too loud. She
      can't hear him, and he can't hear her, and in another moment
      she has vanishes into the green brush and white flowers.

      Behind Bloom's pained face, the sun dips towards the beach.


165   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                  165

      Stephen packs for tomorrow, Bloom stares out the black
      window, drinking. Flower in his lapel.

      Stephen picks up the con flowchart.

                             STEPHEN
                   The last box in our last con. Let
                   them begin the beguine. How's it
                   feel?

                             BLOOM
                   She's something special, Stephen.

                              STEPHEN
                   Uh huh.

                              BLOOM
                   Can I...

      He stares at his drink.


 

                                                                    90

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Can I just have a little more time?
                   Just a few days. I want to keep
                   her, like this, I don't want this
                   to just end. Don't make me do
                   this.

                             STEPHEN
                   Be angry at me, you son of a bitch.
                   Don't be pathetic. Make you?
                   Jesus. I told you not to fall for
                   her-

                             BLOOM
                   I'm not gonna do this.

      Stephen comes very close to Bloom's face, looks him straight
      in the eye. Finds his answer.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't believe you.

      He goes back to packing.


166   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            166

      Bloom stands, the beach behind him, the glowing lights of the
      hotel before him. Growing determination.


167   EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                    167

      Bloom knocks on a door.       Penelope answers, in her bathrobe.

                                PENELOPE
                   Hey.

                             BLOOM
                   I know what I've gotta do. I've
                   gotta talk to you. Are you wearing
                   shoes?

                                PENELOPE
                   What's up?

      He pulls her out of the room.


168   INT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            168

      Bloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops.

  

                                                                91

                   Bloom.   What?

      Deep breath.

                             BLOOM
                   My brother and I are con men. All
                   things considered, we might be the
                   most respected con man team working
                   today. And everything since you
                   hit me with your Lamborghini, all
                   of this, it's all fake. It's all a
                   con.


169   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                          169

      The waves break angrily on the beach. In the distance,
      Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes
      inside and turns out the light.


170   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                          170

                             BLOOM
                   No, we were going to blow you off
                   tomorrow using the cackle bladder,
                   it's a, term, we have actors
                   playing the Argentina guy's men,
                   when we showed up the deal would go
                   bad, they would open fire on us,
                   Stephen and I would pretend to be
                   shot using blood packets, squibs.
                   That's - cackle bladder, in the old
                   days they put fake blood in chicken
                   bladders, so... So you'd escape
                   with the Chink, she'd send you off
                   with a little travelling money and
                   that would be that.

                              PENELOPE
                   Wow.

                             BLOOM
                   But that's not how this one's going
                   to end. I love you now, and I want
                   to get you out of this. I'm going
                   to do what I have to do to get you
                   out of this, away from all this for
                   good. Are you ready?

171   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                           171

      Bloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand.

                           BLOOM
                 Stephen's gone into town to prep
                 the Argentina actors. Your money's
                 at his place.

                           PENELOPE
                 Money? I don't want the money,
                 let's just leave.

      For a moment he's tempted.      The dark beach house looms ahead.

                              BLOOM
                 C'mon.


172   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                     172

      Dark. Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark,
      switches on a lamp. Click, click - it doesn't come on.

                           STEPHEN (O.S.)
                 You have to switch it on at the
                 base.

      A beat.   Bloom does.

      Stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy.     But not
      angry. Much more sad than angry.

                           BLOOM
                 So I've told her our whole play.
                 And I'm here. To take her money
                 back. How's that make you feel?

                           STEPHEN
                 Disappointed.

                           BLOOM
                 This isn't the ending you wanted?

                           STEPHEN
                 It doesn't matter now. This is the
                 way it ends. So let's get it over
                 with.

                           BLOOM
                 Where's the money?

 

                                                                    93

                               STEPHEN
                   I ate it.

                             BLOOM
                   Give me the money, Stephen.

                               STEPHEN
                   No.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't want the money.

                             BLOOM
                   He's not going to keep a single
                   piece of you.

      Stephen stands.

                             STEPHEN
                   I'm sorry you fell in love with
                   her. But she's a mark. And all of
                   this, all of it is a con. Every
                   moment you shared with her, you
                   were just playing the part of a man
                   falling in love. That's what
                   you're afraid of, right? That you
                   don't know the difference? Or
                   maybe that there is no difference.
                   That that's what love is.

                             PENELOPE
                   We're leaving.

                             STEPHEN
                       (to Bloom)
                   No. You're too scared to leave.
                   You're scared to ride off into a
                   sunset that isn't painted
                   tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are
                   beautiful but they turn into dark
                   uncertain nights. If you were
                   ready for that, you wouldn't be
                   here. The money is in my bedroom.
                   Right behind me. But in my story
                   you don't get the money or the
                   sunset or the girl.

      A long beat.       The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen.

                               PENELOPE
                   Bloom.    Let's just go.   Please.

      Bloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw.

      Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs
      Bloom's leg and brings him down.

      Then they are fighting.    Penelope watches, horrified.

      A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house
      apart, thirty years worth of a fight.

      Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet.

      Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the
      holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.

      And goes off with a deafening rapport.

      Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone.

      Penelope screams.

      Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. A dribble of
      blood out of the corner of his mouth. He half grins.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil.

      And sinks to the ground.

      Bloom's eyes glaze.    He crawls to his brother.   Takes him in
      his arms.

                             BLOOM
                I'm sorry.

      Penelope watches the brothers holding each other. Tears in
      her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not
      being a part of this moment.

      Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize
      her.

                             PENELOPE
                Bloom...

      He doesn't move from his brother.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                I'm sorry.

      She leaves.




                                                                 95

      For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms
      in the middle of the broken room.

      Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope
      walking off into the distance down the beach.

      From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a
      mask.

      Stephen stands.   Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and
      blood packets.

      Bloom steps outside.


173   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                    173

      A wood patio with steps leading down to the sand.   Bloom
      watches Penelope, now very distant, almost gone.

      Stephen comes out, pulls out a flask.

                             STEPHEN
                Hey.
                    (nothing)
                I think that was the most honest
                conversation we've ever had.
                    (more nothing)
                You actually connected on a few of
                those punches.

                          BLOOM
                Did you expect me to do it? To
                come here tonight, end it the way
                you wrote it? Or were you really
                disappointed I didn't run off with
                her?

                           STEPHEN
                I was disappointed.    But I wasn't
                surprised.

      Bloom turns and SLUGS him in the jaw.   Stephen falls to the
      sand.

                          BLOOM
                I let you do your monologue, but
                you wanna know why I did it? I did
                it so she'd never want to see me
                again. To get her away from all
                this for good.


 

                                                               96

      Without looking back Bloom walks off down the beach, in the
      opposite direction of Penelope, leaving Stephen bleeding in
      the sand, alone in the dark uncertain night.

                                                       FADE OUT.

      Penelope's home, bucolic on a lazy Spring day.

      At a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn, Penelope
      sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper.

      After awhile she raises her head, regarding what she's
      written thoughtfully. Folds it up, puts it in her pocket.

      Clicks the seemingly innocent ballpoint pen.

      BEEP.

      The mansion EXPLODES, completely.

      She walks away without looking back.

      After a beat, the plaster deer explodes in a ridiculous
      fireball.


175   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                             175

      Green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino.
      A tiny white car inches its way across the countryside, and
      up into the city.


176   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                             176

      Bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment, a bag of
      groceries in hand. He spots the white car parked out front.

      Loud shouting in Italian grows louder, until Penelope and the
      Grandmother burst out the front door. Berating each other
      with Italian curses and hand gestures.

      Penelope sees Bloom, and freezes.

                            PENELOPE
                   Hello.




                                                                97
  
176   CONTINUED:                                                176


                                BLOOM
                   Hey.

      The Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the
      groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's
      back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs-
      up of approval.


177   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                              177

      Bloom and Penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find me?

                                PENELOPE
                   The Chink.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find the Chink?

                             PENELOPE
                   She gave me her cell when we got to
                   Mexico.

                             BLOOM
                   I didn't even know she had one.

                             PENELOPE
                   I think she's kind of selective in
                   who she gives the number to.


178   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - LATER                               178

      They sit with wine and bread.

                             BLOOM
                   Why are you here, Penelope?

                             PENELOPE
                   Why did you decide to stay with
                   your brother instead of coming with
                   me in Mexico?

                             BLOOM
                   Everything Stephen said that night
                   was true.






                                                                   98
     
178   CONTINUED:                                                   178


                             PENELOPE
                   I've been doing a lot of thinking
                   the past three months. I want you
                   to consider something.

      She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and
      slides it across the table to him.

      On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized
      fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST."

      Bloom sets the paper down with a snap.

                             BLOOM
                   Go away. Everything Stephen said
                   was true. I was just playing you
                   as a mark. Everything between us,
                   none of it was real.

      She leans in close to him, her hand on his leg.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't believe you.

      It's obvious even before she kisses him that she's right.


179   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                                  179

      Bloom dials a pay phone.    He's been crying.    It rings.

                             BLOOM
                   Pick up... c'mon...


180   INT. MONTE CARLO CASINO - CONTINUOUS                          180

      Lush, Edwardian. In a private room, a card table is
      overturned. Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive
      posture, a RAVISHING WOMAN in red lunging at him with a
      curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back
      by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair
      holds his tear stained face in his hands.

      This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell
      phone chirps away.

      Annoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod.

      Stephen hastily answers it.



   

                                                                99

                   Hello?


181   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - CONTINUOUS                        181

                              BLOOM
                   How quickly can you get to
                   Ferentino?

                             STEPHEN (ON PHONE)
                   Uh... Nine-ish?

      Bloom fishes out his pocket watch.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright.

      Click. As he's putting his pocket watch back, he finds the
      stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket.


182   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           182

      Penelope plays cards with the Grandmother.


183   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           183

      Stephen and Bloom sit on the little landing outside the
      apartment.

                             STEPHEN
                   So she comes back wanting to work
                   with us. Honestly? I think we'd
                   be lucky to have her. If you
                   called me to hear my opinion on the
                   matter. Which I'm getting the
                   feeling you didn't.

                             BLOOM
                   I did what I did in Mexico to get
                   her out of all this. I would rather
                   die than bring her into the con.

                             STEPHEN
                   So maybe you want to tell me what
                   I'm doing in Ferentino.






                                                                 100

                             BLOOM
                   You knew she'd come back. What did
                   you figure she was good for,
                   another million?

                             STEPHEN
                   One point seven five.

                             BLOOM
                   We will play her again, one last
                   con, but not for money. I'm gonna
                   tell you how this one's gonna end.
                   You built us into this, you're
                   gonna fly us out, end it so she's
                   done with all of us. End it all so
                   it can't start up again.

                             STEPHEN
                   You want me to plan a con whose
                   sole purpose is to blow her off for
                   good?

                             BLOOM
                   I love her. You owe me this. I
                   don't want to turn her into me.


184   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                            184

      Penelope sleeps on a cot against the window.

      Bloom enters wearily.    Sits in a chair.   Watches her.

      In the next room over, Stephen sits in the dark.    Shuffling
      cards.

      A lovely tune sung in Mandarin Chinese plays over this,
      segueing us into...


185   INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT                                    185

      On a television screen, images of the Shanghai skyline.

      TITLE CARD - Shanghai

      A wall of monitors, which the Chink steps in front of,
      singing the climax of the song. Beautiful and sad.

      As the song ends, she sees through the spotlight Penelope,
      Bloom and Stephen at a table. Penelope waves.


 

                                                               101

      The Chink's face betrays just the slightest hint of
      disappointment.


186   INT. KARAOKE BAR PRIVATE BOOTH - LATER                    186

      The four sit with drinks.

                             PENELOPE
                   So what's the next job?

                             STEPHEN
                   Before we do the next job, we need
                   to liquidate our assets from the
                   last job.

                             PENELOPE
                   But you've got-

                             STEPHEN
                   Your money from the last job, well
                   that's profit, not capital, the
                   three of us have already split it
                   up. So step one: sell the book of
                   hours.

                             PENELOPE
                   I thought it was fake.

                             STEPHEN
                   With all your random expertise we
                   couldn't risk a flat out fake. It
                   isn't worth two point five million,
                   we could maybe catch four hundred
                   grand for it, but it's real. Who'd
                   we buy it from?

                              BLOOM
                   Minskie.

                             STEPHEN
                   Perfect, we'll sell it right back
                   to him.

      The Chink hands him a piece of paper.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   If he wasn't dead.

                             BLOOM
                   Well there's Demarco or Boyer. Or
                   Roche, if we want to go state-side.



                                                                  102

                             STEPHEN
                   All traceable. With Minskie out
                   we'd have to go deep black market
                   if we wanted to be a hundred
                   percent clear. There's only one
                   place that's deep enough for that.

      Bloom and the Chink know exactly what he's talking about, and
      they don't look happy.

                              PENELOPE
                   Where?


187   INT. KARAOKE BAR BACK ROOM - LATER                           187

                             BLOOM
                   Russia. It's like `cancer', I
                   don't even like saying the word.

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink drink in a cramped little
      concrete room adjacent to the bar's kitchen.

                             STEPHEN
                   We're obviously not going to deal
                   with real Russians. They'll be our
                   guys in a phony set up, they'll
                   take our phony book and give her
                   phony cash, a closed loop. Safe
                   and simple.

      Bloom looks to the Chink for an opinion.      Gets a blank face.

                              STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So.   We go to St. Petersburg.

      At the mention of St. Petersburg Bloom looks sharply at
      Stephen, but Stephen presses on.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   She does the hand-off with our fake
                   "Russians." But while we're
                   driving out of town, everything
                   goes bad.

      He lays a simple flowchart, drawn on a napkin - three boxes.
      He points to the first, "Penelope sells book to `Russians'"




 

                                                                103

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   We discover we were sold a
                   counterfeit book in the first
                   place, which we've now sold to
                   Russian smugglers. We discover
                   this when the Russian mob starts
                   taking us out one by one. Oh shit.

      He points to the second box, "Red Dawn."

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   First they ambush our car,
                   destroying the money. Then they
                   take me out, then the Chink, and
                   finally you Bloom, in a heroic
                   death that allows Penelope to
                   barely escape with her life.
                   Devastated but reborn with the
                   knowledge that you loved her so
                   much you died so she could live,
                   she drives off into a romantic life
                   of adventure and peril, on the run
                   from imaginary Russians.

      He points to the third box, "The End."

                   Who'd you get, anyway?

                              STEPHEN
                   Hm?

                             BLOOM
                   To play the "Russians?"

      DING.

      The elevator doors open, revealing the Diamond Dog.

                              DIAMOND DOG
                   My boys.


191   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                     191

      Empty. The Dog leans against the bar with several LACKEYS,
      waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter.
      Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area.


192   INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM                                     192

                             BLOOM
                   I don't understand. Tell me so I
                   understand. Three months ago you
                   were ready to blind the old bastard-

                             STEPHEN
                   We need someone who can pass for
                   the Russian mob to buy our fake
                   book. The Dog's got his big store
                   right here in St. Petersburg.

                             BLOOM
                   Alright, fuckin stop. You want
                   this to finish in St. Petersburg,
                   you want this to end with the Dog
                   for some what thematic something?
                   Fine but don't tell it like a
                   story, let's say it. Twenty three
                   years ago and I can still smell,
                   that blood red apartment of his,
                   the smell of that place. I hate
                   him Stephen but this isn't that,
                   this is I don't trust him.




 

                                                                  105

                   What's he gonna do? Steal our fake
                   money?
                       (beat)
                   I've thought this one out, believe
                   me. And we can't end it without
                   him. Trust me. It's gonna be ok.


193   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                       193

      The red leather suitcase on the bar.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Stephen, still the grand architect
                   with your symbols. Red for
                   temptation, white for salvation.

      The Dog opens it, revealing US hundreds.      Examines it with a
      loupe.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   Impressive, boys.

                             BLOOM
                   It's trash. There's visible cross
                   hatching in Franklin's eye.

      Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben
      Franklin's eye on the bills.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Hm.  I'll be damned.
                       (closes case)
                   Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead
                   handing over a rag bag like this,
                   it should be a steel attache.

                               STEPHEN
                   This'll   do. We'll do the drop off
                   at your   store. Make it scary,
                   think a   movie version of the
                   Russian   mafia, but don't hassle
                   her.

                               DIAMOND DOG
                   Alright.

      The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest
      on his bandaged hand.

      He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew.

 

                                                                  106

                   Take care, boys.

      Leaving his gold lighter on the bar.


194   INT. HOTEL CAR PORT - NIGHT                                  194

      The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot.

                             STEPHEN
                   So. Our fake Russian attack. One
                   small charge will simulate a bullet
                   hit, and blow out the back window.

      The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on
      the rear windshield.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So that one bang, then we roll off
                   the road. Once we get clear of the
                   car the Chink sets off the final
                   charge, incinerating the car and
                   the money in the trunk. This'll
                   all happen exactly twenty seconds
                   after we cross the main bridge out
                   of town. After the bridge.

      Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his
      jacket.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.


195   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER                                   195

      Bloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms.      The Chink is
      expressionless.

                             BLOOM
                   You've been awful quiet.

      She doesn't react.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   I'm doing this for her.

      But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall.

                                                                   107
      




196   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM                                    196

      Penelope in bed. Her door cracks open, and she sleepily
      looks up. Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway.

                          PENELOPE
                Tomorrow it all starts.

      She lifts the sheets. He gets into bed, and as she drifts
      into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her
      for the last time.

      When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready.


197   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNRISE                                 197

      The Peugeot drives into the heart of the city.


198   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG ALLEY - DAY                               198

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink parked in an alley, watching a
      doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars.

      Bloom breathes uneasily, checks his watch.

                          BLOOM
                She gives the Dog the book, he
                gives her the fake money. This is
                taking too long.

      Just then Penelope trots out.    Metal attache case in hand.


199   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - MORNING                                 199

      On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake.
      Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood.

                          PENELOPE
                He hassled me. Took forever
                looking the book over, haggled the
                price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles.

      Stephen smirks, then opens it.    The money's there.

                           STEPHEN
                Alright.   Let's get the hell out of
                Russia.


  

                                                                 108

      Bloom pulls the Dog's gold lighter from his pocket, takes one
      last glance at St. Petersburg and tosses it down into the
      lake.


200   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY - MORNING                       200

      The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun.


201   INT. PEUGEOT                                                201

      The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun.

      Bloom and Penelope in the back seat.    He looks weary.

      He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead.

      She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair.
      He breathes, closes his eyes.

      An explosion shatters the front passenger window.

      Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright.

      The bridge is still a quarter mile away.

      In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass,
      screams, tires screeching.


202   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                                 202

      A BLACK MERCEDES roars out on to the road, machine gun fire
      blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot.

      The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment
      full speed, launching into the air.


203   INT. PEUGEOT                                                203

      A moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air.     The
      brothers lock eyes for a split second.


204   EXT. FOREST BESIDE ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                   204

      The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to
      flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an
      abrupt stop against a stout tree.




                                                                   109

                             STEPHEN
                   OUT!

      They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope,
      tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car
      becomes a roiling ball of flame.

      Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees
      Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of
      the car.

      A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a
      flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches
      down to him...

      Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness.


205   INT. FOREST - DAY                                                205

      Bloom wakes. Rain splattering.       Slumped against a tree.
      Penelope hunches over him.

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Are you alright?

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Yeungling went to get another car.

                             BLOOM
                   Where's Stephen?

                             PENELOPE
                   We don't know. He was gone.

      Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car.      Runs his
      fingers over the dozens of bullet holes.

      Goes to where Stephen fell.       Lying in the grass, a manila
      envelope.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   We're going to find him. If he
                   escaped, he'll contact us. If
                   they've got him, it's for ransom.


  

                                                                110

                   Who's got him?

                             PENELOPE
                   The Russians.

      The Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching
      Bloom's face against the dark forest depths.


206   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                     206

      A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug,
      loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands
      outside.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, god please what's
                   happening. I don't know what to
                   do. I don't know Stephen please.
                   Please. What's happening. Please.

      A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot
      outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.

      But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where does she get all these cars?

      Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet
      the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.

                             BLOOM
                   If you know what's happening, now
                   would be a really good time to
                   speak up.

      She sets a suitcase down beside her.    Bloom takes this in.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   No, please. Not now. I need your
                   help here now, I don't know what to
                   do.

      The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the
      world. But she's leaving.

      She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching
      for an instant.



 

                                                                    111

      She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up
      her case and walks off.

      A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets
      in.

      Bloom looks down at the slip of paper.        A short phrase, in
      Chinese.

                               BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Thanks.

      The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a
      dramatic fireball.

      The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he
      and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave.

      Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just
      happened.


207   EXT. CHICAGO - DAY                                             207

      Illinois."

      On the corner, an unassuming Chinese restaurant.


208   INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY                                  208

                   Ah, ah yes, Mr. Bloom.      Yes, ok.

                               ALL THE COOKS
                   Blooooom!

      He puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine, which is
      spitting out a facsimile of the Chink's slip of paper.


209   INT. ST. PETERSBURG COPY SHOP - EARLY MORNING                  209

                   our own theatrical enterprises."
                   You sure?

      This phrase, written on Bloom's paper.

                             CHEF
                   And then it end with "Goodbye shit
                   head."

                                BLOOM
                   Shit head?

                             CHEF
                   But it is different meaning in
                   Mandarin, uh, endearing. "Shit
                   head" if you have affection for
                   shit.


210   EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER                             210

      The Bug parked nearby. Penelope sits on the curb, crying.
      Bloom sits next to her.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it mean?

                             BLOOM
                   I don't know.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it say?

                             BLOOM
                   "We're all of us marks in our own
                   cons." And she said goodbye.

                             PENELOPE
                   I still can't believe it.

                             BLOOM
                   That the Chink fell for a car bomb?
                   Neither can I.

                             PENELOPE
                       (hopeful)
                   What? Oh, oh god do you think she
                   faked it? So the Russians would
                   think she was dead?



                                                                   113

      Bloom stands, paces away. He leafs limply through the manila
      folder - addresses, pictures, information...

      A paper with the Dog's photo clipped to it.       An address in
      St. Petersburg.

      The napkin Stephen wrote the con flowchart on.      The third box
      - "The End."

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   What do we do now?

      Scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope - "An unwritten
      life." Bloom's face clears. He wipes his eyes.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.

      Bloom goes to the Bug.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where are you going?

                             BLOOM
                   This wasn't Russians. This was
                   done by an old mentor of ours who
                   wants us off the map. He has an
                   apartment in St. Petersburg. So
                   this is, yeah. I've gotta go back
                   to that apartment to face the Dog
                   and get my brother back. That's
                   how I'm gonna end this.

      Penelope's eyes gleam. She jumps up to the passenger door,
      and Bloom stops her with a weary look.

                             PENELOPE
                   We can skip the whole you-sending-
                   me-nobly-away-and-me-refusing-to-
                   leave-your-side-thing.

                             BLOOM
                   Thank Christ.


211   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - LATE MORNING                     211

      A narrow alley between tall apartments.    Bloom parks, pulls
      his gun and checks it.




  

                                                                     114

                   If there are shots you run to the
                   car and drive, with or without me.


212   INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - DAY                                   212

      A badly lit apartment hallway.       Bloom approaches a door,
      Penelope behind him.

      His breathing becomes hard.        His face contorts.   He crumples
      next to the door.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's in there? Tell me who this
                   guy is.

      Bloom's breathing steadies.

                             BLOOM
                   He's just an old man.

      He tries the knob.     It opens.


213   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - D                                213

      Blood red walls.

      Dark, neglected and to all appearances empty.       Bloom creeps
      down the darkened corridor, gun outstretched.       Breathes
      through his nose, chokes.

                              BLOOM
                   Dog!   I came back.

      He kicks open a door, revealing a large living space.         Empty.

      He lowers his gun, switches on the light.

      Penelope enters.     Sniffs the air.

                             PENELOPE
                   Moth balls.

      Bloom almost laughs.

                             BLOOM
                   Is that what that smell is?

      BAM! A closet door smacks open, revealing the business end
      of a double barrel shotgun.

    

                                                                   115
      
213   CONTINUED:                                                    213


      Bloom spins, gun drawn.      Penelope screams.

      Then a moment of stillness.       The shotgun barrel quivers.

      It's held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dog's
      Mercedes in Prague. Malnourished and scared.

      Penelope approaches him slowly.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Russian)
                   It's okay. Honey, it's alright.

      The shotgun sinks to the ground.      Penelope strokes his hair
      back from his face.

      Bloom lowers the gun, trembling.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him if anyone else is here.

      She does.

                             BOY
                   Nyet.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him where the Diamond Dog is.

                             PENELOPE
                   Diamond Dog?
                       (in Russian)
                   Where is the Diamond Dog?

                             BOY
                       (in English)
                   The Dog of Diamonds is gone.

      Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room. As he
      does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and
      gets a quick answer.

                             BLOOM
                   Get the car started.

                             PENELOPE
                   What about him?

                             BLOOM
                   It's alright.



  

                                                               116

      She believes him, and goes.   Bloom kneels in front of the
      boy.

                          BLOOM (cont'd)
                You don't need to be afraid of him
                anymore. Or angry at him. Or ever
                come back here again. He doesn't
                concern you anymore. Understand?
                It's gonna be ok.

      The boy nods. Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in
      the green rubber band. The boy snatches it and runs off.


214   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY                             214

      Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two
      things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black
      Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her.

      He sprints towards her, screaming

                           BLOOM
                Get out!   Get out of the car!!

      She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down.

      A hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes
      through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope
      with glass.

      The Mercedes roars off down the street.

      Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open.

      Penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian
      nesting doll.


215   INT. BUG - LATER                                             215

      The seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back
      seat, Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll, and
      Penelope holds a note.

                          PENELOPE
                It's a ransom note. It says they
                have Stephen, it says they want the
                money wired to a specific account,
                they give a bank to do it at and a
                manager to ask for.

                   p.m. In two hours.

                             BLOOM
                   I'll wire the money from my
                   account, and we'll go get Stephen.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's a lot.

                               BLOOM
                   How much?

                             PENELOPE

                   How much are they asking for?

                             PENELOPE
                   One point seven five million.

      A cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach.

                              BLOOM
                   Oh.   Oh oh. No no NO.

      He punches the dashboard.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   No I'll kill him. I'll kill him if
                   that's what this is, if that's all

                   This might all be a con. By my
                   brother. To get me - oh god - he
                   wanted me to face the Dog, to end
                   it, and he gets your money. Oh

216   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG BANK - DAY                              216

      Bloom sits in the car, alone. He punches the dashboard
      again, helpless enraged and scared.

      Penelope gets in, looks at the address on the note.

                          PENELOPE
                Ok.


217   EXT. BURNED OUT THEATER - DAY                               217

      Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the
      impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater.

      The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50.

                           BLOOM
                I'm so scared. Anything I can
                imagine finding in there, I'm
                scared of.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm going to be here when you come
                out.

      She kisses him.

      He puts his hand on the door.    Hesitates.   Then goes.

      Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door.
      Goes in alone.

                                                               119
  




218   INT. THEATER LOBBY                                            218

      No lights. Moldy dust. A genuinely creepy place.      Bloom
      steps lightly, deeper into the theater.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!


219   INT. THEATER AUDITORIUM                                       219

      A few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the
      broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage.

      Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!

      A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's
      face. He spins, trapped in its glare.

      A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian.

      When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few
      feet ahead of him towards the stage.

      Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and
      finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.

      With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it.


220   INT. THEATER BACKSTAGE                                        220

      Giant fossils of antique stage scenery. Utility lights high
      above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged
      forms of light and black.

                          BLOOM
                    (unsteady)
                Stephen. Game's up. Come on out.
                Let's blow this one hat town.

      Silence. Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly
      lighting Stephen's face.

      Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood.

      Bloom cries and rushes towards him...




                                                                120

                              STEPHEN
                   No!   No Bloom, freeze.

      He obeys. Stephen is tied to a chair. A dark figure behind
      him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, who is it?   Is it the Dog?

                             STEPHEN
                   Did Penelope wire the money?

                              BLOOM
                   Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   They're calling to check right now.
                   Don't move. I'm alright.

      The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear
      for a moment then flips it closed.

      Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily
      stands, cut loose.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm
                   coming to you.

      He takes a couple wobbly steps.

      Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun
      towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer...

      And the utility lamp switches off.

                              BLOOM
                   No!

      Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into
      the blackness.

      Stephen drops flat to the ground.

      The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness,
      strobing the scene like stage lightning.

      Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen
      lies on his stomach out in the open.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Stephen!



                                                                 121

                              STEPHEN
                 Stay back!

      But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open,
      unloading three more rounds into the dark.

      The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full
      on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.

      Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.

      Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red
      burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.

      Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind
      him.

      He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,
      through the torn backdrop.

      Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires
      after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
      lobby.

      Silence.

      Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat,
      breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.

                           BLOOM
                 Please tell me this is all gonna be
                 ok. Tell me that's a squib, and
                 that's makeup, and that you just
                 gave me what I always wanted and
                 pulled off the perfect con.

      A long, long moment.

      Stephen coughs, spits.     Then a wry grin spreads across his
      face.

                           STEPHEN
                 You said it, not me.

      He stands, the shakiness gone.

                           STEPHEN (cont'd)
                 Can I get a `wow' for this one?

                           BLOOM
                 You son of a bitch.




                                                               122

      Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he
      embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for
      a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.

      Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.   He wipes
      them, wipes blood from his lip.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil. Alright
                here's what I want you to do. The
                Chink split?

                           BLOOM
                Yeah.   Clean exit.

                            STEPHEN
                How?

                            BLOOM
                Car bomb.

      A hint of relief in Stephen's face.

                          STEPHEN
                Good. Here's what. Take Penelope
                back to Helsinki, take that flight
                to Rio. Lay low like we said.
                Play out the on-the-run-from-
                vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be
                fun for her. Play it like I'm
                dead, actually - that'll add some
                gravity to everything, that'll be
                nice. And I'll see you when I see
                you.

                            BLOOM
                Soon?

                          STEPHEN
                I hope not. Last thing you need is
                me hanging around. Anyway, how
                could I top this?

      Bloom hugs him again.

                          BLOOM
                I love you. Bye.

      He turns to go.

                            STEPHEN
                Hey.    Think of any card.



                                                               123

      Stephen pulls out a pack of cards.

                              BLOOM
                 Alright.

      Stephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts.

                           BLOOM (cont'd)
                 Stephen. That's it.
                     (grins)
                 That's the best card trick I've
                 ever seen. I just wish you had a
                 bigger audience.

                           STEPHEN
                 You're the only audience I've ever
                 needed.

      Wink.   Bloom leaves.

      Stephen watches him go.


221   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON                      221

      Rumbling towards Finland.

      In the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives.

      She looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with
      Stephen's "blood." She strokes his shoulder sadly.

      Off Bloom's sleeping face...


222   INT. THEATER STAGE                                        222

      Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in
      the spotlight's glare.

      Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world.

      Sits.   Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over
      it.

      Then slides is up his sleeve.

      Blood trickles down his hand.

                                                                  124
     




223   INT. BUG - SUNSET                                            223

      Bloom wakes with a start.

                            PENELOPE
                  Hey. Hey, it's ok. The bridge is
                  coming up, we're almost at the
                  border. Were you dreaming about
                  Stephen?

      She strokes his hair back from his face.

      He nods, and looks down at his sleeve.

      Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff.

      Now a dark shade of brown.

      Bloom looks at this shirt.      All the blood, it's all brown.

      He looks up at the road, nearly panicked.

      Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge.

                               BLOOM
                  Pull over.     Pull over!!

      She does.

      He bursts out of the car, and run/tumbles down the grassy
      hillside till he finds the car tracks.

      He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot.

      Penelope stumbles down after him.

                            PENELOPE
                  What is it? You're scaring me-

                            BLOOM
                  What did you ask the Russian kid,
                  in the Dog's apartment? He said
                  the Dog isn't here, then what did
                  you ask?

      Bloom kicks open the trunk.      Pries open the blistered attache
      case.


 

                                                                125

      Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money
      from the "Russians" till he finds what he was looking for and
      brings it out into the dying light.

                             PENELOPE
                   How long had he been alone.

                             BLOOM
                   And what did he say?

      A scrap of unburned money.    A fragment of Ben Franklin's
      face.

                             PENELOPE
                   Since yesterday morning.

      A single eye gazing up at him, the green grass behind it.

      The eye is perfect.    No cross hatching.

      Bloom sinks to his knees.

                             BLOOM
                   This is real. They hassled you.

                             PENELOPE
                   Bloom-

                             BLOOM
                   The Dog was gone before we got
                   there. They hadn't cleared out of
                   their apartment, they had been
                   cleared out.


225   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - DAY FLASHBACK                 225

      RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men
      with silenced pistols.

      The BOY shuts himself in the closet, terrified.


226   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                       226

                             BLOOM
                   Real Russians. Took his store.
                   They didn't know about his deal
                   with us, but you haggled with them.
                   You really sold the book to real
                   Russians. The Diamond Dog was
                   gone.

                                                              126

      The scene beside the lake, our four heroes checking the money
      in the attache case.

                          STEPHEN
                Let's get the hell out of Russia.

      Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake.    We
      follow it, plunging beneath the surface.

      Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog
      sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck.


228   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                      228

                And they came after us.   And
                Stephen...

      Penelope holds him tight.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                          BLOOM
                Stephen saved my life.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                             BLOOM
                He's gone.

      Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him.
      She holds his crying face up.

                          PENELOPE
                And he did it so you could live.
                Your brother loved you. He loved
                you so much. Look at me. Stephen
                said something once, I got the
                feeling he'd rather be telling it
                to you. He said there's no such
                thing as an unwritten life. Just
                badly written ones. I love you.

                   Russian mafia, and we're gonna hide

                   like we're telling the best fucking
                   story in the world. Are you ready?

      She holds his face close to hers for a long beat. Then
      smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill.

      Bloom watches her.

      Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and
      holds out her hand for him to follow.

                             BLOOM (V.O.)
                   I was thinking of something Stephen
                   said too. "The perfect con is one
                   where everyone involved gets just
                   the thing they wanted." Well.

      He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point
      of light breaking over the hill.


229   EXT. HIGHWAY - SUNSET                                      229

      Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead.
      The rumbly old VW chugs away from us, towards the horizon.

Soft music. A classy joint. Below the tables, WE PAN
           well-heeled feet nuzzling. Finally we SETTLE ON: 
                         
                         
           A PAIR OF FEET
                         
           WHITE SNEAKERS sitting opposite FANCY HIGH HEELS. These
           feet aren't nuzzling. There's distance here.

           Well, I'm full. You were right,

           JESSICA (17) chases after MOLLY (9). Jessica's skinny,
           wears glasses, a hipster T-shirt. In five years, she's
           going to make all the boys' heads spin. But not yet.

           She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with 
           delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the
           nearby console. Jessica picks it up:

           Alright, kiddo, it's getting late,

           I don't care. I love him and

           She looks at him. He turns to her, about to say
           something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward.

           Still driving, Tracy looks at Cal. He remains silent.
                         
                          TRACY
           I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not
           to be. We've been married so
           long, somewhere we became...
           stagnant, you know?
                         
           He keeps staring straight ahead.
                         
                          TRACY 
           Okay, you're not talking and you 
           know that only makes me talk more. 
           Maybe that's good, maybe that's 
           good. Okay...

           kept asking the decorator how he

           She touches his bloody forehead, affectionate. There's
           still something here.

           listening.
                         
           She smiles, turns back. She freezes when she sees...
           He's holding CASH out the window to pay her.

           And with a sad wink, he drives off -- leaving her
           standing there, lovelorn and forty-five dollars richer.

           You know these places: basically a "strip" of identical 
           housing units -- usually occupied by newly-divorced dads. 
                         
           A WOMAN (60s) gives Cal the tour.

           So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2 
           is a lot like unit 1 except you're 
           downstairs so... the ground is 
           closer. Which is nice.

           absolutely exhausted. He looks across the bar. 
                         
           At his usual table, Jacob is now wooing a NEW WOMAN. 
                         
           Cal shakes his head, amazed at this guy's chutzpah. A

           dumped this whole time. 
                         
           He PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad
           navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting,
           untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair.
                         
           Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something 
           to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods, 
           gets up and walks away. 
                         
                         
           BACK TO CAL
                         
           As the Bartender pours him a second shot. He's now 
           showing pictures from his wallet to the Bartender.
                         
                          CAL
           This is my youngest, Molly. Her
           two favorite things are High
           School Musical and her mother. I
           hate both of her two favorite
           things.
                         
           A SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob.
                         
           Jacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob
           makes is practiced, perfectly cool.

           Cal points at himself: "Me?" Jacob nods: "Yep." Cal
           SHRUGS, stands, and wobbles over towards Jacob.

                          CAL
           I already have a drink.

           David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've
           heard. We've all heard. For the
           last two nights, I've watched you 
           batter every poor soul in this bar
           with your sad-sack loser sob
           story.
                         
           Cal takes this in. He STANDS.
                         
                          CAL
           You know what, I don't need this

           Okay.
                         
           Cal sits. Jacob's that powerful. Cal's that drunk.

           Cal, I'm going to make you an
           offer, it's probably the best
           offer you're ever going to get,
           and you're extremely drunk, so
           it's wildly important that you
           don't answer until I've finished
           and you've taken a few moments to
           process what I'm saying. Do you
           understand?
                         
           Cal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger. Cal stops
           himself. Once he's settled, Jacob continues:
                         
                          JACOB
           As I said, I've been watching you
           for two days now and I can say, 
           without hesitation, that you are
           the sorriest man I've ever seen in
           my life -- don't interrupt, Cal,
           it's the truth, and you need to
           hear it. You're sitting there
           with your Supercut haircut,
           getting drunk on watered down
           vodka-cranberries like a fourteen-
           year-old girl, wearing a 41R
           jacket when you should be wearing
           a 40L -- I don't know if I want to
           help you or euthanize you
           -- stop drinking out of the
           goddamn straw, Cal. 
                         
           Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw. 
                         
                          JACOB
           You asked me for advice before, 
           Cal, so I'm going to help you. I 
           don't know why. Maybe I'm just
           bored. Maybe all my friends have
           abandoned me for wives and
           children and labradoodle puppies,
           who cares why? Why doesn't
           matter. The point is, you've got
           a good face, and a good head of
           hair, and I'm bored as hell and
           need a project. So if you want,
           I'm going to help you rediscover
           your manhood. Do you remember
           when it was that you lost it? 
                         
           Cal shakes "no."

           Doesn't matter, we'll find it.
           And when we do, when I'm through
           with you, that wife of yours is
           going to rue the day she decided
           to give up on you too early.
           That's my offer. What do you say?
                         
           Cal stares at him blankly. A long beat of silence. Cal
           goes for a drink, almost uses the straw... then catches
           himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up.
                         
                          CAL
           Yeah, okay.

           I'm sorry, what?
                         
           Jacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN (now nearby). 
                         
                          JACOB
           You ready to go? 
                         
           She nods, subservient, and follows him out.
                         
           Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the
           rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw.

           A well-maintained yard, bordered by shrubs and bushes. A 
           long driveway runs parallel to the yard. A medium-sized 
           U-HAUL is parked in the driveway. 
                         
           Cal EXITS the back door, carrying a BOX. He loads it

           A weathered playground sits off to the side. You can 
           tell it hasn't been used in quite some time. Baseball 
           equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son 
           catches. An oft-used barbecue next to the house.

           Cal looks up. Tracy approaches. She's wearing sweats. 
           It's pretty obvious that she's been crying. Awkward 
           silence. Neither knows what to say. 
                         
                          TRACY

           Shit. 
                         
           She gathers herself. Cal steps forward. Instinct tells 
           him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops 
           himself. She realizes this. There's something harsh and 
           complicated about the reality of it all. 
                         
           Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to 
           lighten things.

           We'll start with shoes. Let me
           see those sneakers you're wearing.

           Take them off.

           Cal does as he's told. Jacob holds out his hands. Cal
           SHRUGS, hands Jacob the shoes.
                         
           Jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing.

                          JACOB
           You see that, Cal? The simple act
           of opening your mouth instantly
           causes Tiffany to lose interest in
           sleeping with you. Your
           personality is actually your
           weakest link.
                         
           Cal takes this in.
                         
                          CAL
           Well, that's the meanest thing
           anyone's ever said to me.
                         
                          JACOB
           No, Cal. The meanest thing
           anyone's ever said to you is this:
           your wife cheated on you because
           you lost sight of what it took to
           keep her content at home -- as a
           man, as a husband, and probably as
           a lover.
                         
           Cal's lower lip begins to quiver.

           Cal sits next to Jacob. Cal is wearing his new "outfit." 
           He looks great, but not yet comfortable in his new 
           "gear."
                         
           Jacob, on the other hand, looks like he's walked out of a
           men's magazine. And he knows it. Cal looks at Jacob. 
                         
                          CAL
           I notice you only button your
           shirts up, like, halfway. I can't
           pull that off, right?
                         
                          JACOB
           No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be 
           calling women over to our table
           shortly.
                         
           Cal rubs his hands together, nervous.
                          
                          CAL
           We should have some background on

           Cal, the only thing I care less
           about than corporate insurance are
           your kids. Here's the only thing 
           I need to know: how many women
           have you been with?
                         
                          CAL

           Yes.

           No, synchronized swimming. Yes, 
           Cal. Sexually. 
                         
           Cal thinks. He MUMBLES to himself, counting it out on
           one hand.

           One.
                         
           Jacob CHORTLES. But Cal just stares at him blankly.

                          CAL
           Tracy was so damn beautiful. You
           know those women, the ones who can
           be wildly sexy and unbelievably
           cute all at once? I never knew
           how she did that. I still don't
           know how she does it.

           who fell in love, like assholes,
           and then had to die, like
           assholes. I'm sorry for cursing.

           Tracy works at her desk. A KNOCK at her door interrupts. 
           A TALL MAN (40's) stands there: DAVID JACOBOWITZ.

           Oh, David. I'm just a little 
           swamped right now so... 
                         
           He closes the door behind him.

           You ran away in the other 
           direction when you saw me coming 
           down the hall yesterday. 
                          (BEAT) 
           You're very fast by the way.

           I ran track in high school.

           I'm also not sorry, if I'm being 
           completely honest. 
                          (GATHERING HIMSELF) 
           I want to make sure you know how 
           much I like you.

                          DAVID JACOBOWITZ 
           A lot. Just to clarify. I like 
           you a lot. I had no intention of 
           falling for a married woman. I 
           just wanted someone to go to lunch 
           with who didn't make me want to 
           shoot myself in the face. But we 
           started having lunch, and talking, 
           and suddenly I was an accountant 
           who was popping out of bed in the 
           morning, excited to get to work. 
           That doesn't happen to 
           accountants. Ever. I've checked 
           with other accountants. 
                         
           She smiles.

           So when the time is right for you 
           to get back out there again, 
           officially, I just... I'd like to 
           throw my hat in the ring. 
           Officially. That sounded weird. 
                         
           Tracy LAUGHS lightly, leans forward. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           David, you've been a great friend 
           to me. And you were the first man 
           in a very long time to make me 
           feel... noticed, I guess? What 
           happened between us that night... 
           it meant something to me. You 
           weren't the only one excited to 
           come to work lately. 
                         
           David smiles. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           But now, when I see you, all I see 
           is his face. All I see when I 
           look at you is what I did to my 
           marriage. 
                         
           She's losing it, wipes her eyes. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           You see this? I'm saving you from 
           disaster, David, `cause you're 
           asking to pre-board the Titanic. 
           Honestly, do you really want any 
           part of this? 
           Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone.

           scribbles something on a postcard, EXITS.

           Of course, right away. 
                         
           She HANGS UP, looks at the Post-It. It reads, simply:

           have to get back to work.
                         
           They walk out together.

           It's an older picture of CAL AND TRACY. They look happy.

           today, I had a meltdown, almost
           gave up on the love of my life.
           My dad's having his meltdown now, 
           but long-term? He won't stop
           fighting for my mom any more than
           I won't stop sending Jessica texts
           that make her uncomfortable. And
           you need to know that.

           Tracy waves to David as she and Robbie EXIT, leaving him 
           stunned in the middle of her office, staring at: 
                         
           THE PHOTO OF CAL AND TRACY that Robbie has left directly
           in his line of sight.

           Bushes rustle. Once, then twice. It's Cal, sneaking 
           into the backyard. He takes a covert look inside the 
           house. All is quiet. He gets to work. 
                         
           -- He spreads FERTILIZER on the grass.

           It's the strangest goddamn thing you've ever seen.

           Content. His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back 
           in order. As he takes it all in...

          46 INT. BAR - THAT NIGHT 46
           Another night at the bar: Cal's in his position, Jacob
           in his. Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward.
                         
           Jacob looks at Cal. Cal looks great, more comfortable in
           his new "skin" than when we left him. He's drinking a
           martini, rather than a red-strawed vodka cranberry.
                         
           A WAITRESS passes. Without speaking, Cal taps the rim of
           the glass, silently requesting a refill. It's a cool,
           practiced move... and he did it instinctively.
                         
           Jacob smiles, leans forward.

           Cal, do you remember the part in
           Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps
           having the kid wax the car and the 
           kid gets all bent out of shape
           because he doesn't see the point,
           but the movements were actually 
           building blocks for throwing and
           blocking punches?

                          CAL
           You ask if you can buy her a
           drink.

                          CAL
           You order her a drink anyway, let
           it sit there.

           Don't send it to him as a jpeg,

           Listen, Dad. I love you. I have

           honest here: the woman told you
           she wanted a divorce and you

           need of some romantic inspiration.

           One of them is telling a story:
                         
                          WOMAN
           And you know what she said?
                         
           JACOB (O.S.)
           What? What did she say?
                         
           The women look up.

           Standing there, in all his glory. He flashes his coolest
           smile. They melt. We've seen this before.

           She's dripping wet from the rain, looking almost wild.
                         
           She scans the room, quickly, searching for...

           She spots him, marches straight to him.
                         
           For the first time, he looks like a deer in the 
           headlights.
                         
           She grabs him. Kisses him. A long, deep, almost angry
           kiss. She pulls back.

           We haven't been here yet. It's exactly what you'd expect
           though: an elegant bachelor-pad. Modern furniture.
           Sleek. Everything just right. Jacob puts an album on 
           his record player.

           Is that a compliment?
                         
                          HANNAH
           I'm not sure.
                         
           Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones.
                         
                          HANNAH
           I like this song.

           Yes, please.
                         
           Jacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. Brings
           them (and the bottle) over towards the couch.
                         
           He pats the couch. Hannah nods, walks over, sits down.

           They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She 
           holds out her glass for a refill.
                         
           Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she

           She takes a deep breath, admits:

           Hair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing.
           And then... Jacob does the most unexpected thing:
                         
                          JACOB
           Do me a favor. Ask me a question
           about myself.
                         
                          HANNAH
           What? No! I don't want to know
           anything about you.
                         
                          JACOB
           C'mon, one question.
                          
                          HANNAH
           Okay, fine, but then we bang.
                         
                          JACOB
           Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll
           answer anything. You can ask me
           about my job, or past

           The question takes him by surprise. He hesitates, then:
                         
                          JACOB
           Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but
           cold. Very cold.

           She motions at his abs.

           And time for stuff like that?
                         
           He LAUGHS.
                         
                          JACOB
           My dad was the opposite of my mom,
           actually...
                         
           We PULL BACK as they continue chatting.
                         
           TIME PASSES, as one question leads to another, and then
           another.
                         
           Body language shifts.
                         
           -- Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from
           the bottle, just talking. Then kissing. Then lying on
           their sides, face-to-face, talking some more.
                         
           -- Until finally: it's Jacob who passes out. And it's
                         
           Hannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on
           the forehead, and begins falling in love with him.

           He notices, switches plates. 
                         
           She smiles. He smiles. God, he's crazy about her. 
                         
           He looks at the next table, watches a LOVELORN GUY switch

           Now it's Hannah who's asleep in bed, and Jacob who stares 
           at her lovingly. Suddenly, he catches himself. 
                         
           In a series of COMEDIC JUMP-CUTS, he wrestles with the 
           implications of what's happening to him. 
                         
           -- Pacing. A drink. A big drink. Fingers pulling at 
           his own hair. Hyperventilating. More staring. More 
           pacing.

           a blanket, kisses her forehead, and finally... 
                         
           Gives in to falling in love with her.

           Tracy sits at a table, FLOWERS off to the side. Her 
           phone rings. She looks at it, sees it's "Cal." She hits 
           IGNORE.

           the front door. She's carrying those same flowers. 
                         
           Awkward beat.

           David, stop. Look, I had a nice 
           time, which is a substantial 
           upgrade from the rest of the... 
           times I've been having lately. 
           So, I don't think I'm ready to 
           start dating but my ex clearly is 
           and there's a yogurt shop where 
           they make this eight calorie ice 
           cream that tastes like a laxative, 
           so if you'd like to take me there 
           sometime I guess I wouldn't say 
           no.

           uncanny. 
                         
           They LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry. 
           Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then...

           eyes open so they can hear what 
           Dad had for dinner, or how he 
           liked the movie. Lot of kids want 
           to stay awake for Mom -- and your 
           kids always want to see you, don't 
           get me wrong -- but not a lot wait 
           up for Dad. Maybe it's because

           front. She looks at the note. It reads: "Just give me 
           a chance, love David J" but the "David J." has been 
           crossed out and replaced with "Robbie." 
                         
           She shakes her head, takes the flowers, closes the door. 
                         
          79 EXT. THE WEAVER BACKYARD - LATE EVENING 79 
                         
           MUSIC CONTINUES as we spy the Weaver family through their 
           windows: Robbie plays video games in his room. Molly 
           watching her show in hers. Tracy in the kitchen. 
                         
           We MOVE DOWN the house, and OUTSIDE, where we discover: 
                         
           Cal in stealth mode, tending to his backyard. He 
           fertilizes, trims and waters. All under cover of night. 
                         
           TRACY (O.S.) 
           Kids! Ice cream! 
                         
           Cal looks into the living room. Tracy has brought out 
           ice cream: a carton with three spoons. The kids race 
           down the stairs, join her, and start eating. Laughing. 
                         
           We take in the real-time TABLEAU: 
                         
           Cal's wife and children -- his family -- inside. Cal: 
           watching them from the outside, looking in. 
                         
           It's touching. It's complicated. It's horribly painful. 
                         
           INSIDE... Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something. 
           She steps into the KITCHEN, closes the door, and DIALS 
           her phone. Cal leans toward the window, suspicious. 
                         
           OUTSIDE... Cal's phone rings. He jumps to silence it.

           Hi, Cal. 
                         
           Silence. Cal is looking at her inside. She has no idea.

           So... I'm in the basement. I'm 
           trying to get the water heater 
           working `cause the pilot's out and 
           I don't know how to relight it.

           Molly is once again absorbed in High School Musical.

          87 EXT. WEAVER HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT 87 
                         
           Tracy pulls up to her house. As she pulls in she notices 
           Robbie. He's standing outside the front door in a 
           tuxedo... a shit-eating grin on his face. 
                         
           She SIGHS ("what now?") and parks the car.

           some underwear in Jessica's bottom drawer.
                         
           Notices something. An envelope. It's addressed to Cal
           Weaver. Curiosity piqued, she picks it up. Looks
           inside. Almost faints.

           Big Bernie sits in a recliner, watching football and 
           drinking a cold one. Jessica lies on the floor, doing 
           homework.
                         
           Claire ENTERS, ashen. Zombie-like, she hands Bernie the
           envelope. Jessica looks up, sees it. 
                         
                          JESSICA

           Bernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the
           envelope. He looks at the envelope again.

           Bernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out
           the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY.

           wearing a tuxedo, he's carrying a bunch of SCARVES. 
           Tracy LAUGHS.

           She can't help but smile. She kneels down, allowing
           Robbie to BLINDFOLD HER from behind.
                         
           He ties a SCARF around her eyes. Then ANOTHER at a

           frightening. He looks down at passenger seat. At the
           ENVELOPE bearing Cal's address.
                         
           He RACES through a light. A HORN blares behind him.

           What's happening?
                         
           Bernie is pummeling Cal.

           Bernie picks up a WINDMILL from the miniature GOLF

           throws herself on Cal.

           Look, I'm just gonna write

           They EXIT. Cal lets them go, then grabs his things.

           Cal sits back at his usual table. This isn't "Cool Cal,"
           the Jacob disciple. No, this is "Sad Mess Cal." He's 
           grown a patchy beard. He's wearing a ratty sweatsuit. 
                         
           He's drinking, once again, vodka-cranberry out of a wimpy 
           red straw. It's pathetic. A WAITRESS APPROACHES.
                         
                          WAITRESS
           Can I get you another?

           2:30 would have been sufficient
           but I appreciate the judgment,
           Cocktail Waitress.
                          (THEN)
           Yes, another drink would be grand.
                         
           She EXITS.
                         
           Cal feels bad for that one. As she re-approaches: 
                         
                          CAL
           That was uncalled for. Sorry for
           being a dick.

           Tracy, Molly, and Hannah sit in the front row. Jessica

           AN EMPTY SEAT between Tracy and Hannah. He leans 
           forward, are they saving it for him? But just then... 
           Jacob arrives. Kisses Hannah and takes "Cal's" seat. 
           Cal looks nauseous.

           (a bit monotone) 
           Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. 
           Welcome, Class of 2011. 
                          (A BEAT) 
           I wasn't really sure what I wanted 
           to talk about today. Mrs. 
           Thompson said it might be good to 
           talk about growing up and getting 
           older and stuff. So I guess I'll 
           talk about that. 
                         
           Cal watches, concerned. Where's his son? 
                         
                          ROBBIE 
           I grew up a lot this year, I 
           think. I used to think that 
           growing up meant really growing. 
           Like getting taller and bigger. 
           But now I think that growing up 
           just makes you smaller. Your 
           dreams get smaller, and what you 
           want gets smaller... 
           (beat, then) 
           I grew an inch and a half this 
           year, but I feel a lot smaller. 
                         
           Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned.

           makes parents laugh because I'm 
           only thirteen but whatever, I was.

           I believed that there was one true 
           love for everyone, and if you 
           fought for that person, your one 
           true love would always work out. 
           But that's not how it works. It 
           sounded good when I was younger, 
           but... it's just not how it works.

           crowd. Everyone turns to look at him.

           Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps 
           over people, squeezes by people, almost trips. 
                         
           Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his 
           dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family.

           Things are just so messed up. And 
           it's been such a strange year. 
           I've been in such a strange place. 
           And we have all these problems, so 
           many problems I've lost count, but 
           at the end of the day, I mean, the 
           only thing I know -- 
                         
           She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply: 
                         
                          TRACY 
           I am just so glad you took me for 
           that ice cream. 
                         
           Cal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then:

THE DARKNESS

Wind comes shreiking across the ice shelf to where THOUSANDS
OF MALES are huddled, ice crusting on their feathers.

             Tell me what it is about the cold and the

The huddled penguins are engaged in ritual chanting

The adult males are packed shoulder to shoulder, looking
downwards at the eggs balanced on their feet.

             Caruso's the leader because he's so
             incredibly old. Some say more than 40,
             but you know how penguins exaggerate.

OUTSIDE

WINDWARD PENGUINS peel off and walk around to the leeward
side. WISHFUL is among them

                       CARUSO
             ....Each one taking his turn to defy the

their breath forming a shared `thought bubble'...a benevolent
ÜBERPENGUIN.

                       CARUSO.
             ...As we invoke the Great One, Penguin of

             My dad was never that devout. Often his

As the chanting builds, a little thought-bubble appears next
to the communal imagination: An image of Norma J

                       WISHFUL
             Oh no! I dropped it! Where's my egg!

WISHFUL barges out of the huddle, retrieves the egg and
waddles back into the warmth again.

We are moving in again, towards the huddle, the voices of the
Great Male Gathering begin to cut through the wind blasts.

Louder and louder, until...

The CHANTING crescendos, awe-inspiring, as it rises above the
sound of the gale, and, as if in response

THE EARTH TURNS!

The CURTAIN OF DARKNESS which overshadows Antarctica begins
to LIFT from the curvature of the southern hemisphere. The
vast ice-continent is BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED once more.

ON THE ICE SHELF

The ICE itself is moaning and groaning, like a living thing.

A SINGLE CRACK appears and widens, then forks and forks
again.

The whole expanse of fast-ice is DISINTEGRATING, starting at
the sea-ice and progressing towards the ice-cliffs.

Somewhere an ICEBERG breaks free from the face of a glacier
and smashes down into the frozen sea below. At the same
time...

THE EMPEROR COMMUNITY

An EGG cracks open, then another, then all in a rush, like
POPCORN.

Fathers are calling out to each other as their fluffy CHICKS
emerge to greet the daylight.

                          EXCITED FATHERS
          ...It's   a   boy!
          ...It's   a   girl!
          ...What   a   peach!
          ...What   a   bruiser!

Amongst the excited crowd of males and hatchlings we find
WISHFUL staring down at his egg still balanced on his feet.

He taps the egg with his beak. Bending close they hear a
TAPPING SOUND in REPLY.

                       FRIENDLY PENGUIN
             Well, how about that?

WISHFUL taps again. The tapping comes back louder. A TINY
FOOT pops out of the egg. Then ANOTHER. The Egg flips and
lurches off in a giddy DANCE.

                       WISHFUL
             Whoa li'l buddy, slow down!

THE FRIENDLY PENGUIN'S chick giggles at the DANCING EGG,
which finally trips and cracks, depositing baby MUMBLE.

             before?
             ...is he damaged?
             ...is he deranged?

They gather round staring down at this strange little jigging
ball of fluff

THE ICE

A LONG LINE of male penguins, thousands of them, all with
their chicks, stand staring expectantly across the ice shelf.

At the front, we find WISHFUL and MUMBLE, who is jiggling
with anticipation, hopping from one foot to the other.

                    MUMBLE
          Is she coming soon?

MIST rises off the ice shelf. The males are still waiting
with their chicks. Over this: The sound of Chicks crying.

MUMBLE between his father's feet, follows his father's
concentrated gaze.

STILL LATER

The baby penguins are HOWLING now.

Anxious fathers lean forward, peering into the distance.

Out of the thickening mist, a cluster of little BLACK DOTS
materialises.

The distant females look exhausted as they totter unsteadily
across the ice towards their partners. The MALES break ranks
and rush towards the distressed females.

             ...Delilah?

                         MALE #3
             ...Gloria?! Gloria??!

WISHFUL, is running frantically through the crowd, singing
all the time in the hope of being recogniosed

                       WISHFUL
             Since my baby left me. I found a new
             place to dwell.
             Down the bottom of lonely street at
             heartbreak hotel

MUMBLE hippity-hops after his father, trying to keep up...

                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)
             Woah I'm so lonely baby. I'm so lonely
             baby. I'm so lonely I could...

Moving beyond the crowd, WISHFUL sees a last few stragglers.
Amongst them...

          Just tired and hungry is all.
          It was dreadful out there....

Over WISHFUL' shoulder, she sees the infant Mumble HIPPITY-
HOPPING towards them.

                    NORMA J
          But who's this.

                    WISHFUL
          I called him Mumble.

Mumbles feet start to tap involuntarily, Then he catches his
dad's warning look.

                    MUMBLE
          Did she get one. Did she bring one back.

                    NORMA J
          Just a little krill that's all

THE GREAT COMMUTE

The ICE-SHELF is as busy as a freeway at peak hour with males
and females are hurrying BACK AND FORTH from the sea.

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             After that, with food being so scarce
             everyone was busy busy busy. Mom and dad
             were working so hard I didn't see much of
             them. Besides I had school to go to.

THE CRECHE

An efficient, caring TEACHER is giving a lesson to a class of
about thirty young chicks grouped in front of her.

                       TEACHER
             Settle class. Settle. We will begin with
             the most important lesson you will ever
             learn. Now does anyone know what that is?

MANY flippers go up.

                        TEACHER (CONT'D)
             Michael?

                       MICK
             Don't eat yellow snow?

                       TEACHER
             True but, that's not it. Mumble?

                       MUMBLE
             Swimming? Catching Food?

                       TEACHER
             Anyone else?

Mumble looks astonished. What's more important than that

                       ELLA
             It's our Heartsong, Miss.

                       TEACHER
             Your Heartsong. Yes. The melody you hear
             inside, the thing that makes you
             different from every other penguin. So.
             Let's all be very still now and listen.
             And when you hear your song, let it come
             out. Who's first.

             Well Michael, if you think that's really

                 (laughs)
             That doesn't make any sense.

                       TEACHER
             Well Mumble...perhaps you can do better

                       MUMBLE
             Mine is more sort of a...

He hesitates, as if listening to something in his head.Then,
he sings UTTERLY TUNELESS, like a drum solo.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Bim bam-a-loolah a bim bam bom

                       TEACHER
             You heard that in there?

Mumble is still going. TITTERS and SNIGGERS from the class.

                       MUMBLE
             You like it?

                       TEACHER
             Dear, that's not even a tune.

                         MUMBLE
             It's not?

                       TEACHER
             No, a tune is like...
                 (she sings a scale)
             La la la la la la la la.

          Oh, La la la la la

A croaky monotone.   The class LAUGHS OPENLY.

                     TEACHER
              (getting worried)
          Listen carefully, Mumble. La la la la la

The class fall about in HYSTERICS.

                    MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D)
          Whats funny?
              (genuinely perplexed)
          What's funny?

LATER

MUMBLE's PARENTS are talking to the TEACHER.

                    TEACHER
              (sotto)
          It's bizarre. I don't understand it. Did
          anything happen - you know...- during early
          development?

                    NORMA J.
          No. All fine. Normal incubation, wasn't
          it honey?

Wishful shuffles guiltily.

                       WISHFUL
          Well Yeah, it was a kinda...a tough winter
          I guess, and he did hatch a little late,
          but...
                 (at a loss.)
          Is there really nothing we can do?

                       TEACHER
             Of course there is. Thats why we have
             Mrs Astrakhan.

MRS ASTRAKHAN'S

Some distance from the creche, MUMBLE stands with MRS
ASTRAKHAN, a Russian-accented remedial teacher.

                       MRS ASTRKHAN
             CAN'T SINK? Rubbeesh. Every little
             pengvin has a sonk. Vhen I have
             feenished, your singink vill be givink
             everyone the goosepeempel.

CU on MUMBLE looking up.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             So. Closink the eyes. Liftink chin. Deep
             breathe here in the downbelow. Now...most
             important part, find a feelink. Happy
             feelink, sad feelink, maybe lonely
             feelink.

MUMBLE closes his eyes.

                            MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             So?...So?...

                       MUMBLE
             I'm thinking.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             Don't think EET!! Feel eet!
             Through the whole body, from the beak
             right down to tippy-toes.

Her voice is seductive, hypnotic.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             And then slowly, very slowly...

She hears a strange TAPPING sound and looks down.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             Vhat? Vhat is this?

                            MUMBLE
             What?

             Rigid like plank, like board. NO
             MOVINK!!!
             Now...calm. Remember the feelink.

                         MUMBLE
             Feelink...ok.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             And be spontanuous.

Once again his feet start twitching uncontrollably.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             No! Stop! No jiggy-jog!

                       MUMBLE
             I'm being spontanuous.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             Not with the feet, with the sonk!
             You vant to meet beautiful girl?
             You vant to make the Egg?

                        MUMBLE
             Oh yes.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             Well singk! "Ba Ba Bleckship,

                       MUMBLE
                 (totally unmusical)
             "Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I..."

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             Hokay. Enough. Stop. Hokay! Ve go back to
             the top. Forget the body, look inside the
             soul. No notes, no sonk, only feelink.
             Happy feelink. Sad feelink. Enormous
             feelink, so enormous it fills the whole
             body. It must escape or you explode! Now,
             open your leetle beak...

Mumble opens his beak, inspired.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             Yes, yes, lift up the head! That's it!

Mumble inhales, his eyes are shining, his body is shaking.

                    MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
          You take a big breath, good and...now! Now!

He's off again, DANCING LIKE A FOOL...wild, exuberant, totally
uninhibited and unselfconscious.

After some time, he remembers himself, stops and turns to the
Mrs Astrakhan who is BANGING HER HEAD against a lump of ice.

                    MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
          Disaster! Catastroff! I never fail!
          Never!

THE ICE SHELF

Follow Mumble as he wanders alone, back towards his class.

He stops some distance away, listening to the other kids who
are now performing with increasing virtuosity.

Ella is among them, her clear high voice borne to him on the
wind.

Mumble sighs and his little shoulders sink, no way he'll ever
be able to sing like that.

                    MUMBLE
          Its tough when you realise you'll never
          fit in. Plus I was beginning to moult

A piece of downy fluff is peeling off one wing

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          I couldn't face the class in this mood So
          I just kept going.

Music over: Walk on By as he wanders through the vast colony
head down against the wind, little feet padding over the ice,

Gradually the colony begins to thin.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Looking for what? I don't know? A
          different type of penguin?

The noise of the colony has faded behind him. He stops and
looks up.

             And that's exactly what I found.




THE EDGE


Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with
broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins
here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird.

A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to
himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around
himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings
angrily..."There's no business like show business.

CU on Mumble. As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony
and then back out over the wasteland

                       MUMBLE
             Not the nicest place in the world but at
             least you could do what you liked here.

Fade in Music: (I'm Free by the Who) and Mumble is off,
skittering over the rubbish strewn ice, little feet dancing
to his hearts content until....

a shadow passes over him and

Whump! a huge SKUA BIRD, twice Mumbles size, with a cruel
flesh-eating beak, lands on the ice right on front of him.

                       SKUA
             Hey, whacha doin' dere flipperbird?

                       MUMBLE
             Me? Oh, nothing. What are you doing?

THREE MORE SKUAS descend. MUMBLE is surrounded.

                       SKUA#1
             Oh we just dropped in for a spota lunch.
             Hey hey hey...

                         MUMBLE

                 (to others)
             Leg or wing?

Their dark eyes fix on Mumble. He is starting to feel uneasy
and backs away.

                       MUMBLE
             But ...but. I'm a penguin.

                        SKUA#1
             Exackly! De flipperbirds - dat's you -
             eat de fish. De flyinbirds - dat's me -

             Right now D'ain't no fish -- so...you do the
             math.

The FIRST SKUA moves in on MUMBLE.

                       FIRST SKUA
             And dis time I'm getting the juicy bits.

                       MUMBLE
             I don't have juicy bits! Look...
             all bone and feather! Feel for yourself.

They fall over each other, fighting to take up Mumble's
invitation.

                       SKUAS
             ...Hey, break me off a piec'a dat!

The Skuas stop momentarily.

             Every seen anything like this?

He does a wild little TAPDANCE hoping to distract them.

He knocks Mumble down and places his HUGE CLAW on his chest.

                    FIRST SKUA (CONT'D)
          Ok boys, for once we gonna do dis
          civilised. Now...

The FIRST SKUA opens his beak to strike. Mumble has noticed a
YELLOW PLASTIC BAND around the Skua's leg.

                    MUMBLE
          Hey! What's that on your leg?

The FIRST SKUA halts his attack.

                    FIRST SKUA
          Interesting you should ask?

                    OTHER SKUAS
          No! No! Don't startim on that!

He turns and whacks the other SKUAS over the head with his
wing.

                    FIRST SKUA
          Shaddap! The flipperbird aksed me a
          question.

               bloodshot eye.)

MUMBLE takes a few steps back, looking for an escape.The
FIRST SKUA towering over him...

Mumble keeps backing off, feigning interest...

          Unbelievable.

          At least those aliens didn't eat you.

                    FIRST SKUA
          True. I guess my cries for mercy appealed
          to their better nature.

                    MUMBLE
          So - You think I could appeal to your
          better nature?

He opens his beak wide as MUMBLE stumbles backwards and falls
into a narrow CREVICE in the ice.

                       FIRST SKUA (CONT'D)
             Hey! Whatcha think ya doin' down dere
             flipperbird? Get back up here dis minute!

The other Skuas move in to help. MUMBLE cowers in the CRACK
as they spear at him with their beaks.

                         SKUAS
             ...Come on, out witcha!
             ...Ya sneaky-ass flipperbird!

They can't get hold of him. Frustrated, they turn on the
FIRST SKUA, squabbling and whacking each other with their
wings.

                         SKUAS (CONT'D)

             when I peck you know you've been
             pecked...(fade)

MUMBLE watches from the safety of the crack as they fight and
argue viciously among themselves

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             Compared with that, school almost seemed
             like fun

THE CRECHE

MUMBLE stands some distance back from where the other young
penguins are taking school lessons.

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             Most days I hid at the back, dreaming
             about the world beyond

MUMBLE looks up at a cloud that resolves itself into the
unmistakable shape of a FISH. As he watches, the cloud morphs
into something that resembles a WHALE. Then morphs again
into...a SEAL. Then into the shape of an upright CREATURE with
bulging eyes and tentacled hands.

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             But right up to graduation I never did
             find my heartsong


LATER. THE GRADUATION CEREMONY

Dozens of MATURE ADOLESCENTS...their coats almost fully moulted
to reveal the sleek, shiny black and white feathers
underneath.

They stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead
penguin, Caruso, walks up and everyone falls silent

                       CARUSO
             Graduates, today you leave the safety of
             our community for the first time,
             forsaking the trusted solid ice for the
             terrible magic of the deep.

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             Caruso. He couldn't help himself.

                       CARUSO.
             Things are not as they were. For five
             years now we have known nothing but
             famine. But you are our hope. Upon your
             survival depends the very future of the
             entire Penguin Nation. Dive deep, swim
             far. May the Great Penguinus go with you.
             And remember...

With solemn gravity, CARUSO throws his flippers into the air
and shouts.

                       CARUSO
             Excelsi-yah! Yah yah yah!

AWAY FROM THE CRECHE

Follow Mumble as he returns to his parents. In his adult
plumage he's distinguishable by a small birthmark, like a
bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head
which has not yet moulted off.

Music Over: Schools Out by Alice Cooper

                    MUMBLE

NORMA J. puts a protective flipper around her son.

          Dad? I'll learn to sing later. I'll find
          my voice out there. In the deep. Truly.

Glancing round he sees the class moves off en masse across
the ice...heading for the sea.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Dad. Pul-eeeze.

Wishful leans forwards, pulls off Mumbles tuft with his beak.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Yeooow!!

He races off, Norma J calling after him:

              (calling after)
          Remember `Stranger Danger'! Never talk to

Mumble turns to wave, falls over, gets up and races on after
the others with his strange hippity-hop little gait.

THE HIGHWAY TO THE SEA

A high shot reveals the miles of frozen ice that the
GRADUATES have to cover to get to the sea.

Some are shuffling along on their feet; others are
tobogganing.

A long way behind them we see the lone figure of MUMBLE
racing to catch up.

AT THE EDGE OF THE ICE

The juvenile penguins stand in a bunch, peering down looking
for somewhere to dive in.

                         GRADUATE PENGUINS
             ...What do you think, here?
             ...Are you kidding?
             ...How about over here then?

They shuffle off in a group to a nearby spot.

                         GRADUATE
             ...That last place looked better.

                        OTHERS
             ..I agree.
             ..Much better.

They all shuffle back to the previous spot and stand there,
frozen by indecision

                       GRADUATE
             ...then again....

Suddenly the little dark figure of MUMBLE barrels through the
pack, yelling

                       MUMBLE
             Outta my way flipperbirds! Coming
             through!!

For a long moment he's airborne.

Then...he hits the water with a strangled squawk!...and
disappears.

                         GRADUATES
             ...What was that?

                        ELLA
             Mumble?

They tentatively crane over the edge. No sign of him. They
peer into the water.

                       GRADUATE
             ...Lunatic!
             ...where did he go?
             ...See any blood?

Then...MUMBLE shoots out of the water like a missile...

                         MUMBLE
             Whatcha waiting for? It's
             fantast...(splosh)

... as he falls back under water again.

                       ELLA
              Go Mumble!

Without hesitation ELLA follows him.

The others follow ELLA. A few at first, then all of them en
masse leap yelling and hollering.

SURFACE/ UNDERWATER

The penguins flounder around, flapping, laughing, and choking

                       MUMBLE
             I had an instinct I'd be good at this.
             Actually we all were. We were the best.
                                                             27.


UNDERWATER

Transformed into creatures of grace and exuberance, they
swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles.

Over this: the music of THE BEACH BOYS.

                        BEACH BOYS
             "Suntanned bodies and the waves of

             coastline.
             In the warmed up weather, let's get
             together and do it again..."

Two PENGUINS shoot up through HOLES IN THE ICE...

THE SURFACE

Skidding out of control, they COLLIDE, ending up in a
breathless heap on top of each other.

                         ELLA
             Mumble?

                         MUMBLE
             Ella?

They scramble to their feet...but the ice is slippery.They
clutch together, slipping and sliding.

                         ELLA
             Woah!

                       MUMBLE
             I've got you! No I don't.

Leaning against each other, they manage to stand up, close
now, eyes meeting.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Yes I do.

A brief moment then.

                         MALE PENGUIN

             ...Ella!
             ...Where da get to?
             ...there you are!

Laughing, she dives into the water. The young males follow
her. MUMBLE hippity-hops to the edge and tumbles in after
her.

UNDERWATER

A half dozen of them gambolling together, their bubble trails
intertwining...

                       BEACH BOYS
             "In the warmed up weather, let's get

Then everyone freezes as a few silvery FISH swim past.

                         MUMBLE
             ...FISH!!

They all zero in.

Collisions, barging, a bit like water polo when the ball is
first thrown in. In an instant...all the fish are taken.

ON THE SURFACE

MUMBLE surfaces with a fish in his beak

Suddenly, A SKUA BIRD swoops down and grabs it.

                       ELLA
             Hey! That's a felony! Mumble, let go!

Mumble hangs on. Neither he not the Skua will let go. The
SKUA soars higher, taking MUMBLE with him.

                       ELLA (CONT'D)
                 (yells)
             Mumble!

MUMBLE is carried...higher and higher. The SKUA tries hard to
shake him off, but finally gives up.

                       SKUA
                 (derisive)
             So fly flipperbird. Fly.

He lets go the fish and MUMBLE plummets downwards, landing
Splat! on an ice floe.

ON THE ICE.

Mumble lies still

Ella and the others gather around. MUMBLE still has the FISH
firmly in his beak.

                       PENGUINS
             ...Is he breathing?
             ...he's certainly not eating

Leaning forward to take the fish

ELLA leans forward, takes the fish, and daintily gulps it
down.

ON AN ICEBERG. NIGHT

The entire sky is ablaze with the shimmering LIGHTS of the
AURORA AUSTRALIS.

The PENGUINS stand below, looking up in wonder. They sing:

                       ELLA AND THE OTHERS
             "Gotta keep those lovin' good Vibrations
             a happenin' with her, "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh..."

The HARMONIES are exquisite until...

             ...Knock it off.

The singing RESUMES.

                       ELLA AND THE CHOIR
             "Gotta keep those lovin' good Vibrations
             A happenin' with her."

Another CRESCENDO...

                          ELLA AND THE CHOIR (CONT'D)
             "Ahhh..."

It's too much for MUMBLE.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                         MUMBLE
             "...AaahhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhh..."

This stops the whole thing dead. ELLA pads over to him.

                       ELLA
                 (gently)
             Mumble, the thing is...

                       MUMBLE
             I know. I know

                       ELLA
             ....It's better if you just listen.

She returns to the choir. The singing resumes...a perfect
harmonic MUMBLE can't help himself. He begins to TAP DANCE.

                         ELLA AND THE OTHERS
             MUMBLE!!!

                       MUMBLE
                 (retreating)
                 OK! I'll quit. OK!

AN ICE-FLOE

We find MUMBLE on his own small ice-floe separate from the
others on their iceberg.

As their singing drifts across to him, MUMBLE does an
exquisite little SOFT-SHOE SHUFFLE.

TIME LAPSE

As night slowly pales to a misty dawn and Mumbles lonely
floe drifts off, turning slowly in the current

Music Over: "The tracks of my tears"

MORNING

He is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice.

                       MUMBLE
                 (sleepily)
             Woah. Whose there.

Another nudge.


                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                          32.
CONTINUED:

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             OK. I'm awake now. You got me

He looks around - an unfamiliar landscape of ice - then over
the side, seeing nothing but slowly spreading ripples.

A more VIOLENT NUDGE from behind almost makes him lose his
balance. A DARK SHAPE passes swiftly through the water.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Saw you. Richard? Eddie? Ella....

The dark shape SHOOTS out of the water. Its GAPING JAWS
missing Mumble by an inch.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             ......aaarghH!

As he recoils, slips and tumbles into the WATER.

UNDERWATER/ SURFACE

Choking, thrashing and gulping air, Mumble SCRAMBLES to get
back onto the ice.

                       MUMBLE
             Everybody out!! LEOPARD SEAL!! (glub)

The murderous creature comes at him, jaws open, baring rows
of sharp TEETH and MUMBLE swims for his life.

The LEOPARD SEAL is relentless, barging through smaller
floes, powering around larger ones.

Mumble just CAN'T SHAKE HIM OFF. Desperate, he shoots up into
the air, landing on a THIN PANCAKE OF ICE that cannot support
his weight.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             HEEEELP!!

Mumble scrambles to gain purchase but FALLS BACK INTO THE
WATER. Now he is ...

UNDER THE ICE SHELF

...caught between the SOLID ICE above him and the bottomless
black WATER below.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Mumble POWERS ahead, the ice above growing thicker, the
angled ceiling forcing him down, deeper into the BLACKNESS.

The Leopard Seal opens its mouth. Its GAPING JAWS are about
to engulf Mumble when...

a little SPECK OF LIGHT appears in the ceiling of ice. Mumble
makes a speedy sharp turn, climbing steeply.

He is in a FUNNEL OF ICE...getting narrower and narrower as it
rises to the surface. The Leopard Seal is CLOSING fast.
MUMBLE shoots THROUGH the hole in the ice and into the air...

THE ICE-SHELF

A small group of ADELIE PENGUINS recoil as MUMBLE explodes
out of the hole, closely followed by the LEOPARD SEAL.

WHAM! THUMP! They belly-flop on the ice .

                         THE ADELIES
                   (wincing)
             ...Ouch!
             ...That's gotta hurt!
             ...Who ordered seal?

Mumble is quickly on his feet and out of the Leopard Seal's
reach. The ADELIES TAUNT the bulky creature like matadors

                       THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...Over here
             ...No over here. Too slow!
             ...have to lose some weight pesado

The frustrated Leopard Seal snaps and snarls impotently.

                         MUMBLE
             Yeah go chase someone your own size, ya
             big.......blubberhead.

Taunting it with a cheeky little TAP DANCE. The Adelies love
it.

                       AN ADELIE
             Hey, amigo. Do that again!

                        MUMBLE
             Do what?
                 (defensive)
              I didn't do anything.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                        AN ADELIE
             That thing with The feet.
                 (to the others)
             ¡Hola muchachos!
             (to Mumble)
             Show them!

                          MUMBLE
             Well...I just kind of go ...like this...and
             then this...

Bolder now, he does a few neat steps.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...¡Oye! Ritmo Cubana!
             ...¡Riba Riba! Shake those hips!
             ...Yo penguino, bust a move!

They COPY HIM, improvising little riffs on his dance step.
The LEOPARD SEAL inches up behind them.

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...Then mebbe something like...
             ...No. I got it. Watch me!

An Adelie adds an ACROBATIC variation of his own. The LEOPARD
SEAL is almost upon them.

                       MUMBLE
             Or how about ...

MUMBLE adds a neatly executed slide just as the LEOPARD SEAL
strikes. MUMBLE avoids the lunge and the creature's face
comes down hard on the ice

                         THE ADELIES
                   (to the winded Seal)
             ...Eat my ice, lardface.
             ...Kiss my frozen toosh, rubber butt

They fall about laughing. The Leopard Seal returns to the
water.

                       LEOPARD SEAL
             I know where you live.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Yeah, it's called The Land, tubby.
             ...Flop back anytime!

Laughing hysterically at their own jokes they strut off.
MUMBLE watches them go.

                       ADELIES
             ...Hey, ain't you coming, tallboy?
             ...Or you got something better to do?

MUMBLE looks out at the endless sea of floating ice-pancakes,
all the way to the horizon. Nothing...

He shrugs and hurries off after his new friends.

FURTHER ON

A strange cacophony building as The four ADELIE AMIGOS and
MUMBLE crest the rise, to see...

ADELIE LAND

A vast, boisterous ADELIE PENGUIN COMMUNITY. Thousands of
them, stretching as far as the eye can see. Its very Rio,
very samba, worlds away from the sedate Emperor colony.

                       MUMBLE
             Wow, there are so many of you!

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Hey, this is nothin'.
             ...Used to be twice as many of us.
             ...Yeah, back when you could still catch a
             fish.

                       MUMBLE
             The shortage has affected you too?!

                       AN ADELIE
             ...Who you calling shortish?
             ...All I know is a lot of us
             ain't comin' back.
             ....And Some folks so hungry they eating
             rocks

Sure enough An ADELIE walks by, a PEBBLE in his beak.

                         THE ADELIES
                   (laughing)
             ...Eating rocks!!?
             ...That is major funny.

                       MUMBLE
             Why funny? That's terrible

                         ADELIES
             ...Just kidding the rocks are for nest-
             building
             ...That's how its works here. The one with
             the most rocks gets the chicas.
             ..Chica boom chica boom chica boom boom
             BOOM!

                       MUMBLE
             So why aren't you guys collecting them

                         THE ADELIES
             ..Cos we got personality!.
             ...Without us the chicas got no boom boom.
             ...Without us the fiesta will be a siesta..
             ...Watch and learn tallboy.

One of the Adelies calls to a pair of YOUNG FEMALES he sees
walking by.

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...Hola Conchita!

The Adelies pose, RUFFLING UP THEIR CRESTS into various
styles: the MOHAWK, the FLAT-TOP...

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...See something you like?

...trying to top each other, they add HIPPITY-HOPS they've just
learned from Mumble. The females are intrigued.

                       A FEMALE
             Hey. Cool. Where'd you learn that?

                         THE ADELIES
             ...The big guy.
             ...He from out of town.
             ...He with us.

                       FEMALE
             Do it again.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Sorry Show's over.
                   (To mumble as they walk off)

          ...You see. Some penguins got it, some
          don't And the Amigos, (in unison) WE GOT

They punch and bump each other playfully.

                      MUMBLE
          ....you think I could get some of it?

                     AN ADELIE
          Hombre, you got so much already, you
          dangerous.

He touches Mumble and recoils as if burnt

                    ADELIE
           Yow!

                    MUMBLE
          You really think so?

                      THE ADELIES
          ...You got the biggest personality of any
          of us.
          ...Except for me, maybe.
          ...Put that ego away, Ramon, you gonna hurt
          someone.

THE CONGA LINE

Music over: Carlos Santana's "Oyé Como Va".

                    MUMBLE (V.O.)
          So for a while I forgot about finding a
          song altogether.

The Adelies and Mumble form a conga, weaving in and out of
the nest builders, aiming a kick here and there at their
industrious brethren
                                                          38.


UNDERWATER

                       MUMBLE
             ...We were a team

the Adelies swoop and dive, corralling a FEW SMALL FISH into
a CREVICE.

The fish, darting to and fro are suddenly confronted by
Mumble's OPEN BEAK.

ON THE ICE AGAIN

Mumble shares out the catch

AN ICEBERG

                       MUMBLE
             ...there was so much to do, so much to
             see

Mumble and the adeles come shooting down a long curving
Slippery dip

                       THE ADELIES
             ...¡Arriba!
             ..Addidas amigos!

As they shoot off the slippery-dip and into the sea mumble
whacks his head on the edge of the ice

UNDERWATER

The Adelies shoot back up to the surface. Mumble sinks,
slightly dazed, watching the kalaeidescope patters of the
surface recede.

Music Over: "Ground Control to major Tom"

ON THE SURFACE

                       ADELIES
             ...Where's the tall-boy
             ...I thought he was with you.

They jump back in to look for him
                                                           39.


UNDERWATER

Mumble keeps sinking, down down down into a great cathedral-
like space, lit by eerie shards of underwater light.

                        MUMBLE
             ....stuff down there beyond my wildest
             imagining.

Imbedded in the base of the glacier, the rusting remains of,
An OLD YELLOW EXCAVATOR projecting out of the glacier.

It hangs there, inscrutable, like a great yellow totem.

Mumble, dwarfed by it, contemplates it for a while, then
ventures inside, into the body of the BEAST.

INSIDE THE BULLDOZER

A rusting steering column, a perforated dashboard.

He pecks at the metal, trying to taste it, listening to the
sound it makes.

OUTSIDE THE BULLDOZER

In the shimmering space outside the bulldozer, the ADELIES
congregate.

                        THE ADELIES
             ... You sure he went in there?
             ...Mumble!
             ...Done go near it, looks like it can
             bite

One of them smims closer to the great jaws

                         ADELIES
             Ramos!

Mumble pops his head out from between the jaws

                       MUMBLE
             Oh! There you are

Terrified the Adelies scatter and shoot to the surface like
missiles.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Guys!    I want to speak to you.
                                                         40.


THE ICE SHELF

The Adelies are heading back to their colony as fast as their
little legs will carry then. Mumble Hippity hops after them

                    ADELIES
          ...Forget it
          ...We're not going back there
          ...Never

                    MUMBLE
          But its dead. It can't hurt you

                    ADELIES
          ...Maybe its got a brother still alive.


                    MUMBLE
          But that's what we have to find out.
          Don't you see. Things like that could be
          eating the fish.

The idea is so stunningly original it stops them in their
tracks.

                    ADELIES
          Okay. Okay. Here's the plan: we go and
          ask the revered one.

                     MUMBLE
          The who?

                    THE ADELIES
          ...Reverend Loveday.
          ...The One who Knows
          ...First we gonna need stones though

                    MUMBLE
          Why stones? Wait for me

LOVEDAY'S MOUND

MUMBLE and the ADELIE AMIGOS are bunched together, near the
head of a LONG QUEUE of Adelies each with a stone or in their
beak.

At the head of this queue stands LOVEDAY - guardian of a huge
pile of pebbles. His head pokes through one of the rings a
PLASTIC SIX-PACK CAN HOLDER festooned with seaweed like a
HOLY MANTLE.

A group of Soul singers, mainly female, sway in the
background, singing a soulful song of adoration as the
Penguin ahead of Mumble steps forward.

                       LOVEDAY
             First, the devotion...

The PENGUIN adds his pebble to the pile.

LOVEDAY holds up a flipper for silence and a hush falls over
the gospel choir

                       LOVEDAY (CONT'D)
             A moment...
                 (composing himself)
                 ... and your question?

                       FIRST IN QUEUE
             Señor Loveday, My wife is one of the
             Disappeared ones Tell me is she alive?

Loveday hyperventillates, his eyes roll up in his head

                       LOVEDAY
             The Mystic Beings are speaking to me.
             Yes! She is alive and happy and you are
             in her thoughts...

                       FIRST IN QUEUE
             But is she with another male?

                       LOVEDAY
             One pebble, one question. Next!

The AMIGOS push MUMBLE forward. He is at least a head taller
than the others.

                         LOVEDAY (CONT'D)
             I sense...you are the one with the
             question.

                         ADELIE
             ...How does he do it?
             ...He just one look and he know.

Mumble places the pebble on the pile. A long Pause

                        LOVEDAY
             A little nervous? That's normal. Take
             your time.

In fact Mumble is mesmerised by the luight catching LOVEDAY's
six pack holder. He bends forwards to study it more closely

                    MUMBLE
          I was wondering. Have You ever been
          abducted by Aliens?

                    LOVEDAY
          No time wasters. Next!

                      THE ADELIES
          ...Señor! That's not his question. He's new
          here.
                (prompting Mumble)
          ...The yellow thing
          ...Ask him what's taking the fish?

                    MUMBLE
              (ignoring them)
          ...you see I met a Skua once, with
          something like that on his legs....

                    LOVEDAY
          ...Skua? Leg? What's he talking about?

                    MUMBLE
          ... and he said he was abducted by
          Aliens.

              (starts to wheeze and cough)
          Listen friend, this is my Sacred
          Talisman, bestowed upon me by the Mystic
          Beings...

                    MUMBLE
          Looks like they bestowed it very tight.

          So these Mystic Beings, did you see them?

                    LOVEDAY

          probe you and stick a pointy thing into
          you?

                    LOVEDAY
          Enough! How many questions is that? You
          don't have enough pebbles.


                      ADELIES IN QUEUE
          ...Yeah, one pebble, one question.
          ...We've all got stuff to ask, pal!

                    MUMBLE
          But I haven't had any answers yet!

                    LOVEDAY
          SILENCIO!! The Mystic Beings are
          speaking. They say show some respect
          stranger. Especially to the One who
          Knows.

A hush falls over the gathering.

                    LOVEDAY (CONT'D)
          The reason there are not enough fish is
          simple: There is not enough love in the
          world. Love is the answer!

One cue the gospel choir start singing: All you need is Love

                    LOVEDAY (CONT'D)
              (over this)
          Okay, everybody, turn around to the
          penguin next to you and give them a great
          big hug. Comeon, everybody...hug! This is a
          safe place.

The gathering hug awkwardly. Mumble, because of his towering
height, has trouble embracing the Adelie next to him.

                    LOVEDAY (CONT'D)
          Now. The Mating Season starts today so
          here's what everybody should do: go forth
          and multiply! If you'll excuse I myself
          must retire for a moment to the couch of
          indulgence... okay ladies, who's gonna be

MUMBLE and the ADELIES are jostled aside in the STAMPEDE of
FEMALES as the gospel group break ranks and mob him

                    FEMALE ADELIES
          ..Me Loveday.
          ..Me!

          ...why didn't someone tell us.

A couple of females look up from the scrum

                    FEMALE
          ...How many rocks you got.

                    HER FRIEND

              (getting desperate)
          Wait. Look.

The Adelies all start DANCING MADLY, but it is too frenetic,
too desperate.

          We don't collect them. All we have to do

          ...Easy as that?

Mumble looks at them. Then opens his beak and demonstrates:

THE EMPEROR COLONY

It is autumn, the EMPEROR PENGUINS for the mating season.

It is just like the GREAT GATHERING we saw at the beginning
of our story. Males and females sing their Heartsongs. And
ONE SONG stands out from all the others.

Where NORMA J. once sang, stands ELLA, now sleek and fully
mature. Gathered around her in a semi-circle, a half a dozen
adoring MALES.

                    ELLA
          Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
          Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

Suddenly she becomes aware of a MELLIFLUOUS MALE VOICE
overlapping hers. It has a curious bossa nova rhythm.

                    MUMBLE
          Tall and tanned and young and lovely
          The Girl from Ipanema goes walking
          And when she passes each guy she passes
          goes `Aaaah'

Ella turns to see: a PENGUIN backlit by the sun, standing
HEROICALLY on a little rise, just as WISHFUL did.

Ella recognizes those TAPPING FEET. Could this be MUMBLE?She
moves closer to investigate.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Oh, and I want her so badly
          How can I tell her I love her?
          Yes I would give my heart gladly

             Mumble?

                       SINGING VOICE
             Tall and tanned and young and lovely..

                       MUMBLE
                 (overlapping)
             Hi Ella, what do you think?

Ella, suspicious moves to one side. Mumble moves to block her
view. She moves further tound and sees:

                       THE ADELIE
             ¡Hola bonita!

Obviously he's been singing while Mumble mimes

                       ELLA
             Mumble, that's just cheap

She turns and heads off. The Adelie starts after her.

                         THE ADELIE
             Wait up! You and me baby, we can make
             sweet music. I may be short but I'm a
             love god...Ooww!

Mumble smacks him with the back of a flipper and goes off
after Ella himself.

                       MUMBLE
             Ella. Wait!

She stops. He takes her by the shoulders Shes upset.

                          MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             I'm sorry.

                       ELLA
                 (shakes her head, tearful)
             When you left without saying goodbye I
             thought something had happened, then I
             thought he just doesn't care.

                     MUMBLE
          Don't care? I never stopped thinking
          about you.

                    ELLA
          And then when I saw you singing, for a
          second I thought...

                    MUMBLE
          I can't sing.

                    ELLA
          I know. I know. Its impossible.


She walks off.

                    MUMBLE
          But I'll show you something better

He TAPS an up-tempo, syncopated rhythm on the ice.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Sing something to this!

                    ELLA
              (her back to him)
          What's the point. It's embarrassing

                    MUMBLE
          Just try it. This once.

Ella begins to hum Never Can Say Goodbye ironically and
without conviction.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Okay, that'll work. Just keep it going.

The singing ADELIE joins in...acapella, very rhythmic

                      THE ADELIE
          "...turn around you fool
          You know I love you more and more..."

Right on cue, the rest of the AMIGOS appear on either side of
him, singing back-up.

          "Tell me why is it so
          Don't wanna let you go
          I never can say goodbye, no...no no no..."

Curious, ELLA TURNS.

Framed between the Adelies, Mumble strikes a pose, holds it
for a moment... then lets rip.

He TAP DANCES...UNINHIBITED, WILD, JOYOUS. The ADELIES
accompany him. They know all the moves and it is INFECTIOUS

FEET are beginning to tap, couples are beginning to
improvise... singing along, trying out the dance steps.

Now ELLA is caught up in it. AND MUMBLE IS DANCING LIKE NO
PENGUIN HAS EVER DONE BEFORE!

                    MUMBLE
          This is it Ella! This is the song inside
          me!

ELLA is ecstatic. Just when we think the WHOLE COLONY will be
swept up into the abandon. A DARK FIGURE steps forward

                        CARUSO
              (bellows)
          STOP...THIS...DEPRAVITY!!!

ELLA STOPS DANCING. MUMBLE misses a beat, loses his footing,
trips and goes sliding across the ice to the feet of CARUSO
and the ELDERS.

                    CARUSO (CONT'D)
          WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS
          ABOMINATION?!!

          heretic behaviour that has brought the
          Scarcity upon us! Don't you see...we are

          can't cause a food shortage.

          ...then what did?!

                       MUMBLE
          My own opinion? I think living beyond
          the ice there are creatures we've never
          met before Aliens. Mystic Beings. Big,
          flabby......

                      WISHFUL
            Truth is, I'm the cause of it. I dropped
            the egg. I made you how you are. If only
            you'd come back to us, relinquish the
            dark side

                      MUMBLE
            No. Dad. No. What have they done to you.
            You're talking like Caruso.

                      WISHFUL
            Just do it. Pray to the Forefathers for
            forgiveness.

                      MUMBLE
            No. You're nuts. All of you. I'm outa
            here.

MUMBLE walks away. The community part to let him go. Ella
chases after him.

                      ELLA
            Wait! Mumble!

Catching up with him

                      MUMBLE
            Its no use Ella. I can't live with that.

                      ELLA
            Can you live without it?

He stops.

          I believe in you, Mumble. But without the
          huddle we can't make an egg. Without the
          egg, what are we here for?

                    ADELIES
          ...True
          ...That's a big question

                    MUMBLE
          Guys. Can Me and Ella be alone for a bit

The Adelies give them space

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          OK. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm
          going to talk an alien. I'm going to find
          what's causing the shortage

                    ELLA
          But what about?...

                    MUMBLE
          Its the only way. You're right. Unless
          we have food theres no future for any of
          us - you, me the adelies, anyone

                    ELLA
          But...

                    MUMBLE
          Give me a year, just until the next great
          gathering. If I don't make it back ....at
          least I tried

                    ELLA
          But...

                    MUMBLE
          Now go back. I love you. Go.

ELLAS watches through tears as the tiny figures of Mumble and
the Adelies dwindle to specks and disappear into the mist.

THE ICE SHELF

Mumble and the Adelies have put the colony far behind,
trekking homewards

                       ADELIES
             Tell me again where we're going.

                       MUMBLE
             To find the mystic beings.

                       ADELIES
             How do we know where they live.

                       MUMBLE
             We'll ask Loveday. He's been there.

ADELIELAND

Most of the Adelies are sitting on nests. The Adeleies and
Mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at
them.

                       MOTHER
             ...Not so close. We got babies on board

                       ADELIES

They find LOVEDAY at the back of what is left of his PEBBLE
PILE. He sits leaning against it...exhausted.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...LOVEDAY, you okay??
             ...what happened
             ...Too much boom-boom for one penguin?

MUMBLE kicks a bunch of pebbles at him.

                       MUMBLE
             Just one question! And I want a straight
             answer! Where do I find the Mystic
             Beings?

LOVEDAY tries to raise himself up. A tight low gurgling
rumbles from his throat.

                       AN ADELIE
             Why don't he speak?

LOVEDAY gurgles and points wildly to the SIX-PACK PLASTIC
round his neck.

                         AN ADELIE (CONT'D)
             Talisman...sounds like Talisman!!

LOVEDAY coughs. His eyes bulge.

                         ADELIES
             ...He's possessed!
             ...It's a seizure!

                       MUMBLE
             No. He's choking! The Talisman's gotten
             way too tight.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Why din' you say so?
             ...Hold on we gonna take it off.
             ...You pull that side, I pull this side.

They tug at the SIX-PACK PLASTIC. LOVEDAY GASPS AND WINCES.

                       MUMBLE
             Stop. You're hurting him.

The Adelies back off.

                    AN ADELIE
          Any better?

LOVEDAY gives a little `so-so' gesture with his flipper.

                      THE ADELIES
          ...It not gonna come off.
          ...Of course it's not! It's sacred!

                    MUMBLE
          LOVEDAY, where did you get it?

                      THE ADELIES
          ...It was bestowed on him.
          ...By the Mystic Beings!

LOVEDAY shakes his head sadly.

                    MUMBLE
          They didn't bestow it on you?

                       THE ADELIES
          ...Poor Guy.
          ...He don't know what he's saying.

                    MUMBLE
          If it wasn't bestowed, what happened?

LOVEDAY mimes swimming.

                         THE ADELIES
          ...Oh, this one's easy.
          ...He swam....
          ...On his Hectic Journey of Delightenment...
          ...To the Forbidding Shore.

                    MUMBLE
          And then....?

LOVEDAY mimes the talisman going over his head.

                      AN ADELIE
          ...Well to me that's gotta be bestowing.

LOVEDAY shakes his head, `no'. He stretches his neck.

                    MUMBLE
          You looked up and...... It just got caught
          around your neck?

LOVEDAY hangs his head. A TEAR slides down his beak.

                    MUMBLE
              (gently)
          Loveday, did you ever meet a Mystic
          Being? Really?

Beaten, LOVEDAY shakes his head `No' The Adelies are stunned
into silence.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          But this thing was made by someone. And
          if we find them, they could take it off.

LOVEDAY looks up, a glimmer of hope in his eye.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          So where do we Go, Loveday

Loveday Then he makes a strange "Oi, Oi, Oi" sound.

                    AN ADELIE
          Oh my! Now he thinks he's an Elephant
          Seal

LOVEDAY nods and points towards the mountains.

                    AN ADELIE (CONT'D)
          He wants to go to the top of the
          mountain.

LOVEDAY shakes his head.

                       MUMBLE
          The forbidden place is over the
          mountains...

LOVEDAY nods.

          So who's coming

                     LOVEDAY
          Oi

A MOUNTAIN RIDGE

The Adelies labour uphill into the wind. LOVEDAY is lagging
behind, breathing hard.

Even MUMBLE and the AMIGOS are puffing with the effort of the
climb.

Music Over: He aint heavy he's my brother.

                    ADELIES
          ...Stop. Enough. We must've gone past it
          ...Past? Don't kid me. We're not even
          close.

Then on the wind comes a fiant `Oi, Oi, Oi'.

                    MUMBLE
          Hear that?!

As they crest the peak, sure enough, down below: the LAND of
the ELEPHANT SEALS. Thousands of them.

                        THE ADELIES
          ...Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat
          penguin?
          ...No, no...jus' krill and fish.
          ...Sure of your facts are you?

Not waiting, Mumble launches himself over the other side,
slip-sliding down the mountain. One by one the ADELIES
follow.

                    ADELIES
          Well I guess we're about to find out

THE LAND OF THE ELEPHANT SEALS

The beach is literally heaving.

MUMBLE and the ADELIES come tumbling and sliding right up to
two HUGE SEALS.

             glacier, `n' through the blizzard
             country.

The Good Ole Boys are into ONE-UPMANSHIP.

             Anyhow. Its its forbidden to go there.

                       ELEPHANT SEAL 2
             I heard its forbidden to ask how to get
             there!

He indicates the SIX-PACK PLASTIC around LOVEDAY'S neck.

SEAL 1 lowers it's massive head down to face LOVEDAY.
Wheezing he examines the plastic with first with one eye,
then the other, before announcing his verdict.

                    ELEPHANT SEAL 1
          Could be!? I heard they'd take a whole
          penguin, rip its skin right off and turn
          it into mush.

                    ELEPHANT SEAL 2
          Huh! That's a Picnic! I hear tell they'd
          take a baby seal and club it to death.
          With their bare clubs.

                    ELEPHANT SEAL 1
          Huh! Clubbing's a Clambake! My Granpappy

MUMBLE and LOVEDAY keep trekking.

And reluctantly, he trails after them. As do...

THE BLIZZARD COUNTRY

MUMBLE, LOVEDAY and the ADELIES are tiny specks, struggling
over a series of great ridges.

                    MUMBLE
          So we walked ... and walked .. and kept
          walking. Over the hills and into Blizzard
          country

A SNOW STORM breakes over them. A screaming wind brings total
WHITE-OUT. The Penguins have to shout to make themselves
heard.

                      THE ADELIES

             We need to huddle!

                         THE ADELIES
             Huddle??!

                       MUMBLE
             Form a moving circle! Share the cold,
             share the warmth!

He turns his back to the wind. Immediately the Adelies form a
STRAIGHT LINE down-wind from him.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Oh yeah, nice.
             ...That's definitely better.
             ...Good call big guy.

                       MUMBLE
             I said a circle!

They form a little huddle, but as soon as Mumble moves from
the upwind position, the Adelies complain.

                         AN ADELIE
             ...No, no. This can't be right!
             ...It was better the other way.

They scurry back into a straight line behind Mumble who cops
the FULL BLAST of the GALE.

He gives up and marches off into the driving snow.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Hey!
             ...What happened to the Huddle?!

                        MUMBLE
                  (shouts back)
             Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have
             to!!

The others lie down, propelling themselves forwards on their
fronts

                        THE ADELIES
             ...Oh no, now I got chest pain
             ...tell you, this is a good way to get
             snow blind

          ...just keep moving or you'll get my beak
          up your butt

FLARE OUT TO WHITE

The blizzard has passed. An eerie stillness.

One by one the Adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards
to where Mumble and Loveday stand, gazing into the distance.

They have finally reached the sea again

                    MUMBLE
          You think this is it? The Forbidden
          Shore?

LOVEDAY chokes out a `yes'.

                    ADELIES
          ....The way I feel": the "frostbitten"
          shore
          ....So what are those black things?.

Close to the waters edge, the outline of several buildings

AN ABANDONED WHALING STATION

The PENGUINS venture through it, dwarfed by the old flensing-
sheds, the chimneys and boiling-vats. Its all now abandoned,
and half concealed by snow.

Around and above them, there are HOOKS, CHAINS, rusting
twisted METALWORK.

                    MUMBLE
          Hello?! Is there anyone out there?

An ominous GROANING as some rusting metal plate moves in the
wind.

                     MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Hello!!

                      THE ADELIES
          ...No need to shout.
          ...Yeah, somebody might hear you.
          ...I think we seen all there is to see
          round here.

LOVEDAY is looking at something at his feet.

                       MUMBLE
             What is it?

There, imbedded in the ice: another six pack holder.

THE SEA ICE

Mumble and the Adelies venture out onto the weak ice beyond
the whaling station, finding more and more of the strange
artefacts: a piece of nylon rope, a soda can, a boot.

                       MUMBLE
             They must be here somewhere.
             They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying
             around.

                       AN ADELIE
             Maybe they invisible.

FURTHER ON

They've reached the edge of the sea-ice. LOVEDAY croaks a
warning. He points out to sea.

                       AN ADELIE
             What is that?

A WAVE has appeared on the glassy surface of the sea. It is
coming towards them, FAST like the bow wave of an IMMENSE
UNDERWATER CREATURE.

                        MUMBLE
             A whale?

                       AN ADELIE
             As long as it's a good whale, not the
             other kind.

The wave is coming CLOSER.

                       ANOTHER ADELIE
             What other kind?!!

A massive BLACK DORSAL FIN breaks the surface.

                       MUMBLE
             The ones with teeth!!

The PENGUINS are off and running...

CONTINUED:

The DORSAL FIN keeps coming like the blade of a demonic
carving knife.

Then the monstrous fin disappears and KABOOM! The killer
whale breaches the ice AHEAD of them, cutting off their
retreat.

They are left stranded on a free-floating ICE FLOE

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Jump!
             ...Swim for it!

                       MUMBLE
             No!! Stay on the ice pad where its safe

The little floe is wobbling crazily

                         THE ADELIES
             ...You call this safe amigo?
             ...Maybe we should split up.
             ...You split up I'm staying right here.

The KILLER WHALE breaches again, rising like a tower block
out of the ocean.

                       THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             Woooaaaahhh!!

The ICE PAD flips, flinging them into the water like a
handful of peanuts.

IN THE SEA

The PENGUINS head for shore , swimming for their lives.
LOVEDAY, thrashing and wheezing, is unable to keep up.

                       MUMBLE
                 (stops)
             LOVEDAY! LOVEDAY!!

He swims back. The KILLER WHALE is about to take them both in
one bite. MUMBLE pulls LOVEDAY aside, but he's not quite
quick enough: one of the Whale's outer teeth catches LOVEDAY
by the SIX-PACK PLASTIC and he is DRAGGED AWAY, tethered to
the KILLER WHALE like Captain Ahab.

The WHALE thrashes around wildly trying to dislodge the
hapless little penguin until...


                                                       (CONTINUED)
                                                          65.
CONTINUED:

LOVEDAY is FLUNG high, high into the air and...SPLASHES DOWN
some distance away.

The KILLER WHALE is left with the SIX-PACK PLASTIC lodged in
its teeth.

ICE SHELF

MUMBLE and LOVEDAY scramble onto the ice exhausted.

Wondering where the next attack will come from, the AMIGOS
huddle nearby.

Suddenly the ICE SHELF CRACKS OPEN and the KILLER WHALE soars
right over the top of them

It hits the water but does not stop, just keeps going right
on out to sea. The Penguins have no time to reflect on their
good fortune.

Theres an EARTH SHATTERING NOISE behind them . Turning they
see a vast BLACK SHAPE, a hundred feet high, coming at them
through the fog.

The ADELIES flee across the ice. MUMBLE stands transfixed by
the BIG BLACK SHIP towering above him. On the deck he sees
HUMAN FIGURES...

                        MUMBLE
             Aliens?!

The pack-ice is BUCKLING AND EXPLODING ahead of the GREAT
JUGGERNAUT.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Stop! Please!....

From a safe distance the ADELIES stop and look on in
amazement as Mumble stands his ground, shouting up at THE
SHIP as it advances towards him.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             ...It's very important!

The ICE beneath his feet OPENS UP, Mumble topples into the
gap and The SHIP PASSES OVER HIM, huge propellers churning,
leaving a channel ninety feet wide.

MUMBLE resurfaces.


                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                           66.

                           MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             WE...HAVE...TO...TALK!

He chases after the ship. THE ADELIES chase after Mumble...

                         THE ADELIES
             ...AMIGO-O-O-O! ...LET IT GO-O-O-O-O!!

Already the ship is half a mile away.

THE ICEBERG

Beyond the last of the ice floes is THE WORLD'S TALLEST
ICEBERG. MUMBLE hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling
up its precipitous sides. THE ADELIES follow, struggling to
keep up.

THE SUMMIT

MUMBLE's POV: THE BIG BLACK SHIP has joined TWO OTHERS about
a mile away. The Adelies join him.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...You found them, you found Aliens!
             ...Now we go back tell everybody who's
             taking the fish.


Mumble's     eyes remain fixed on the horizon.


                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...Don't feel bad Tall Guy.
             ...They were just too fast. Too big.
             ...Too everything.

                       MUMBLE
             They've stopped!

                        LOVEDAY
             Mumble. I owe you my life amigo. And I
             say this because I
             admire and deeply respect you. If you are
             thinking what I think
             you are thinking. You are out of your
             crazy head

                       MUMBLE
             Say Hi to Ella for me

             You say Hi. Come back and say Hi to her
             yourself

Mumble turns, takes a few paces back.

                       MUMBLE
             Oh. One other thing. You guys

                       ADELIES
             What?


Suddenly, MUMBLE turns to the precipice and runs as fast as
he can...

                       MUMBLE
             Excelsi yah!!!

As he launches himself into space...

WIDE SHOT

The tiny penguin soaring off the top of the ICEBERG.

THE ADELIES rush to the edge as, far below Mumble HITS THE
WATER. And vanishes.

                       THE ADELIES
             ...can you believe that
             ...brought us all this way and killed
             himself
             ...no he didn't! look!

Far out he has surfaced and is swimming strongly in direction
of the BIG BLACK SHIP.

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...A dive like that, and still he lives!
             ... Yeah like when he did his Happy Feet,
             his feet had wings.
             ...A normal penguin could never have done
             it.

                       LOVEDAY
             You don't think we should go with him

Loveday follows behind

             Maybe just call me Pedro

THE OPEN SEA

MUMBLE PLOUGHS THROUGH a rolling sea: towering waves block
everything from view but on the crests he catches sight of...

THREE BLACK SHIPS, far ahead, but stationary, as if waiting
for him.

LATER

He's getting closer. The ships are only half a mile away when
Something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a
HUGE NET, TEEMING WITH FISH.

Mumble shoots out of the way, just avoiding being caught as.

UP AHEAD The great NET FULL OF FISH breaks the surface of the
water and is winched on board.

                       MUMBLE
                 (yells)
             HEY! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
             WHAT ABOUT US?!
             THE SCARCITY! THE SCARCITY!!

As if in response the ship's ENGINES START UP again and the
sea around him erupts in churning foam.

Swamped by the wake, Mumble goes under. When he resurfaces,
THE SHIP is already on its way.

             THIS?!! NOT IF I CAN HELP IT YOU SHIT-
             SQUIRTER ALIEN CREEPS.

He takes a deep breath and resumes his pursuit.

OPEN OCEAN

The SEAS are MOUNTAINOUS. There is no sign of the ship now,
nor of land.

MUMBLE swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest
and down into the deep dark valley below.

LATER

The air is full of spray. Choking, MUMBLE ducks under the
water.

UNDERWATER

Its peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns
with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!!

A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a
few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening.

                         MUMBLE
             Too loud.

He surfaces, spluttering.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Too loud!

A VOICE calls to him from above. Mumble looks up. An
ALBATROSS hovers overhead.

                       ALBATROSS
             He's looking for a mate, mate. And these
             days, I tell you they're few and far
             between

From the ALBATROSS' aerial view, Mumble looks tiny next to
the MASSIVE BULK of the Blue Whale.

             Convergence mate.

                       MUMBLE
             The Convergence?

                       ALBATROSS
             Where the cold water meets the warm,
             mate. Once you cross it, there's no
             getting' back. What you tryinmg to prove
             anyway?

                       MUMBLE
             I'm trying to talk to the Aliens!

                        ALBATROSS
             The who?

                       MUMBLE
             On the black iceberg. The ones taking all
             the fish!

                       ALBATROSS
             Them. Fish is just the start of it Mate.
             Them aliens is the ones who took out the
             whales.

                       MUMBLE
             They kill whales! That's impossible

                       ALBATROSS
             Straight up mate. Biggest creatures ever
             lived. Decimated, mate.

                        MUMBLE
             So if I wanted to talk to them, where
             would I go

                       ALBATROSS
             Anywhere and everywhere. Over the sea,
             under the sea, Jees, I've even seen them
             fly. The great southland's swarming with
             em

                       MUMBLE
             Where's that. Do you think the Whale
             would take me there?


                                                        (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

The Blue Whale responds with a long mournful "NO-O-O-O" which
the Albatross does not need to translate.

                    ALBATROSS
          No way mate, he won't go anywhere near
          `em. And neither should you.

Mumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the
warnings.

He makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards
the convergence.

The Albatross, hovering on the wing, watches.

                    ALBATROSS (CONT'D)
          Don't say I didn't warn you

The ALBATROSS wheels away.

As MUMBLE fights on through the huge choppy waves, the
Whale's Wagnerian song booms out, EERIE and FORLORN.

THE CONVERGENCE

We see from above, the BLUE WHALE turning as well, changing
course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the
water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see. MUMBLE
swims RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE.

A VAST OCEAN

MUMBLE is a mere DOT now as the GREAT CURRENTS capture him
and sweep him away.

We pull back through the clouds until the very CURVATURE OF
THE EARTH is visible: a blue horizon with no land in sight.

SMALL POLLUTED BEACH

On the HIGH-WATER MARK, amongst the rubbish and the oil
slick, we see what looks like a dead animal. It is MUMBLE.

A creature in RED GUMBOOTS approaches. Its small hand reaches
down and nudges him with a stick. MUMBLE moans and the
gumboots RUN AWAY, shouting something unintelligible.

With great difficulty, Mumble raises his head to try to see

CONSCIOUSNESS.
                                                            72.


A WHITE ROOM

Scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on
shelves line the walls.

MUMBLE, eyes closed, is lying on a stainless steel table. He
opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp.

There is movement around him. Voices whispering in an alien
tongue. A FIGURE IN WHITE bends over him cleaning the oil
from his feathers with detergent. MUMBLE squawks.

                    MUMBLE (VO)
          When I finally saw one, the Alien was
          even more hideous than I'd imagined

A very pretty FEMALE SCIENTIST is smiling down at him.

                      MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D)
          ... frontways eyes, no feathers. Big teeth
          with blood around them. Strange fleshy
          beak. A meat eater

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
              (terrified)
          The - fish - are - ours. Understand?

But all the SCIENTIST sees is a squawking penguin.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          We can't live without them!

The SCIENTIST produces a syringe and squirts some of it's
contents in the air.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Speak Adelie? Skua-talk?

Another SCIENTIST holds him still while the needle is
administered.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Oh no! Not the pointy thing!

Drowsy now, he is eased into a PADDED CAGE. The SCIENTISTS
close the lid, and secure it with straps.

IN THE CARGO HOLD

We hear a feeble thumping from inside.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

Pull back to reveal Mumble's box on a shelf among crates and
luggage. Fade in engine noise over as....

ENDLESS SKY

A 747 drones across the screen, eastwards into the night.

DARKNESS

                       MUMBLE
             I woke in darkness. Unable to move. Was I
             dead? And if I was dead, where was that
             light coming from

Like the light at the end of a tunnel. As if in a dream,
MUMBLE ambles towards it. Emerging into

PENGUIN HEAVEN

Bright BLUE SKY, sparkling WHITE CLIFFS OF ICE.

                       MUMBLE
             Wow. They brought me home

His voice ECHOES back at him, with a mocking edge. There is
something unusual about this place. A plump penguin waddles
by

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Excuse me, where are we.

                       PENGUIN
             Heaven. Where d'you think?

                       MUMBLE
             Oh. So we're dead. Right

                       PENGUIN
             Dunno. Don't care. We got food. We got
             water. You hear a seal now and then, but
             you never meet one. Perfect.

Mumble is looking around, trying to figure it out

                       PENGUIN (CONT'D)
             Fish!

                       MUMBLE
             Where?


                                                        (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

A fish hits him on the head.

A moment later he's knocked flat by a sudden rush of
PENGUINS: Chinstraps, Rock-hoppers, Adelies, King penguins,
emerging from holes in the rock face

                       PENGUINS
             Fish time. Fish time!

Lying on his back he sees fish tumble from the sky. It's
RAINING FISH!

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             Every day after that, it rained fish in
             the afternoon.

His POV, Load after load of fish tumbling out of a clear sky

UNDERWATER

Fish hit the surface and sink

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             Fish on land and fish underwater.

Mumble pursues one of them.

                       MUMBLE
             Sometime you got a live one but there was
             nowhere really to chase it

He swims SLAP BANG into a sheet of thick glass. ALIEN FACES
are pressed against it. Mumble yells and shoots to the
surface.

THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

High up he sees the viewing gallery. A great CROWD of ALIENS
staring and chattering

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             Aliens everywhere, watching you eat,
             watching you sleep

Mumble backs away and knocks into the PAINTED HORIZON. He
puts out a wing to steady himself and notices a metal tag on
it. This place is beginning to upset him.

                       MUMBLE
                 (yells at the aliens)
             What have you done to my wing! This is
             not my home! I want to get out of here!

The other penguins stand around, immobile, chomping fish.

                       OLD TIMER PENGUIN
             Guess he's new here

THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

Caption: A year later

Specators POV: Mumble stands around, like the others,
ignoring the aliens, chomping fish

His POV: Day after day, the view constantly the same, except
for the groupings of spectators high in the viewing Gallery

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             After a while, you learn to stop fighting
             it. Stop protesting, take the knocks.

CU Mumble: A camera flashes. A fish hits him, he doesn't
flinch

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             ...just take what comes and live inside
             your mind

THE SAME/ PASSAGE OF TIME

Another day and another. Night follows day follows night.
Spectators come and go. The penguins stand like statues.

Though bubbles begin to appear above Mumbles head, snapshots
of his past experiences

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             Sometimes I thought about dad and mum.
             Sometimes the Amigos, and others I'd met
             along the way. But mostly I thought about
             Ella, wondering who she ended up with.
             Whether she had enough food to eat.
             whether she still remembered our song.

In the though bubble, Ella has appeared singing never can say
goodbye. Mumbles feet begin shuffling to the rythm
                                                        76.


SPECTATORS GALLERY

Most of the specators are leaving but one young girls stops
and stares

                     YOUNG GIRL
           Look Mommy! It's dancing!

She bangs on the glass in her excitement.

PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

Mumble, woken from his reverie, looks up and sees her looking
at him.

                     MUMBLE
           What? What did I do?

The little girl who is pointing at mumbles feet. Mumble looks
down, realizes what his feet are doing, looks up again.

                     MUMBLE (CONT'D)
           You like that? Well how about this.

He does a more elaborate step. The Mother shouts in
disbelief. Various other specators come back and join her.

Mumbles fellow captives are unimpressed.

                     PENGUIN #1
           Oh-Oh, another one gone troppo

                     PENGUIN #2
           You think its infectious

                     PENGUIN #3
           I sure hope not

They shuffle away

IN THE SPECTATORS GALLERY.

The aliens, in contrast, are loving it. Already a crowd has
gathered, laughing and clapping.

NEXT DAY

The Gallery is packed. Mumble keeps dancing
                                                           77.


NEXT DAY

Theres a riot going on up there. People fighting to get a
view. Newspaper reporters, TV cameras.

The other penguins in the enclosure have moved back, giving
Mumble more space. Every specattor is focussed on him. Mumble
is focussed on the spectators.

                     MUMBLE (VO
           Yes. Yes. At last something was
           happening. I was finally getting through
           to them!

THE TRANSPORTER BOX

A squawking Mumble is thrust inside and the lid slams shut on
him. Kerchunk.

THE EMPEROR COLONY

Silence, then across the vast expanse a TINY FIGURE appears
on the horizon.

                       PENGUIN V/O'S
           ...What's that?
           ...Where?
           ...Coming from the Inland!

A couple of Penguins watch the approaching figure.

                       PENGUINS
           ...Is it a Penguin?
           ...Is it one of ours?

LATER

Mumble approaches the two sentries. The colony is much
diminished: only small groups scattered here and there.

                     MUMBLE
           Hi, where is everybody!?

                     PENGUINS
           Who wants to know?

                      MUMBLE
           I used to live here. When's the Great
           Gathering?


                                                      (CONTINUED)
                                                               78.
CONTINUED:

                       PENGUINS
             This is it. I guess

                       MUMBLE
             This is all that's left?

Other penguins are gathering to scrutinise the stranger.

                         PENGUINS
             ... So Who's this?
             ...Kinda small for an emperor.
             ...(suspicious) Where did you say you were
             from?

Then a female penguin bursts out of the crowd.

                       ELLA
             Mumble?! Its Mumble!!

                       MUMBLE
             Ella! Is it you. You haven't changed a
             bit.

As he speaks, his eyes are drawn to the huge number of FLUFFY
CHICKS following behind her

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Are these all yours?

                       ELLA
             They're my singing students.

                       MUMBLE
             So. You never....

                       ELLA
             Of course not. I was waiting for you.

                       MUMBLE
             But that's fantastic. I've got so much to
             tell you - to tell everyone.
                 (To the gathering crowd)
             I found out who's been causing the
             Scarcity!

                       ELLA
             Huh?

                    MUMBLE
          I know who's been taking our fish!
          I made contact with Aliens!
          They're coming here. Right behind me.
          Listen.

They listen. Above the wind   faint electronic BEEPING SOUND.

                    PENGUINS
          ...Who's doing all the shouting
          ...Its Mumble. He's worse than before.

                    MUMBLE
          No, honestly Aliens will be here soon!
          You have to believe me. We came in a big
          hollow bird and they landed on the ice
          and....

CARUSO bursts through the crowd.

                    CARUSO.
          You again! And still full of the same old
          nonsense.

                    MUMBLE
          But its true!!

The BEEP is quite audible now - a little faster and louder.
Curious, Ella ambles round behind mumble tro see what's
making the noise

                    CARUSO.
          Move along everyone. Pay no attention.
          There's no such thing as aliens

                    ELLA
          So who fixed him up with this.

She turns him around to reveal some kind of circuit board
glued to his back: a small aerial, winking red lights. A
TRANSMITTER.

A gasp of fear and astonishment from the penguins. Caruso is
momentarily speechless.

                    PENGUINS
          ...Does it hurt?
          ....Its not made of feathers thats for
          sure
          ...what's it gonna do

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                    MUMBLE
          It's so they can find me.
              (cocks an ear)
          That's them now. Listen.

A distant rumbling, like some monstrous cataclysm is
approaching

                    CARUSO
          You led them here. Are you crazy!!

                    MUMBLE
          You said they didn't exist.

                    CARUSO
          They'll slaughter us. Head for the sea!

                    MUMBLE
          No. Do this. Do Happy feet.

He starts tap dancing. The penguins are torn, between
Caruso's instructions and Mumbles.

                    MUMBLES
          Its what they understand. They can't
          talk, they can't sing. They speak with
          their feet. Do it.

A few adventurous souls begin to copy him, out of fear if
nothing else.

As they do so, the sky begins to darken. A strange whirling
wind starts whipping the snow around them. The very earth
seems to be shaking under them.

                    CARUSO.
          Now look what you've done!

                    PENGUINS
          ...its the end of the world.
          ....Its all Mumbles fault. I told you

Wishful rounds on them angrily.

                    WISHFUL
          Just do what the kid says.

They start dancing.

Caruso has climbed a small hillock and is ranting like an old

The tide is beginning to turn in his favour

          That's it! Excellent! ¡Riba Riba,
          penguinos!

                     CARUSO.
          Adhere to the wisdoms!! The Ancients will
          protect us

As he shouts his he is blown off his feet by a tremendous
gust of wind

Caruso tumbles head over heels as a massive Chinook
helicopter rises over the hirizon, its massive rotors mashing
the air.

It swoops down over the penguin nation and lands a little
distance away.

Music Over: Wanna Dance with Somebody.

We TRAVEL WITH THE SKIDOOS across the ICE-SHELF to the colony

Scientists POV: As they stop, lower their hoods and gaze in
astonishment. One of them lifts a video cam to record

THOUSANDS OF EMPEROR PENGUIN DANCING WITH PURE, ABANDONED
JOY.

                     MUMBLE (VO)
          From that day on, No one quite knows how
          it happened, but the black icebergs began
          to disappear and the fish became abundant
          once more.

A CONFERENCE ROOM

Suited figures are seated round a large table, watching as
IMAGES of the DANCING PENGUIN COLONY play on a video screen.

Without the music it's less obviously a dance.

             disorder? a nutritional deficiency
             perhaps. We'd certainly back the

             So we all step up policing of the pirate
             factory ships. And we pressure that
             country to stop their so-called
             `experimental' fishing.

                       DELEGATE#3
             Yes, if our government asks your
             government to approach their government
             to call off their fleet...

                       DELEGATE#2
             Better if their government hear it from
             our government via your government...

                       CHAIRMAN
             What the heck. The amount of publicity
             this is generating, they'd have world war
             three if they didn't stop.

THE COLONY

In the confusion of penguins we find MUMBLE, ELLA and their
chick

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             Ella's gave up teaching to look after our
             chick. We take turns looking after her
             and going to get the fish.

As we watch, Ella moves off, joining the great to and fro of
penguins along the highway to the sea.



                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                                84.
CONTINUED:

MUMBLE covers his chick protectively, watrching his wife walk
away.

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             I worry about her, sure. Theres so much
             big stuff out there it can be kind of
             frightening.

We are pulling back now, back from the colony, back from
Antarctica.

                       MUMBLE (V.O)
             But the way I see it. Theres so much out
             there we don't understand...,

SPACE

Still pulling back


             ....the stuff you think is small stuff
             could actually be the big stuff.

Keep pulling back from the world, the solar system,       the
galaxy.

                       MUMBLE (V.0
             Or am I not making sense here?

Further back. Our galaxy is framed in something like a bomb-
sight.


                       VOICE#1
             Is there a problem? I thought this one
             was barren.

IN THE DOME

We`re somewhere otherworldly, inside a clear dome the size of
a stadium, with a view of the heavens. In the centre of this
space, always just out of shot, two illdefined figures are
talking, subtitled:

                       VOICE#2
             More or less. But one of the stars we're
             harvesting supports these things here.

Projected somehow in mid-air A 3-D image of Times square in
winter with tiny people milling around in black coats

                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                        85.
CONTINUED:

                         VOICE#1
             So...?

                       VOICE#2
             Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know
             about before was these things here

An image of the dancing penguins appears.

                       VOICE#2 (CONT'D)
             Just thought you'd want to see them
             before...you know.

The shadowy figure laughs, enjoying the image.

                        VOICE#1
             Hmm.   Charming

                         VOICE#2
             So.    We go ahead. Or...?

                       VOICE#1
             No. Better leave them be. See what
             sector twelves got to offer instead.

The bomb sight moves away from our galaxy to another part of
the universe

With that the two figures head off across the great shadowy
interior.

The projector beam catches them, briefly, throwing up the
giant shadows of these aliens They look very like huge
penguins.

As they walking solemnly out of shot with their hands behind
their backs one of them breaks step to do a little jig.


MR. INCREDIBLE

Is this on?



INTERVIEWER

That's fine.



MR. INCREDIBLE

I can break through walls, I just can't...



INTERVIEWER

That's fine.



MR. INCREDIBLE

I can't get this on.



INTERVIEWER

So, Mr. Incredible...do you have a secret identity?



MR. INCREDIBLE

Every superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a
single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time?



ELASTIGIRL

Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this
at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know
what I mean?



FROZONE

Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret
identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I
said, ''Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or
anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a
super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good.



MR. INCREDIBLE

No matter how many times you save the world, it always
manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ''I just cleaned up this
mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?''



INTERVIEWER

I could get to that point.



MR. INCREDIBLE

''Please?''



INTERVIEWER

Wait, no, don't get up. We're not finished.



MR. INCREDIBLE

Sometimes l think I'd just like the simple life, you know?
Relax a little and raise a family.



ELASTIGIRL

Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game!
I'm right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the
world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so.

BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Yeah, I've got time.



OLD LADY

Mr. lncredible. Um, Mr. Incredible...



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

What is it, ma'am?



OLD LADY

My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.



[cat meows]



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Certainly, ma'am but I suggest you stand clear. There could
be trouble.



OLD LADY

No, no. He's quite tame.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Let go now!



[cat yowls]



POLICE OFFICER 1

Thank you, Mr. lncredible. You've done it again.



POLICE OFFICER 2

Yeah, you're the best.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No, I'm just here to help.

Attention all units. We have a tour bus robbery...

Tour bus robbery. I've still got time. Officers. Ma'am.
Squeaker.

Cool! Ready for take-off!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

What? No. You're that kid from the fan club. [stammering]
Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

My name is lncrediBoy.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Look, I've been nice, I've stood for photos, signed every
scrap of paper you pushed at me but this is...



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

No, you don't have to worry about training me. I know all

Elastigirl.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Mr. lncredible.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No, it's all right. I've got him.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Sure, you've got him. I just took him out for you.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Sure, you took him out. His attention was on me.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

A fact I exploited to do my job.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

My job, you mean.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

A simple thank you will suffice.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Thanks, but I don't need any help.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Whatever happened to ''ladies first''?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Well, whatever happened to equal treatment?



THIEF

Hey, look, the lady got me first.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Well, we could share, you know.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I work alone.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Well, I think you need to be more...flexible.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Are you doing anything later?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I have a previous engagement.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Shouldn't you be getting ready?

He's gonna jump!

Hey, hey! Aren't you curious about how I get around so fast?
See? I have these rocket boots--

Go home, Buddy.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

What?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Now.



VOYAGE

[French] Little oaf.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Can we talk? You always say be true to yourself, but you
never say which part of yourself to be true to. Well, I've finally figured out
who I am. I am your ward... lncrediBoy!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

And now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

This is because I don't have powers, isn't it? Well not
every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. I invented
these. I can fly. Can you fly?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.



VOYAGE

[French] And your outfit is totally ridiculous!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Just give me one chance! I'll show you. I'll go get the

Buddy, don't!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

It'll only take a second, really.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No, stop! There's a bomb!

BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

The injured jumper. You sent paramedics?



POLICE OFFICER

They've already picked him up.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

The blast in that building was caused by Bomb Voyage who I
caught in the act robbing the vault. Now, we might be able to nab him if we set
up a perimeter.



POLICE OFFICER

You mean he got away?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Well, yeah. Skippy here made sure of that.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

lncrediBoy!

You're not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, I'm late.
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

Oh, the mask! You still got the mask.



[cracks neck]



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Showtime.



PRIEST

Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful
wedded wife?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

You're late. When you asked me if I was doing anything
later, I didn't realize you'd actually forgotten. I thought it was playful
banter.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

It was playful banter.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Cutting it kinda close, don't you think?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

You need to be more... flexible.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I love you, but if we're gonna make this work, you've gotta
be more than Mr. lncredible. You know that. Don't you?



PRIEST

...so long as you both shall live?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I do.



PRIEST

I pronounce this couple husband and wife.



[people cheering and whistling]



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

As long as we both shall live. No matter what happens.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Hey, come on. We're superheroes. What could happen?



ANNOUNCER

In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for
saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,
who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit
against the famed superhero in Superior Court.



SANSWEET'S LAWYER

Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. Mr. Sansweet didn't
want to be saved. And the injury received from Mr. Incredible ''actions'', so
quote, causes him daily pain.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Hey, I saved your life!



SANSWEET

You didn't save my life! You ruined my death, that's what
you did!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Listen--



MR. INCREDIBLE'S LAWYER

My client has no further comment at this time.



ANNOUNCER

Five days later, another suit was filed by victims of the
el train accident. Incredible's court losses cost the government millions. And
opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over.



WOMAN

It is time for their secret identity to become their only
identity. Time for them to join us, or go away.



ANNOUNCER

Under tremendous public pressure, and the crushing
financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly
initiated the superhero relocation program. The supers will be granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never
again resume hero work. Where are they now? They are living among us. Average
citizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world
a better place.

MRS. HOGENSON

Denied? You're denying my claim? I don't understand. I have
full coverage.



BOB

I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson, but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17. It states clearly...



MRS. HOGENSON

I can't pay for this.



BOB

[phone rings] Excuse me. [answers phone] Claims, Bob Parr.



HELEN

I'm calling to celebrate a momentous occasion. We're now
officially moved in.



BOB

Yeah, well, that's great, honey. In the last three years
don't count because...



HELEN

Because I finally unpacked the last box. Now, it's
official. Ha, ha, ha. Why do we have so much junk?



BOB

Listen, honey, I've got a client.



HELEN

Say no more. Go save the world one policy at a time, honey.
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids from school. See you tonight.



BOB

Bye, honey. Excuse me. Where were we?



MRS. HOGENSON

[sobbing] I'm on a fixed income, and if you can't help me,
I don't know what I'll do. [blows nose loudly] [sobbing]



BOB

All right, listen closely. I'd like to help you, but I
can't. I'd like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to Norma Wilcox
on...[whispering] Norma Wilcox. W-l-L-C-O-X. On the third floor. But I can't. I
also do not advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form with our legal
department on the second floor. I wouldn't expect someone to get back to you
quickly to resolve the matter. I'd like to help, but there's nothing I can do.



MRS. HOGENSON

Oh, thank you, young man.



BOB

Shhh! [shouting] I'm sorry, ma'am! I know you're upset!
[whispering] Pretend to be upset.



MRS. HOGENSON

[sobbing]



MR. HUPH

Parr! You authorized payment on the Walker policy?!



BOB

Someone broke into their house, Mr. Huph. Their policy
clearly covers--



MR. HUPH

I don't wanna know about their coverage, Bob! Don't tell me
about their coverage. Tell me how you're keeping Insuricare in the black. Tell
me how that's possible, with you writing checks to every Harry Hardluck and
Sally Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

PRINCIPAL

I appreciate you coming down here, Mrs. Parr.



HELEN

What's this about? Has Dash done something wrong?



BERNIE

He's a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front
of the class.



DASH

He says.



BERNIE

Look, I know it's you! He puts thumbtacks on my stool.



HELEN

You saw him do this?



BERNIE

Well...not really. No. Actually, not.



HELEN

Oh, then how do you know it was him?



BERNIE

I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him. See? You
see? You don't see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right there! Right as
I'm sitting down! I don't know how he does it, but there's no tack before he
moves and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? I think not!



PRINCIPAL

Bernie...



BERNIE

Don't ''Bernie'' me. [screaming] This little rat is guilty!



PRINCIPAL

You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the
trouble.



BERNIE

You're letting him go again? He's guilty! You can see it on
his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty!



HELEN

Dash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to
the office. We need to find a better outlet. A more...constructive outlet.



DASH

Maybe I could, if you'd let me go out for sports.



HELEN

Honey, you know why we can't do that.



DASH

I promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny
bit.



HELEN

Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation.



DASH

You always say, ''Do your best.'' But you don't really mean
it. Why can't I do the best that I can do?



HELEN

Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to
fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else.



DASH

Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of.
Our powers made us special.



HELEN

Everyone's special, Dash.



DASH

Which is another way of saying no one is.



BOY

Hey, Rydinger. Where you headed?



GIRL

Hi, Tony.



TONY

Hey.



BOY

Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?

Uh-huh. Yeah.



HELEN

Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes! Bob, could you help the
carnivore cut his meat?



DASH

Ow.



HELEN

Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about
school?



DASH

[nervously] Well, we dissected a frog.



HELEN

Dash got sent to the office again.



BOB

[distracted] Good. Good.



HELEN

No, Bob, that's bad.



BOB

What?



HELEN

Dash got sent to the office again.



BOB

What?! What for?



DASH

Nothing.



HELEN

He put a tack on the teacher's chair...during class.



DASH

Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape.



BOB

They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa!
You must have been booking. How fast did you think were you going?



HELEN

Bob! We are not encouraging this.



BOB

I'm not encouraging, I'm just asking how fast...



HELEN

Honey!



BOB

Great. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table...



HELEN

The car? What happened to the car?



BOB

Here. I'm getting a new plate.



HELEN

So, how about you, Vi? How was school?



VIOLET

Nothing to report.



HELEN

You've hardly touched your food.



VIOLET

I'm not hungry for meatloaf.



HELEN

Well, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta. What are
you hungry for?



DASH

Tony Rydinger.



VIOLET

Shut up!



DASH

Well, you are.



VIOLET

I said, shut up, you little insect!



DASH

Well, she is.



HELEN

Do not shout at the table. Honey!



BOB

Kids! Listen to your mother.



DASH

She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.



VIOLET

That's it!



HELEN

Stop it!



DASH

You're gonna be toast!



HELEN

Stop running in the house. Sit down!



DASH

Ow! Hey, no force fields!



VIOLET

You started it.



HELEN

You sit down! You sit down! Violet!



BOB

''Simon J. Paladino, longtime advocate of superhero rights,

Bob! It's time to engage. Do something! Don't just stand
there! I need you to intervene!



BOB

You want me to intervene? Okay. I'm intervening. I'm
intervening!



HELEN

Violet, let go of your brother!



JACK-JACK

BOB

Get the door.

LUCIUS

Whoa!



LUCIUS

Ha, ha.



DASH

Oh! I like it when it shatters.



BOB

I'll be back later.



HELEN

Hey, where are you two going?



BOB

It's Wednesday.



HELEN

Oh. Bowling night. Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.



LUCIUS

Will do. Good night, Helen. Good night, kids.



HELEN

Don't think you've avoided talking about your trip to the
principal's office, young man. Your father and I are still gonna discuss it.



DASH

I'm not the only kid who's been sent to the office, you
know.



HELEN

Other kids don't have superpowers. Now, it's perfectly
normal...



VIOLET

Normal? What do you know about normal? What does anyone in
this family know about normal?



HELEN

Now, wait a minute, young lady.



VIOLET

We act normal, mom. I wanna be normal! The only normal one
is Jack-Jack, and he's not even toilet trained.



[Jack-Jack laughing]



DASH

Lucky. I meant about being normal.

LUCIUS

He starts monologuing! He starts like this prepared speech
about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, how the
world will soon be his! Yada, yada, yada.



BOB

LUCIUS

Yammering! I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he
won't shut up.



POLICE RADIO

Municiberg, we have a 23-56...



BOB

23-56, what is that? Robbery?



LUCIUS

This is just sad.



BOB

Yeah, robbery. Want to catch a robber?



LUCIUS

No. Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling. Look, what
if we actually did what our wives think we're doing? Just to shake things up.



WOMAN

He's not alone. The fat guy's still with him. They're just
talking.



LUCIUS

What are we doing here, Bob?



BOB

Protecting people.



LUCIUS

Nobody asked us.



BOB

You need an invitation?



LUCIUS

I'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this,

BOB

Yeah. There was something about him in the paper.



LUCIUS

He had trouble adjusting to civilian life, too.



BOB

When's the last time you saw him?



LUCIUS

I don't see anyone from the old days, Bob. Just you. And
we're pushing our luck as it is.



BOB

Oh, come on.



LUCIUS

It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this, we're
gonna get--



POLICE RADIO

We have a report on a fire...



BOB

A fire. We're close! [yelling] Yeah, baby!



LUCIUS

We're gonna get caught.



BOB

Woohoo! Haha!  Fire! Yeah!



LUCIUS

Is that everybody?



BOB

Yeah, that's everyone.



LUCIUS

It better be.



BOB

Can't you put this out?



LUCIUS

I can't lay down a layer thick enough! It's evaporating too
fast!



BOB

Well, what's that mean?



LUCIUS

It means it's hot! And I'm dehydrated, Bob!



BOB

You're out of ice? You can't run out of ice! I thought you
can use water in the air!



LUCIUS

There is no water in this air! What's your excuse, run out
of muscle?



BOB

I just can't go smashing into walls! The building's getting
weaker by the second! It's gonna come down on top of us!



LUCIUS

I wanted to go bowling!



BOB

All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna get hot!



BOB

Yeah.



BOB

[realizes they're in a jewelry store...] Uh-oh.



BOB

[...and unknowingly trips the alarm] Oh, good.



[alarm sounds]



LUCIUS

Oh, now...that ain't right!



LUCIUS/BOB

- We look like bad guys! Incompetent bad guys!

- You can get water out of the air!



POLICE OFFICER

Freeze!



POLICE OFFICER

Freeze!



LUCIUS

I'm thirsty.



POLICE OFFICER

I said freeze!



LUCIUS

I'm just getting a drink.



POLICE OFFICER

Alright. You've had your drink. Now I want you to...



LUCIUS

I know. I know. Freeze.



[police radio chatter]



POLICE RADIO

Shots fired!



OFFICERS

Police officers!



LUCIUS

That was way too close. We are not doing that again.



MAN

[over radio] Verify you want to switch targets? Over.



WOMAN

Trust me. This is the one he's been looking for.

HELEN

I thought you'd be back by 11 .



BOB

I said I'd be back later.



HELEN

I assumed you'd be back later. lf you came back at
all...you'd be ''back later''.



BOB

Well, I'm back, okay?



HELEN

Is this rubble?



BOB

[with mouth full] It was just a little workout. Just to
stay loose.



HELEN

You know how I feel about that, Bob. Darn you! We can't
blow cover again!



BOB

The building was coming down anyway.



HELEN

What?! You knocked down a building?!



BOB

It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down
anyway.



HELEN

Tell me you haven't been listening to the police scanner
again?



BOB

Look, I performed a public service. You act like that's a
bad thing.



HELEN

It is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you
can relive the glory days is a very bad thing.



BOB

Reliving the glory days is better than acting like they
didn't happen!



HELEN

Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is what's
happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I can't believe you don't want to
go to your own son's graduation.



BOB

It's not a graduation. He's moving from the fourth grade to
the fifth grade.



HELEN

It's a ceremony!



BOB

It's psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate
mediocrity but if someone is genuinely exceptional...



HELEN

This is not about you, Bob. This is about Dash.



BOB

You want to do something for Dash? Then let him actually
compete. Let him go out for sports!



HELEN

I will not be made the enemy here! You know why we can't do
that.



BOB

Because he'd be great!



HELEN

This is not about you!



BOB

All right, Dash. I know you're listening. Come on out.



HELEN

Vi? You, too, young lady.



BOB

Come on. Come on out. It's okay, kids. We're just having a
discussion.



VIOLET

Pretty loud discussion.



BOB

Yeah. But that's okay. Because what's important is that
Mommy and I are always a team. We're always united against, uh, the forces of,
uh...



HELEN

Pigheadedness?



BOB

I was gonna say evil or something.



HELEN

We're sorry we woke you. Everything's okay. Go back to bed.
It's late.



DASH

Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.



VIOLET

Good night.



HELEN

In fact, we should all be in bed.

HUPH'S SECRETARY [over the intercom]

Mr. Huph would like to talk to you in his office.



BOB

Now?



HUPH'S SECRETARY [over the intercom]

Now.



MR. HUPH

Sit down, Bob.



MR. HUPH

I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. Ask me why.



BOB

Okay. Why?



MR. HUPH

Why what? Be specific, Bob.



BOB

Why are you unhappy?



MR. HUPH

Your customers make me unhappy.



BOB

What, you've gotten complaints?



MR. HUPH

Complaints I can handle. What I can't handle is your
customers' inexplicable knowledge of lnsuricare's inner workings! They're
experts. Experts, Bob! Exploiting every loophole, dodging every obstacle!
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!



BOB

Did I do something illegal?



MR. HUPH

No.



BOB

Are you saying we shouldn't help our customers?



MR. HUPH

The law requires that I answer no.



BOB

We're supposed to help people.



MR. HUPH

We're supposed to help our people! Starting with our
stockholders, Bob. Who's helping them out, huh? You know, Bob, a company...



BOB

Is like an enormous clock.



MR. HUPH

...is like an enormous clo--yes. Precisely. It only works if
all the little cogs mesh together. Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs
that fit, that cooperate by design. [chuckling] I'm being metaphorical, Bob.
You know what I mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob? Look at me when I'm talking
to you, Parr!



BOB

That man out there, he needs help.



MR. HUPH

Do not change the subject, Bob. We're discussing your
attitude!



BOB

He is getting mugged!



MR. HUPH

Well, let's hope we don't cover him.



BOB

I'll be right back.



MR. HUPH

Stop right now or you're fired! Close the door. Get over
here, now.



MR. HUPH

I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

Uh-oh.

I'm fired, aren't I?

Oh, you think?



BOB

What can I say, Rick?



RICK

Nothing you haven't said before.



BOB

Someone was in trouble.



RICK

Someone's always in trouble.



BOB

I had to do something.



RICK

Yeah. Every time you say those words, it means a month and
a half of trouble for me, Bob. It means hundreds of thousands of taxpayer's
dollars.



BOB

I know.



RICK

We gotta pay to keep the company quiet. We gotta pay
damages, erase memories, relocate your family. Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money, money. We can't keep doing this, Bob! We appreciate what
you did in the old days, but those days are over. From now on, you're on your
own.



RICK

Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you, you know, for old
times' sake.



BOB

No, I can't do that to my family. Everyone just got
settled. I'll make it work. Thanks.



RICK

Take care of yourself.

Well, what are you waiting for?

The company is sending me to, uh, a conference.

They've never sent you to a conference before. This is

__________________________________________SCENE

MIRAGE

The Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot.
lts artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it's confronted
with. And, unfortunately...



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Let me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to
take orders.



MIRAGE

We lost control. And now it's loose in the jungle,
threatening our facility. We've had to evacuate all personnel from the island
for their own safety.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

How am I going in?



MIRAGE

The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000
feet. lts cloaking devices make it difficult to track. Although we're pretty
sure it's on the southern half of the island. One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

You want me to shut it down without completely destroying
it.



MIRAGE
You are Mr. lncredible.



MIRAGE

I've got to warn you, it's a learning robot. Every moment
you spend fighting it only increases its knowledge of how to beat you.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Shut it down. Do it quickly. Don't destroy it.



MIRAGE

And don't die.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Great. Thanks.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Showtime.

MIRAGE

Actually, you look rather dashing.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I take it our host is...



MIRAGE

Oh, I'm sorry. He won't be dining with us. He hopes you'll
understand.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Of course. I do usually make it a point to know who I'm
working for.



MIRAGE

He prefers a certain amount of anonymity. Surely, you of
all people understand that.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I was just wondering, of all the places to settle down, why
live...



MIRAGE

With a volcano? He's attracted to power. So am I. It's a
weakness we share.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Seems a bit unstable.



MIRAGE

I prefer to think of it as misunderstood.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

[chuckling] Aren't we all?

Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth.
Everything at the table was grown right here. How does it compare?

You have an appointment?

I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

E

[shoos the guard away] Get back to work! Go check the
electric fence or something! What is it? Who are you? What do you want?



E

My God, you've gotten fat. Come in. Come, come.



E

Yes, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no
complaints. But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all.



BOB

Weren't you just in the news? Some show in Prayge...
Prague?



E

Milan, darling. Milan. Supermodels. Ha! Nothing super about
them. Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures with poofy lips who think only
about themselves. Feh! I used to design for gods. But perhaps you come with a
challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call.



BOB

E, I just need a patch job.



E

Hmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy. And
you've torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert? Moonlighting
hero work?



BOB

Must have happened a long time ago.



E

I see. This is a hobo suit, darling. You can't be seen in
this. I won't allow it! Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?



BOB

What do you mean? You designed it.



E

I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. You
need a new suit. That much is certain.



BOB

A new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit?



E

You can't! It's impossible! I'm far too busy. So ask me
now, before I again become sane.



BOB

Wait. You want to make me a suit?



E

You push too hard, darling! But I accept. It will be bold.
Dramatic!



BOB

Yeah.



E

Heroic!



BOB

Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy! Oh! He had a great
look! Oh, the cape and the boots...



E

No capes!



BOB

Isn't that my decision?



E

Do you remember Thunderhead? Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.



BOB

Listen, E...



E

November 15th of '58. All was well, another day saved when
his cape snagged on a missile fin.



BOB

Thunderhead was not the brightest bulb...



E

Stratogale! April 23rd, '57. Cape caught in a jet turbine.



BOB

E, you can't generalize about these things.



E

Meta-man, express elevator. Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex. No capes! Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.



BOB

You know I'm retired from hero work.



E

As am l, Robert. Yet, here we are.



BOB

E, I only need a patch job. For sentimental reasons.



E

[sighs] Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

You're the best of the best, E.

Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it? Much better than those
horrible pajamas he used to wear. They are finished. When are you coming to

Look, I'm calling about...

Don't make me beg, darling. I won't do it, you know.

much for Mr. lncredible! Whoa! Whoa! It's finally ready. You know, I went
through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you, but man, it wasn't
good enough! After you trashed the last one, I had to make some major
modifications. Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it. I mean, after
all...I am your biggest fan.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Buddy?



SYNDROME

My name is not Buddy! And it's not lncrediBoy either! That
ship has sailed. All I wanted was to help you. I only wanted to help! And what
did you say to me?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.



SYNDROME

It tore me apart. But I learned an important lesson. You
can't count on anyone. Especially your heroes.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I was wrong to treat you that way. I'm sorry.



SYNDROME

See? Now you respect me, because I'm a threat. That's the
way it works. Turns out there's a lot of people, whole countries who want
respect. And they will pay through the nose to get it. How do you think I got
rich? I invented weapons. And now I have a weapon only I can defeat. And when I
unleash it, I'll get--



SYNDROME

E

This project has completely confiscated my life, darling.
Consumed me as only hero work can. My best work, I must admit. Simple, elegant,
yet bold. You will die.



HELEN

E, I just...



E

I did Robert's suit, and it turned out so beautiful, I had to
continue.



HELEN

E, It's great to see you, but I gotta tell you I have no
idea what you're talking about. I just...



E

Yes, words are useless. Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble,
gobble! Too much of it, darling. Too much! That is why I show you my work. That
is why you are here.



E

Edna Mode. And guest.



E

Come. Sit.



E

Cream and sugar?



HELEN

Thanks.



E

I started with the baby.



HELEN

Started?



E

Shh! Darling! Shh! I cut it a little roomy for the free
movement. The fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin, and can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees. Completely bulletproof. And machine
washable, darling. That's a new feature.



HELEN

What on earth do you think the baby will be doing?!



E

Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling. Luck favors the
prepared. I didn't know the baby's powers, so I covered the basics.



HELEN

Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.


E

No? Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.



E

Your boy's suit I designed to withstand enormous friction
without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature.



E

Your daughter's suit was tricky. But I finally created a
sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does.



E

Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring
yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually indestructible...yet it
breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing
device, giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a
button. Well, darling? What do you think?



HELEN

What do I think? Bob is retired! I'm retired! Our family is
underground. You helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back?!



E

Well, I assumed you knew, darling. Why would he keep
secrets from you?



HELEN

He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.



E

Men at Robert's age are often unstable. Prone to weakness.



HELEN

What are you saying?



E

Do you know where he is?



HELEN

Of course.



E

Do you know where he is?

I am referring to last night at 2307 hours while you were
snooping around. You sent out a homing signal.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I didn't know about the homing device.



SYNDROME

And now a government plane is requesting permission to land
here! Who did you contact?!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I didn't send for a plane.



SYNDROME

Play the transmission.



HELEN

India golf niner-niner checking in. VFR on top. Over.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Helen!



SYNDROME

So you do know these people. Well, then, I'll send them a
little greeting.



VIOLET

Ow!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Violet!



VIOLET

It's not my fault! Dash ran away, and I knew I'd get blamed
for it--



DASH

That's not true!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Dash?!



VIOLET/DASH

- ...and I thought he'd try to sneak on the plane so I came
here and you closed the doors before I could find him and then you took off and
[to Dash] it's not my fault!

- You said, ''Something's up with Mom. We have to find out
what!" It was your idea! Your idea! Hundred percent all-yours,
all-the-time idea!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Wait a minute, wait a minute. You left Jack-Jack alone?!



VIOLET/DASH

- Yes, mom, I'm completely stupid...of course we got a
sitter! Do you think I'm totally irresponsible? Thanks a lot!

- No, we got someone, Mom. Someone great. We wouldn't do
that.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

All right! Well, who'd you get?



KARI

You don't have to worry about one single thing, Mrs. Parr.
I've got this baby-sitting thing wired. I've taken courses and learned CPR and
I got excellent marks and certificates...



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Kari.



KARI

I also brought Mozart to play while he sleeps to make him
smarter because leading experts say Mozart makes babies smarter.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Kari...



KARI

And the beauty part is that the babies don't even have to
listen 'cause they're asleep! You know, I wish my parents played Mozart when I
slept because half the time I don't even know what the heck anyone's talking
about.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Kari, I really don't feel comfortable with this. I'll pay
you for your trouble, but I'd really rather call a service.



KARI

Oh, there's really no need, Mrs. Parr. I can totally handle
anything this baby can dish out. [cooing] Can't I, little baby? I can handle
it. Who can handle it?



[beeping]



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

India Golf niner-niner transmitting in the blind guard.
Disengage! Repeat, disengage!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Disengage! Repeat, disengage! Friendlies...



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No! Call off the missiles. I'll do anything!



SYNDROME

Too late! Fifteen years too late.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Friendlies at two-zero miles south-southwest of your position.
Angels 10. Track east. Disengage! [to Violet] Vi! You have to put a force field
around the plane.



VIOLET

But you said we weren't supposed to use our powers.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I know what I said! Listen to what I'm saying now!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Disengage. Repeat, disengage!



DASH

Mom?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Violet!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Mayday, mayday! India Golf niner-niner is buddy-spiked!
Abort! Abort! There are children aboard, say again, there are children aboard!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

[to Violet] Put a field around us now!



VIOLET

I've never done one that big!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Violet, do it now!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Abort, abort, abort!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Abort, abort, abort!



[all screaming]



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Brace yourselves!



VIOLET/DASH

Mom! Mom!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Everybody calm down. Now, I'll tell you what we're not
gonna do. We're not gonna panic, we're not gonna--look out!



DASH/VIOLET

- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this anyway?!

- What are we gonna do?! What are we gonna do?!



DASH

We're dead! We're dead!



VIOLET

It blew up!



DASH

We survived but we're dead!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Stop it! We are not gonna die! Now both of you will get a
grip. Or so help me I will ground you for a month! Understand?



MIRAGE

We have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed.



SYNDROME

Ah, you'll get over it. I seem to recall you prefer to
''work alone''. [evil laughter]



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Release me...now!



SYNDROME

Or what?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I'll crush her.



SYNDROME

That sounds a little dark for you. Well, go ahead.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

It'll be easy. Like breaking a toothpick.



SYNDROME

[laughing] Show me.



SYNDROME

I knew you couldn't do it. Even when you have nothing to
lose. You're weak. And I've outgrown you.



[Bob sobbing]



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Those were short-range missiles. Land-based. That way is
our best bet.



DASH

You want to go toward the people that tried to kill us?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

lf it means land, yes.



VIOLET

Do you expect us to swim there?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I expect you to trust me.

HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

What a trooper. I'm so proud of you.



DASH

Thanks, mom.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I think your father is in trouble.



VIOLET

lf you haven't noticed, mom, we're not doing so hot either.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I'm going to look for him. And that means you're in charge
until I get back, Violet.



DASH

What?!



VIOLET
You heard her.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Put these on. Your identity is your most valuable
possession. Protect it. And if anything goes wrong, use your powers.



VIOLET

But you said never to use...



VIOLET

I know what I said! [sighs] Remember the bad guys on those
shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings? Well, these guys are not like
those guys. They won't exercise restraint because you're children. They will
kill you if they get the chance. Do not give them that chance.



VIOLET

Mom?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Vi, I'm counting on you.



VIOLET

There's something I...



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I'm counting on you. Be strong. Dash, if anything goes wrong,
I want you to run as fast as you can.



DASH

As fast as I can?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

As fast as you can. Stay hidden. Keep each other safe. I'll
be back by morning.



VIOLET

Mom! Mom, what happened on the plane. I'm sorry. [stammering]
I wanted to help. I mean, when you asked me to... I'm sorry.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Shh. It isn't your fault. It wasn't fair for me to suddenly
ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we
can't afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Don't
think. And don't worry. lf the time comes, you'll know what to do. It's in your
blood.



MIRAGE

He's not weak, you know.



SYNDROME

What?



MIRAGE

Valuing life is not weakness.



SYNDROME

Oh, hey. Look, look...if you're talking about what happened
in the containment unit, I had everything under control.



MIRAGE

And disregarding it is not strength.



SYNDROME

I called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all. I knew he
wouldn't have it in him to actually...



MIRAGE

Next time you gamble, bet your own life!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Okay, okay, okay.



[voices on radio]



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

A rocket?



[sighs, gasps]



GUARD

Hey!



[struggling]



DASH

Well, not that this isn't fun, but I'm gonna go look
around.



VIOLET

What do you think is going on here? You think we're on
vacation or something? Mom and Dad's lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse,
[whispering] their marriage.



DASH

Their marriage? So, the bad guys are trying to wreck Mom
and Dad's marriage.



VIOLET

Oh, forget it. You're so immature.



DASH

Okay, I'm gonna go look around.



VIOLET

Mom said to stay hidden.



DASH

I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh!



[voices over radio]



DASH

[echoing] Cool!



DASH

[echoing] Cool!



[over radio] Roger. We are ready for launch.



DASH

Vi, Vi!



VIOLET

What did you do?



[over radio] ETA two-niner. Over. TCI clear. Condition
yellow. Status norm.

[over radio] Not responding to IFF. IRCM reads negative.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Huh? What?

There. That one.

Wait a second...

DASH

What do we do?



VIOLET

Run!



DASH

Where are we going?



VIOLET

Away from here!



[PA] Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Intruder alert.



MIRAGE

There isn't much time.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

[grabs Mirage by the neck] No, there isn't. In fact,
there's no time at all.



MIRAGE

[choking] Please...



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Why are you here? How can you possibly bring me lower? What
more can you take away from me?



MIRAGE

[choking] Family survived the crash. They're here on the
island!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

They're alive?



MIRAGE

[gasping, coughing]



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Helen?



MIRAGE

Hello. You must be Mrs. Incre--



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

She was helping me to escape.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

No. That's what I was doing. Let go of me! Let go, you
lousy, lying, unfaithful creep!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

How could I betray the perfect woman?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Oh, you're referring to me now?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Where are the kids?



MIRAGE

They might've triggered the alert.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

What?!



MIRAGE

Security's been sent into the jungle. You better get going.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Now our kids are in danger?!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

lf you suspected danger, why'd you bring them?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I didn't bring 'em, they stowed away. And I don't think
you're not striking the proper tone here!



GUARD

Think they're supers?



VIOLET

Dash, remember what Mom said.



DASH

What?



GUARD 2

Hey! Stop talking!



GUARD 3

Hold it! Freeze!



VIOLET

Dash, run!



DASH

What?



VIOLET

Run!

Oh yeah!

What the--?! They're supers!



GUARD 2

Get the boy! Show yourself!

Hey!



DASH

Ha, ha!



DASH

I'm alive. Yeah!



[Dash shouting]



DASH

Uh-oh.



[water sloshing]



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I should've told you I was fired, I admit it. But I didn't
want you to worry.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

You didn't want me to worry? And now we're running for our
lives through some godforsaken jungle!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

You keep trying to pick a fight, but I'm still just happy
you're alive.



GUARD

I know you're there, Little Miss Disappear.



GUARD

You can't hide from me.



GUARD

There you are.



DASH

Hey!



DASH

Don't touch my sister!



DASH

How are you doing that?



VIOLET

I don't know!



DASH

Whatever you do, don't stop!



VIOLET

Mom! Dad! Hey!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Kids!



MR. INCREDIBLE/ELASTIGIRL

- You're all right.

- Oh, you're all right!



VIOLET

We were so worried about you.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I thought I'd never see you again.



MR. INCREDIBLE/ELASTIGIRL

I love you.



DASH

Wow.



VIOLET

Whoa.



SYNDROME

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, time out! What have we here?
Matching uniforms? Oh, no! Elastigirl? [laughs] You married Elastigirl? Whoa!
And got busy! It's a whole family of supers! Looks like I've hit the jackpot!
Oh, this is just too good!



__________________________________________SCENE

- [on TV] The ship's unique design suggests...

- [on TV] There were no fatalities...



SYNDROME

Huh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool. Just
like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of
screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day!
I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

You mean you killed off real heroes so that you could
pretend to be one?



SYNDROME

Oh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat you! And I did it
without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. I'll give them heroics.
I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen! And when I'm
old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be
superheroes. Everyone can be super. And when everyone's super...no one will be.
[evil laughter]



[soldiers shouting]



SOLDIER

Fire at will!



- [on TV] It's completely overwhelming the tanks.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I'm sorry. This is my fault. I've been a lousy father.
Blind to what I have. So obsessed with being undervalued that I undervalued all
of you.



DASH

Um..dad?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Shh. Don't interrupt.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

So caught up in the past that I...You are my greatest
adventure. And I almost missed it. I swear, I'm gonna get us out of this safely
if I...



VIOLET

Well, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today
but I think it's time we wind down now.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

We need to get back to the mainland.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in. Straight ahead, I
think.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Where are all the guards?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Go, go!



GUARD

Hey, look. Hey! Every time they run, you take a shot.



GUARD 2

Yeah, okay.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

This is the right hangar, but I don't see any jets.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

A jet's not fast enough.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

What's faster than a jet?



DASH

Hey, how about a rocket?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Great! I can't fly a rocket.



VIOLET

You don't have to. Use the coordinates from the last
launch.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed the password by now. How do
I get into the computer?

Say please.

Are we there yet?

We get there when we get there.

How you doing, honey?

Do I have to answer?!

Here we go, honey!

Ready, Violet? Ready? Now!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

This is gonna be rough!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

The robot's in the financial district. Which exit do I
take?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Traction Avenue.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

That'll take me downtown. I take Seventh, don't I?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Don't take Seventh!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Great, we missed it!

You asked me how to get there and I told you. Exit at

That'll take me downtown!

Not Traction!

Super-duper, Dad!

BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Wait here and stay hidden. I'm going in.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

While what? I watch helplessly from the sidelines? I don't
think so.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I'm asking you to wait with the kids.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

And I'm telling you not a chance. You're my husband. I'm
with you for better or worse.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I have to do this alone.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

What is this to you? Playtime?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

So you can be Mr. lncredible again?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Then what? What is it?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I'm not...



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Not what?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I'm not strong enough.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Strong enough. And this will make you stronger?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Yes. No!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

That's what this is? Some sort of workout?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I can't lose you again!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I can't. Not again. I'm not... strong enough.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

lf we work together, you won't have to be.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I don't know what'll happen.

Hey. We're superheroes. What can happen?

Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!



LUCIUS (FROZONE)

A remote? A remote that controls what? The robot?



DASH

It's coming back!



DASH

That wasn't right.



VIOLET

Give me that!

We can't stop it. The only thing hard enough to penetrate
it is...itself.

VIOLET

It doesn't work!

Hey, did you see that? Eh? That's the way to do it. That's
old school.



OLD MAN 2

Yeah. No school like the old school.

Hey, mom! That was sweet when you snagged that bad guy with

Honey, uh, yeah, I'm trying to listen to messages, honey.



[Kari]

- Mrs. Parr, it's me. Jack-Jack is fine, but weird things
are happening.

- Jack-Jack's still fine, but I'm getting really weirded
out! When are you coming back?



DASH

...aced those guys that tried to kill us! That was the best
vacation ever! I love our family.

- I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr! Put that down! Stop it! You need

HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Bob, listen to this.

has special needs.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

"Special needs"?

Here we are.

Replacement? I didn't call a replacement.

Shh. The baby is sleeping. You took away my future. I'm

good sidekick. Ha ha!

He's getting away, Bob! We have to do something! We have to
do something now!

HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Something's happening. What's happening?!



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

We have to stop him! Throw something!

I can't! I might hit Jack-Jack!

Throw me.

Bob, throw me!

No!

This isn't the end of it! I will get your son, eventually.

all will tremble before me!

A MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR treks across the rugged landscape.
          
                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     Legend tells of a legendary warrior
                     whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff
                     of legend.
          
          The warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and
          wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     He traveled the land in search of
                     worthy foes.

          INT. BAR
          
          The warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his
          bamboo. The door BLASTS open. The MANCHU GANG rushes in and
          surrounds him.
          
                                GANG BOSS
                         (to warrior)
                     I see you like to CHEW!
                         (beat)
                     Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!
          
          The Boss punches the table.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     The warrior said nothing for his
                     mouth was full. Then, he swallowed.
          
          He swallows.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     And then, he spoke.
          
                               WARRIOR
                         (dubbed hero voice)
                     Enough talk. Let's FIGHT!
                     SHASHABOOEY!
          
          WHAM! The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes
          flying.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     He was so deadly in fact that his
                     enemies would go blind from
                     overexposure to pure awesomeness.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          The gang members blindly flail about.

                    HE'S TOO AWESOME!
          
          ONLOOKERS swoon.
          
                              SMITTEN BUNNY
                    And ATTRACTIVE!
          
                              GRATEFUL BUNNY
                    How can we repay you??
          
                              WARRIOR
                    There is no charge for awesomeness,
                    or attractiveness.
          
          ONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The entire bar swells, packed to the rafters with ninjas.
          
                                WARRIOR
                    KABLOOEY!
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The roof EXPLODES and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky.
          Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    It mattered not how many foes he
                    faced. They were no match for his
                    bodacity.
          
          The warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final
          blow while doing a split between two trees.
          
          The warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god-
          rays shine down upon him.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Never before had a panda been so
                    feared... and so loved.

                                NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                      Even the most heroic heroes in all
                      of China, the Furious Five, bowed
                      in respect to this great master.
          
                                MONKEY
                      We should hang out.
          
                                 WARRIOR
                      Agreed.
          
          As the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits
          approaching. The Five strike an attack pose. The warrior
          brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain
          into the sea of bandits.
          
                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
                      But hanging out would have to wait.
                      `Cause when you're facing the ten
                      thousand demons of Demon Mountain,
                      there's only one thing that
                      matters. And that's--
          
          In mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.
          
                                MONKEY
                      Po! Get up!
          
                                TIGRESS
                      You'll be late for work!
          
                                 PO
                      Whu?
          
          
          INT. PO'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Po lands hard on the floor. He tries to clear his head and
          wake up.
          
                                PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                      Po! Get up!
          
          We see his room is filled with various kung fu posters
          (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs,
          and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green
          sword).
          
          Po SIGHS.
          
          He attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly
          is too worthy a foe.
          
                                PO'S DAD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      Po! What are you doing up there?
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
                              PO
                    Uh, nothing!
          
          Po hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper!
                    Tigress! Rowrrrr...
          
          OUTSIDE on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig
          watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and
          then quickly ducks out of sight.
          
                              PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                    Po! Let's go! You're late for work!
          
                               PO
                    Coming!
          
          He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the
          wall. It bounces off.
          
          He throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He picks
          it up and heads downstairs. He trips and falls the rest of
          the way.
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. A panda-
          shaped shadow looms over Po.
          
                              PO
                    Sorry, Dad.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
          
          Reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being
          carried by a small DUCK. This is PO'S DAD. Po gets to work,
          which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a
          panda his size.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    What were you doing up there? All
                    that noise.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy
                    dream.
          
          He gets back to work.
          
                                                                      5.

                    About what?
          
                               PO
                    Huh?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    The dream. What were you dreaming
                    about?
          
                              PO
                    What was I... eh, I was dreaming
                    about uh... heh...
          
          Push in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream? He hides his
          throwing star behind his back.
          
                               PO (CONT'D)
                    Noodles.
          
          THOK. Dad stops chopping vegetables.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Noodles. You were really dreaming
                    about noodles?
          
                              PO
                    Uh, yeah. What else would I be
                    dreaming about?
          
          Po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his
          throwing star is sitting in it.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                        (to customer)

                              PO'S DAD
                    Oh, happy day! My son, finally
                    having the noodle dream!
          
          He throws his arms around Po.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    You don't know how long I have been
                    waiting for this moment.
          
          When Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle
          apron.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    This is a sign, Po!

          Po looks at the apron nervously -- what has he gotten himself
          into?
          
                              PO
                    Uh...a sign of what?

                    entrusted with the secret
                    ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient
                    Soup." And then you will fulfill
                    your destiny and take over the
                    restaurant, just as I took it over
                    from my father, who took it over
                    from his father, who won it from a
                    friend in a game of mahjong.

                    No, it was the dream. We are noodle
                    folk. Broth runs through our veins.

                    Oh, because it was a stupid dream.
                    Can you imagine, me making tofu?
                        (laughs at the thought)

          He loads Po's arms with bowls of soup.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Service with a smile!
          
          A GONG sounds in the distance. Po looks out the window at the
          distant JADE PALACE.
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - DAY
          
          SLAM ZOOM in towards Palace.
          
          End next to palace on an old red panda (SHIFU) playing a
          FLUTE. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle
          between the Palace buildings.
          
          Wider: We dolly around from behind the bushes. Stealthy dark
          shapes move in the foreground.
          
          Back on Shifu, still playing. He seems oblivious.
          
          Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously,
          diving on Shifu.
          
          Shifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a
          staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers
          go flying -
          
          They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who
          is now standing - poised - ready for their next move.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Well done, students... if you were
                    trying to disappoint me.
          
          He uses his flute to correct the Five's technique.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Tigress, you need more ferocity.
                    Monkey, greater speed.
          
          Each of the Five bows respectfully as their name is
          mentioned.
          
                                                                      8.
          
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Crane - height. Viper - subtlety.
                    Mantis--
          
          Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared PALACE GOOSE.
          
                              ZENG
                    Master Shifu!
          
                              SHIFU
                        (impatiently)
                    What?!
          
                              ZENG
                        (startled)
                    Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
                    to see you.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY
          
          Shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined
          with palace geese.
          
          
          INT. SCROLL ROOM - DAY
          
          Candles, incense, and smoke fill the room. The door bursts
          open, the candles flicker. Shifu enters.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master Oogway? You summoned me.
          
          He bows. Then looks up without unbowing.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Is something wrong?
          
          Reveal Master Oogway... a wise, old tortoise.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Why must something be wrong for me
                    to want to see my old friend?
          
                              SHIFU
                    So... nothing's wrong?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Well, I didn't say that.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and
          blows out a candle. And another candle. And another.
          
                                                                     9.
          
          
          Finally, Shifu uses his Kung Fu to blow them all out. Oogway
          smiles knowingly.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You were saying?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I have had a vision... Tai Lung
                    will return.
          
          Shifu looks stricken.
          
          
          FLASHBACK - INT. SCROLL ROOM
          
          Quick, impressionistic images of Shifu battling a large,
          shadowy figure (Tai Lung).
          
          
          PRESENT - INT. SCROLL ROOM
          
          Shifu is rattled. He looks at the claw marks that still scar
          the wall and quickly looks away. But he regains his
          composure.
          
                              SHIFU
                    That is impossible. He is in
                    prison.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Nothing is impossible.
          
          Shifu makes a split decision.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Zeng!
          
          He comes flying in. Shifu gets in his face.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
                    to double the guards, double their
                    weapons. Double everything! Tai
                    Lung does not leave that prison!
          
                              ZENG
                    Yes, Master Shifu.
          
          The goose flies off, but... SMACK! He hits a column. Then he
          is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from
          Shifu.
          
                                                                   10.
          
          
                              OOGWAY
                    One often meets his destiny on the
                    road he takes to avoid it.
          
                              SHIFU
                    We have to do something. We can't
                    just let him march on the valley,
                    and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--
          
          Oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Your mind is like this water, my
                    friend. When it is agitated, it
                    becomes difficult to see. But if
                    you allow it to settle, the answer
                    becomes clear.
          
          Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the
          water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved
          dragon clutching a SCROLL in its mouth.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The Dragon Scroll...
          
                              OOGWAY
                    It is time.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But who? Who is worthy to be
                    trusted with the secret to
                    limitless power? To become...the
                    Dragon Warrior?!
          
          Dramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face. Then...
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I don't know.
          
          
          INT. NOODLE SHOP - DAY
          
          Po is serving customers, but has trouble squeezing between
          tables.
          
                              PO
                    Oop...sorry.
          
                              ANGRY PATRON
                    Hey! Watch it, Po!
          
                              PO
                    Sorry. Suck it up.

          He sucks his belly in, but this causes his butt to interfere
          with a bunny family's meal.
          
                              DISGUSTED PATRON
                    Ugh!

                    Oop! Sorry! A thousand pardons.
          
          A couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a
          palace pig hits a tiny gong. This gets Po's attention. He
          rushes up to the poster.

          Other customers are finishing their soup.
          
          One old lady customer slowly counts out coins and puts them
          on the table.

          Throngs of Villagers are streaming into the arena. A couple
          BUNNY KIDS run by.
          
                              BUNNY FAN #1

          Where's Po?
          
          PAN DOWN a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. Po stands
          at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the
          daunting task before him.
          
          Po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs.
          
                                                                   13.
          
          
          The sun beats down on Po, but he presses forward. Climbing.
          Climbing.

          WIDEN TO REVEAL he's only made it up seven steps.

          EXT. JADE PALACE - ARENA PLATFORM
          
          Oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace
          Pig bangs a gong.
          
                              SHIFU
                    It is an historic day, isn't it,
                    Master Oogway?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Yes, and one I feared I would not
                    live to see. Are your students
                    ready?
          
                                                                 14.
          
          
                              SHIFU
                    Yes, Master Oogway.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Now know this, old friend. Whomever
                    I choose will not only bring peace
                    to the Valley, but also to you.
          
          As Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts
          walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards
          the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong.
          
                              ANNOUNCER

          EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - DAY
          
          Throngs of Villagers are streaming into the arena.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF STAIRS - DAY
          
          Po gasps for air as he hoists himself over the last step,
          laughing victoriously.

          The doors to the palace arena begin to close.

                    Oh no! No no no! Wait! I'm coming!
          
          Po runs to the entrance and proceeds to bang on the door.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Hey! Open the door!
          
          DRUMS inside drown out Po's pounding. He yells.
          
                                 PO (CONT'D)
                    Let me in!
          
          Inside, spectators' screams drown out Po's yelling.
          
          Po panics for a beat and then finds a window. He jumps and
          weakly struggles to pull himself up.
          
          Po struggles to peek through the window.
          
                                                                  15.

                     Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It
                     is my great honor to present to
                     you... Tigress! Viper! Crane!
                     Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!
          
          The Five jump into the middle of the ring.

                     The Furious Five!
          
          Po manages a brief glimpse of the Five before a gust of wind
          knocks Po to the ground and shuts the window.
          
                               SHIFU
                     Warriors prepare!
          
          Po runs over to a crack in the wall.

                     Ready for battle!
          
          Inside the arena, Po catches a glimpse of Crane as he spreads
          his wings.
          
                               PO
                     Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of
                     Fire!
          
          One of the spectators walks in front of Po, cutting off his
          view.
          
                               PIG FAN
                     Whoa! Look at that.

                     Hey, get out of the way!
          
          Po backs up to get a better look at Crane in the sky and
          accidentally falls down the stairs.
          
          Po climbs back up and drops his head -- he missed it.
          
          MONTAGE:
          
          Po tries karate chopping the door open...to no avail. He
          slumps to the ground.
          
                                                                 16.

                    Ow...
          
          Po attempts a pole vault, but falls on his back. The pole
          whips around and hits him into the arena wall.
          
          Po rigs a catapult, only to get clobbered by it. The crowd
          CHEERS.
          
          Po sits atop the stairs. Alone.

          Po snaps to attention.
          
          Po pulls on a rope tied to a tree.

                    his Blades of Death!
          
          Tigress sets up to deliver her move.
          
          Po launches himself up above the fence, gets a peek at
          Tigress, then falls out of view just as she does her move.
          
          Po lands outside the arena in a fireworks tent.

          Oogway senses something. He raises his hand and the crowd
          hushes.

                    I sense the Dragon Warrior is among
                    us.
          
          Shifu motions for the Five to gather in the center of the
          ring.

          EXT. TOURNAMENT RING - DAY
          
          Po struggles with something, his back turned to us. Reveal he
          has tied a load of fireworks to a chair. He hops on and
          lights the fuse.
          
                              PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                    Po?!
          
          Po's Dad rushes over and tries to blow out the fuse.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)

                    But I don't understand. You finally
                    had the noodle dream.
          
          Po looks uneasy.

          He looks at the fuse... almost all gone... Po holds onto the
          chair for dear life, closes his eyes, and braces himself for
          liftoff.

          Po finally opens his eyes...
          
          He's still on the ground. The fuse was a dud. Po falls face
          first into the dirt. He looks away, embarrassed. Po's Dad
          holds out his apron.
          
                                 PO'S DAD

          Po sighs, starts to reach for the apron, then-- BOOM! The
          rockets ignite, propelling Po into the stadium wall.

                       Oh! Come back!
          
          Po's rocket chair blasts him into the sky amid a shower of
          fireworks.

          Po climbs up and up...until the rockets die out and the chair
          loses power...

          Oogway's arm sweeps down the line of the expectant Five... Po
          falls towards the center of the ring...
          
          The tension builds as the Five wait to see who will be
          picked. Then... SMASH!
          
          Po lands and kicks up a huge dirt cloud, obscuring the ring.

          He is desperately embarrassed.

          The crowd goes wild! They cheer! They scream! Confetti falls!
          A palanquin is carried past Shifu.

          is abruptly lifted up out of shot.
          
          Cut to the Palace Geese straining.
          
          Po is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin. He is
          carried off. Shifu elbows his way urgently through the
          thronging crowd to get to Oogway.

                    Master Oogway, wait! That flabby
                    panda can't possibly be the answer
                    to... our problem. You were about
                    to point at Tigress. That thing
                    fell in front of her. That was just
                    an accident!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    There are no accidents.
          
          Oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off-screen CRASH!
          
          The camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed
          under Po.
          
          Shifu looks at Oogway. Oogway just smiles.
          
          A squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists Po, the palanquin,
          and the Geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the
          Jade Palace. Stunned, Shifu watches them go.
          
          Behind him, the Five approach and bow.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Forgive us, Master. We have failed
                    you.
          
          Shifu spins around.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No. If the panda has not quit by
                    morning, then I will have failed
                    you.
          
          Confetti flutters through the air as the celebration
          continues around them.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
                                                                 21.
          
          
          EXT. PRISON -- NIGHT
          
          A huge prison is carved into the side of a frozen mountain.
          Fifteen stories of iron and rock. No windows. One door --
          locked, bolted and sealed tight. Rhinoceros guards in armor
          patrol the perimeter.
          
          Zeng, the palace goose, flies into frame and a Rhino Sentry
          spots him in the distance. He lands, sliding on the ice and
          crashing into the gate. The rhinos point their spears at him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Wait wait wait! I bring a message
                    from Master Shifu.
          
          CLANG! The doors creak open. The terrified goose peers in.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. PRISON -- A MOMENT LATER
          
                              COMMANDER
                    What?!?!
                        (reading)
                    "Double the guard?! Extra
                    precautions?! Your prison may not
                    be adequate!"
          
          The Goose is quaking in fear. Stern Rhinos surround him,
          staring daggers at him. The Commander snaps the scroll shut.
          
                              COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    You doubt my prison's security?
          
                               ZENG
                    Absolutely not.
                        (then)
                    Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    I'll give you a message for your
                    Master Shifu.
          
          
          ON A BRIDGE
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Escape from Chogun Prison is
                    impossible!
          
          The Goose is awed by the cavernous prison.
          
                                                                   22.
          
          
                                  ZENG
                       Whoa.
          
          The goose looks over the bridge's edge. The prison goes down
          a long ways. The commander hits the goose on the back.
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       Impressive, isn't it?
          
          A feather from the goose drifts down the prison.
          
                                 ZENG
                       Yes, very impressive. It's VERY
                       impressive.
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       One way in, one way out, one
                       thousand guards, and one prisoner.
          
                                 ZENG
                       Yes, except that prisoner is Tai
                       Lung...
          
          
          AT THE ELEVATOR
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       Take us down.
          
          Several guard rhinos winch the goose and the commander down.
          The commander grabs the chain and shakes the elevator, trying
          to scare the goose.
          
                                 ZENG
                       What are you doing?!
          
          The commander just laughs. The elevator finally lands,
          sending an echo throughout the prison.
          
          AT DOORS -
          
          A number of doors unlock, one after the other. Finally, a
          drawbridge is lowered out onto an island.
          
                                  ZENG (CONT'D)
                       Oh my...
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       Behold, Tai Lung.
          
                                 ZENG
                       I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right
                       here.
          
                                                                  23.
          
          
                              COMMANDER
                    It's nothing to worry about. It's
                    perfectly safe.
          
          He shoves the goose out ahead of him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Oof!
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Crossbows! At the ready!
          
                              ZENG
                    Crossbows?!
          
          They approach TAI LUNG, a giant, muscular snow leopard bound
          in a giant piece of tortoise shell armor and chains. He
          barely registers signs of life. The commander walks right up
          to him.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
                    Oogway's finally gonna give someone
                    the Dragon Scroll and it's not
                    gonna be you!
          
          The goose can't believe it.
          
                              ZENG
                    What are you doing?! Don't get him
                    mad.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    What's he gonna do about it? I've
                    got him completely immobilized.
          
          The Commander stomps on Tai Lung's tail. We hear a crunch.
          The goose flinches. But Tai Lung does not react.
          
                              COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    Awww. Did I step on the witty
                    kitty's tail? Awww.
          
          Tai Lung doesn't move. His eyes stare coldly straight ahead.
          
                              ZENG
                    I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm
                    gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing
                    to worry about.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    No, he doesn't.
          
                                                                     24.
          
          
                              ZENG
                    Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we
                    please go now?
          
          The Commander starts to walk back to the elevator. The goose
          hurries after him.
          
          The goose's feather flutters into frame. We follow the
          feather as it lands right in front of Tai Lung.
          
          HIS EYES OPEN. Tai Lung grabs the feather with his tail.
          
          
          INT. JADE PALACE - HALLWAY
          
          The palace doors open to reveal Po on the palanquin, hundreds
          of villagers behind him.
          
                              CROWD

          Po is ushered in and the doors close. He is alone. He runs
          back to the closed palace doors.

                    Wrong! You are not the Dragon
                    Warrior. You will never be the
                    Dragon Warrior until you have
                    learned the secret of the Dragon

          The doors open, revealing Po nursing his wounded finger.
          Shifu steps out of the way and Po's face goes into shock. The
          Five are performing death-defying kung fu moves in the
          training hall. Tigress smashes a swinging, spiked ball of
          wood. ANGLE ON AN AWESTRUCK PO, as shards of wood blast into
          his face. Po is intimidated and overwhelmed.

                    He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior
                    fell out of the sky on a ball of
                    fire.

                    When he walks, the very ground
                    shakes!
          
                              TIGRESS
                    One would think that Master Oogway
                    would choose someone who actually
                    knew Kung Fu.
          
                              CRANE
                    Yeah, or could at least touch his
                    toes.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Or even see his toes.
          
          As the others walk off, we reveal Po, who unbeknownst to them
          has been walking behind them this whole time, hearing
          everything.
          
          He attempts to look at his toes but just sees gut. He lifts
          up his stomach, leans forward... leans... leans... and falls
          over.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          He gets up and watches them go inside. He sighs.

                    Okay.
          
          He tip-toes into the hall.
          
          SQUEAK. The floorboards strain beneath him. SQUEAK.

          Po takes a gentle step. CRE-E-E-A-AA--CHUNK! Po's foot goes
          through the floor. Po tries to recover. SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK!
          THUNK! Po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom
          door.
          
          Crane is staring back at him.

                    You are too concerned with what was
                    and what will be. There is a

          Oogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a

          INT. PRISON -- NIGHT
          
          Using the goose's feather to pick the lock, Tai Lung BURSTS
          free from his armor.
          
          An ALARM RINGS OUT!
          
          The Commander runs to the ledge, the Goose right behind him.

                    What's happening?!
          
          The Goose looks over the edge and sees Tai Lung at the bottom
          of the pit.
          
          Tai Lung struggles with his shackles.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Fire Crossbows!
          
          Tai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and
          then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls,
          creating a makeshift staircase.
          
                              ZENG
                    Tai Lung is free! I must warn

          The Commander shuts the Goose up.

          The winch turns and the elevator starts to rise. A rhino
          guard tries to reach it, but just misses.
          
                              RHINO GUARD #1

                              COMMANDER
                    He won't get far.
                        (to guards)
                    Archers!
          
          Leaping across the spears, Tai Lung catches the elevator as
          the volley of arrows flies down past him.
          
          The guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to
          the bottom of the pit.
          
          Tai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and
          catches the guards by surprise. He grabs the chain and jumps
          over the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the
          next tier, disappearing into the shadows.
          
          Tai Lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally
          reaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the
          Rhino army await.
          
                              ZENG
                    We're dead. So very, very dead.
          
          The Commander hushes the Goose.

                        (to Goose)
                    Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!
          
          Archers set off charges on the ceiling. Massive stalactites
          crash down and the bridge begins to crumble. Tai Lung leaps
          across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump
          towards the Commander. But he falls short, claws scraping and
          sparking against the rock wall. The Commander laughs
          maniacally.
          
          On his way down, Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning
          down to the last group of explosives. He leaps across the
          raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern.
          
          Grabbing a hold of the dynamite, Tai Lung falls and slings it
          ahead of him at the guards.

                    Can we run now?

                              COMMANDER
                    Yes.
          
          
          EXT. PRISON
          
          KA-THOOM! The door blasts open and Rhinos go flying
          everywhere.
          
          WHUMP. The Goose hits the ground. The commander's horn
          prosthetic falls in front of him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Nuuu... Urggg...
          
          Tai Lung picks up the Goose by the throat.
          
                              ZENG (CONT'D)
                    URRK!
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was
                    beginning to think I had been
                    forgotten.
          
          With a creepy tenderness, Tai Lung smooths the Goose's
          ruffled feathers.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    Fly back there and tell them...the
                    real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
          
          Tai Lung throws the Goose into the air and he flutters off.
          Lightning strikes.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. BUNKHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Shifu enters the hallway of the bunkhouse. The Five burst out
          of their rooms and land, ready for inspection.
          
                              FURIOUS FIVE
                    Good morning master!
          
          One door remains closed.

                    Panda! Panda, wake up!
          
          He slides open Po's door. The room is empty.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                        (satisfied)
                    Hmm. He's quit.

          Shifu walks with a bit more energy.
          
                              VIPER
                    What do we do now, Master? With the
                    panda gone, who will be the Dragon
                    Warrior?
          
                              SHIFU
                    All we can do is resume our
                    training and trust that in time,
                    the true Dragon Warrior will be
                    revealed.
          
          
          INT. JADE PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Shifu enters the training hall, only to find himself face-to-
          face with Po's butt. Shifu and the Five are taken aback.
          
                              SHIFU
                    What are you doing here?!
          
          Reveal Po is in the middle of the floor, his legs spread wide
          apart. Po looks back over his shoulder to see Shifu and the
          Five enter the hall.
          
                              PO
                    Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I
                    thought I'd warm up a little.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You're stuck.
          
                              PO

                    Yeah, I'm stuck.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (to Crane)
                    Help him.
          
          Crane approaches Po.
          
                                                                 41.

                    Oh dear.
          
          Crane gingerly grabs Po's waistband and attempts to pull him
          up by flapping his wings.
          
                              PO
                    Maybe on three. One. Two-
          
          Crane pulls him up and Po flops onto his back.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)

                    --EVER.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You actually thought you could
                    learn to do a full split in one
                    night? It takes years to develop
                    one's flexibility and years longer
                    to apply it in combat.
          
          Shifu flings two boards into the air. Instantly, Tigress
          leaps up and executes a perfect split kick. Po is awestruck.
          As Tigress lands, the broken chunks of board land all around
          Po, knocking him on the head.
          
          Po collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir. Shifu
          notices and steps forward.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Put that down! The only souvenirs
                    we collect here are bloody knuckles
                    and broken bones.
          
                              PO
                    Yeah, excellent!
          
          He laughs excitedly and salutes Shifu.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Let's get started.

          MONTAGE
          
          Shifu snaps his fingers. Viper and Po face off.

                    I was born ready--
          
          Viper lashes her tail around Po's wrist, wrenches his arm
          back, flings him into the air and brings him crashing back
          down on his head.
          
                                PO (CONT'D)

          Shifu snaps.
          
          Monkey twirls a bamboo staff. He lunges at Po who takes a
          comical beating.
          
          Shifu snaps.
          
          Po and Crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl. CRASH. Po
          falls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup.
          
          Shifu snaps.
          
          We see a series of shots of Po falling on his face at the
          hands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be...
          Mantis.
          
          Shifu smiles. Flat on his back, Po manages a salute. Shifu
          has had it.
          
                              SHIFU
                    I've been taking it easy on you,
                    panda, but no more! Your next
                    opponent... will be me.
          
          Po looks excited.
          
                              PO
                    Alright! Let's go!
          
                                                                   43.
          
          
          The Five exchange worried looks.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (to Po)
                    Step forth.
          
          Po doesn't even finish the step as Shifu whirls him around
          and throws him to the floor pinning his arm behind him.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    The true path to victory is to find
                    your opponent's weakness and make
                    him suffer for it.
          
                              PO
                        (delighted)
                    Oh, yeah!
          
          Shifu whips Po around again.
          
                              SHIFU
                    To take his strength and use it
                    against him.
          
          Again, this time Shifu holds Po by the nose.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    --until he finally falls, or quits.
          
          Po is totally inspired.
          
                              PO
                    But a real warrior never quits.
                    Don't worry, Master, I will never
                    quit!
          
          At his breaking point, Shifu flings Po into the air and then
          leaps at him with a flying kick.

          Po crashes out of the door and tumbles down the steps.
          
          The Five watch him fall.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    If he's smart, he won't come back
                    up those steps.
          
                              MONKEY
                    But he will.

          Cut WIDE as Po continues to tumble.

          calligraphy in his. Po's yelps distract them.

                    Ow! Don't...
                        (laughing)
                    Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master
                    Shifu's trying to inspire me and
                    all, but if I didn't know any
                    better, I'd say he was trying to
                    get rid of me.
          
          Po chuckles. The others look at each other and chuckle
          awkwardly.
          
                              MANTIS
                    I know he can seem kind of
                    heartless--
          
          He violently jabs another needle in Po.
          
                              MANTIS (CONT'D)
                    But, ya know, he wasn't always like
                    that.
          
                              VIPER
                    According to legend, there was once
                    a time when Master Shifu actually
                    used to smile.

                    No.

                    Yes.
          
          Cut to Tigress out in the hallway. She can hear them talking.

                    Uh yeah, we're not really supposed
                    to talk about him.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Well, if he's going to stay here,
                    he should know.

          Tigress turns to Po.

                    He was a student, the first ever to
                    master the thousand...
          
          Tigress approaches Po and leans in towards him.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                        (nervously trailing off)

                    then he turned bad... and now he's
                    in jail.
          
          Tigress shakes her head at the panda's ignorance.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    He wasn't just a student.

          EXT. TRAINING HALL
          
          FLASHBACK. Shifu peeks out of the Training Hall and finds a
          baby leopard cub on the steps.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.)
                    Shifu found him as a cub. And he
                    raised him as a son.
          
          Baby Tai Lung pulls on Shifu's whiskers.
          
                                                                  47.

                    ...and when the boy showed talent
                    in Kung Fu...
          
          Baby Tai Lung punches the training dummy across the floor.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...Shifu trained him.
          
          Shifu teaches Baby Tai Lung how to punch.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    He believed in him. He told him he
                    was destined for greatness.
          
          Hard cut to a full-grown Tai Lung demolishing a training
          dummy.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    It was never enough for Tai Lung.
                    He wanted the Dragon Scroll. But
                    Oogway saw darkness in his heart
                    and refused. Outraged, Tai Lung
                    laid waste to the valley. He tried
                    to take the scroll by force. And
                    Shifu had to destroy what he had
                    created.
          
          Tai Lung ransacks a village on his way up to the Jade Palace.
          He crashes through the doors, running towards a waiting Shifu
          and Oogway.
          
          Shifu leaps at Tai Lung to deliver a kick.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But how could he?
          
          Seeing only baby Tai Lung running towards him, Shifu pulls
          his kick short. Tai Lung counters with a devastating strike
          and Shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg.
          
          Tai Lung leaps for the scroll, but Oogway stops him with
          strikes at his pressure points. He falls to the ground in a
          heap.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Shifu loved Tai Lung like he'd
                    never loved anyone before...
          
          Young Tigress in the training hall strikes the dummy in the
          same manner as Tai Lung. Shifu corrects her form. Nothing
          more. Young Tigress looks crestfallen.
          
                                                                     48.
          
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...or since.
          
          The sad, young Tigress cross-dissolves to adult Tigress.
          
          
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING
          
          Everyone is quiet in the moment.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    And now he has a chance to make
                    things right, to train the true
                    Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with
                    you: a big, fat panda who treats it
                    like a joke.
          
          Po makes a googly-eyed face.

                    Oh! That is it!
          
          Mantis pops up and halts Tigress.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Wait! My fault! I accidentally
                    tweaked his facial nerve.
          
          Po falls face first to the floor, revealing his back is
          covered with needles.
          
                              MANTIS (CONT'D)
                    And may have also stopped his
                    heart.
          
          
          INT. TRAINING HALL - NIGHT
          
          Shifu is sitting in meditation, fidgeting incessantly.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner
                    peace.
          
          He finally opens one eye.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Would whoever is making that
                    flapping sound, quiet down!
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
          Satisfied with the silence, Shifu nods and resumes his
          meditation.
          
                               SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Inner...
          
          BOOM. Zeng drops in from the ceiling.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use
                    some good news right now.
          
                               ZENG
                    Uh...

          EXT. JADE PALACE GROUNDS - EVENING
          
          Oogway stands under the peach tree, deep in thought. Shifu
          rushes in, emerging from the mist, extremely agitated.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master! Master!
          
                               OOGWAY
                    Hmmm?
          
                              SHIFU
                        (out of breath)
                    I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Ah, Shifu. There is just news.
                    There is no good or bad.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master, your vision...your vision
                    was right. Tai Lung has broken out
                    of prison. He's on his way!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    That is bad news...
          
          He turns to face Shifu and stares at him, eyebrow raised.
          
                              OOGWAY (CONT'D)
                    ...If you do not believe that the
                    Dragon Warrior can stop him.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The panda? Master, that panda is
                    not the Dragon Warrior.

                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    He wasn't even meant to be here --
                    it was an accident!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    There are no accidents.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Yes, I know. You've said that
                    already. Twice.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Well, that was no accident either.
          
                                SHIFU
                    Thrice.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    My old friend, the panda will never
                    fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,
                    until you let go of the illusion of
                    control.
          
                                SHIFU
                    Illusion?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I
                    cannot make it blossom when it
                    suits me, nor make it bear fruit
                    before its time.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But there are things we can
                    control.
          
          Shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    I can control when the fruit will
                    fall.
          
          A peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles. Shifu tosses
          the peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    And I can control--
          
          Shifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed
          in it.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    --where to plant the seed. That is
                    no illusion, Master.
          
                                                                 51.
          
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
                    that seed will grow to be a peach
                    tree. You may wish for an apple, or
                    an orange... but you will get a
                    peach.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

                    Maybe it can. If you are willing to
                    guide it, to nurture it. To believe
                    in it.
          
          Oogway covers the seed with dirt.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But how? How? I need your help,
                    Master.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    No, you just need to believe.
                    Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you
                    will believe.
          
                              SHIFU
                    I... I will try.
          
          Oogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to
          Shifu.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Good. My time has come. You must
                    continue your journey without me.
          
          He hands his staff to a confused Shifu.
          
                              SHIFU
                    What... what are you..?
          
          Oogway backs away into the swirling fog.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Master, you can't leave me!
          
          The petals surround Oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    You must believe.
          
                              SHIFU

          Shifu runs after him. Oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms.
          As the winds settle, Shifu is revealed standing at the edge
          of a cliff.
          
          Oogway is gone.
          
          We pan across to the bunkhouse.

          Po laughs. He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. When
          he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face --
          it looks like a moustache. Mantis snickers.

          bowls and holds them up like ears.

          As the rest of the Five laugh, Tigress sneaks a moment to
          smell Po's soup. Leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks
          up and stops. The Five also look up and stop laughing.
          
          Reveal Shifu has entered behind Po. He is holding Oogway's

                    anyone could change me, could make
                    me... not me, it was you. The
                    greatest kung fu teacher in all of
                    China.

                    But I can change you! I can turn
                    you into the Dragon Warrior! And I
                    will!

                    C'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here
                    right now. And even if it takes him
                    a hundred years to get here, how
                    are you gonna change this...
                        (indicate belly)
                    ...into the Dragon Warrior? How?
                    How? How?!
          
          In frustration, Shifu yells out the answer.
          
                              SHIFU
                    I don't know!!!

                    I don't know.

                    That's what I thought.
          
          Shifu walks away, leaving the path open to Po.
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - NIGHT
          
          Tigress stands in the moonlight outside the palace. She has
          seen what just transpired between Shifu and Po.
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
          She turns away, a look of resolve on her face... and LEAPS.
          
          She flies through the air, finally landing on a rooftop in
          the valley below. She looks back up at the palace.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    This is what you trained me for.
          
          She takes off running.
          
          The other four are right behind her.
          
                               VIPER
                    Tigress!
          
          She keeps going and they give chase.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Don't try and stop me!
          
          The chase continues through the village.
          
                              VIPER
                    We're not trying to stop you!

                              VIPER
                    We're coming with you!
          
          Then...the others join her. Tigress smiles. They leap off
          into the night.
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - EVENING
          
          Night dissolves to dawn. Shifu sits under the peach tree. He
          stirs, hearing KUNG FU NOISES from the training hall. He goes
          to investigate.

          Shifu looks inside -- it's empty. The NOISES continue from
          somewhere else -- the bunkhouse.

          As Shifu turns the corner he sees Po's shadow as he performs
          some amazing Kung Fu.
          
          Entering the kitchen, Shifu finds Po is stuffing his face
          with food. Seeing Shifu, he stops mid-munch.
          
          In silence they eye each other. Shifu surveys the room --
          broken lock, smashed doors, unhinged cabinets. Po belches.

                    What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?
          
          Shifu gets a glimmer in his eye. He has an idea.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Oh, no need to explain. I just
                    thought you might be Monkey -- he
                    hides his almond cookies on the top
                    shelf.
          
          Shifu calmly exits and hides just outside the doorway,
          waiting to see if his hunch is correct.
          
          KLUMP! KLONK! THUNK! Shifu peeks back inside and finds Po
          perched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his
          mouth. Po notices Shifu walking back in.

          He glances back down at Shifu, whose disbelief turns to a
          wise smile.

                    know. I was getting a cookie...
          
          He looks at the cookie and then can't help but eat it.

          He and Po stare at each other for a beat. Then... WHOOMP! Po
          slips and crashes to the kitchen floor. A cookie rolls over
          to Shifu. He picks it up.

          Shifu is sitting beneath a tree. Winded and wheezing, Po
          slowly works his way up the hill.
          
          Po sets his gear down and looks around. Shifu breathes in the
          morning mist as Po approaches.

          Shifu spar, vying for the dumplings. Until there is only one
          left.
          
          Shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po. He
          hides it underneath one of the bowls. He uses his chopsticks
          as weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away. He attacks Po with
          his bamboo staff.
          
          But Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final
          dumpling.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS
          
          The Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain
          peaks.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          Tai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge. He ROARS and
          races toward them.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Cut it!
          
          The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the
          mountain. Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the
          final rope. But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch
          herself into him. The two cats end up in the middle of the
          bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. The
          Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Where's the Dragon Warrior?
          
                              TIGRESS
                    How do you know you're not looking
                    at her?
          
          Tai Lung laughs. It echoes off the mountain walls.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You think I'm a fool? I know you're
                    not the Dragon Warrior. None of
                    you!
          
          The Five exchange quick, worried looks.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                        (nodding confidently)
                    I heard how he fell out of the sky
                    on a ball of fire, that he's a
                    warrior unlike anything the world
                    has ever seen.
          
          The Five exchange quick, confused looks.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Po?
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    So that is his name -- Po. Finally,
                    a worthy opponent. Our battle will
                    be legendary!
          
          Tigress charges at him. The battle begins. Tigress punches
          Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge. But Tai Lung counters
          with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through
          the bridge's wooden slats. Then Tigress gets choked by the
          bridge's ropes. Monkey turns to Crane and Viper.
          
                              MONKEY
                    We've got this. Help her!
          
                                                                     65.
          
          
          Viper grabs Tai Lung, which causes him to let go of the
          ropes. Tigress plummets down into the gorge... but Crane
          manages to catch her. Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with
          his own fist. Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Viper's
          "throat".
          
                              VIPER
                    Monkey!
          
          ANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY. Mantis is straining to hold the
          rope by himself.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Go!
                        (then)
                    Ack! What was I thinking?!
          
          Monkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and
          sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. He gets
          back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single
          strand of rope.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Mantis!
          
          Mantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave
          shooting toward Tai Lung. The rope whips Tai Lung in the face
          and he gets tangled up. The Five see their chance.
          
                              TIGRESS (CONT'D)
                    Now!
          
          Working as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which
          way. Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai
          Lung. He plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist.
          Mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies
          safely to the mountain.
          
          The Five look relieved. But the relief is short-lived...
          
          Tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling
          the far mountain peak. Her eyes go wide with dread. The rope
          whips up. But Tai Lung isn't there.
          
          With a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Shifu taught you well...
          
          Tai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    But he didn't teach you everything.
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
          Tai lung lunges toward the rest.
          
          
          EXT. TRAINING HALL - EVENING
          
          Shifu and Po walk through the palace courtyard. Po has an
          easy spring in his step.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You have done well, Panda.
          
                              PO
                    Done well? Done well?! I've done
                    awesome!
          
          He swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance.
          
          Shifu staggers back, regaining his dignity.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The mark of a true hero is
                    humility!
          
          After a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po -
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    But yes...you have done awesome.
          
          And he punches him playfully on the arm. Po smiles at him. As
          they LAUGH, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind
          them. IT'S CRANE!
          
          Crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a
          heap.
          
                              PO
                    Huh? Guys? Guys!
          
          Po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    They're dead? No, they're
                    breathing! They're asleep?! No,
                    their eyes are open.
          
          Crane struggles to lift his head.
          
                              CRANE
                    We were no match for his nerve
                    attack.
          
          His head collapses to the ground.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
                              SHIFU
                    He has gotten stronger.
          
                              PO
                    Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
          
          Shifu starts freeing the Five. First Viper, then Mantis, then
          Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis -
          
                              MONKEY
                    He's too fast!
          
          He delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly
          realizes where he is.
          
                                 MONKEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, Po.
          
          Shifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    I thought we could stop him.
          
                              SHIFU
                    He could have killed you.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Why didn't he?
          
                              SHIFU
                    So you could come back here and
                    strike fear into our hearts. But it
                    won't work!
          
                              PO
                    Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm
                    pretty scared.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You can defeat him, panda.
          
                              PO
                    Are you kidding? If they can't--
                    They're five masters. I'm just one
                    me.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But you will have the one thing
                    that no one else does.
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
          INT. SCROLL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          CLOSE-UP of the Dragon Scroll. Po stares at Shifu - then
          looks up at the Scroll. Then back at Shifu -
          
                              PO
                    You really believe I'm ready?
          
                              SHIFU
                    You are, Po.
          
          They look at each other. This is a big moment.
          
          Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. As Po
          and The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the
          reflecting pool. Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still
          closed, he raises the staff up above his head. Po and the
          others watch, expectantly. The peach blossom petals rise in a
          flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. The gentle
          tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the
          Dragon Scroll. The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's
          mouth and it falls. At the last second, Shifu reaches out
          with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. He turns
          to Po, holding it out.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is
                    yours.
          
                              PO
                    Wait, what happens when I read it?
          
                               SHIFU
                    No one knows, but legend says you
                    will be able to hear a butterfly's
                    wing-beat.
          
                              PO
                    Whoa! Really? That's cool.

                    Yes. And see light in the deepest
                    cave. You will feel the universe in
                    motion around you.

                              SHIFU
                    Focus. Focus.
          
                                                                  69.

                    Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Read it, Po, and fulfill your
                    destiny. Read it and become... the
                    Dragon Warrior!
          
                                PO
                    Whooaa!!!
          
          Po takes a deep breath. Then he grasps the tube and tries to
          pull the top off it. It doesn't budge. He strains at it.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    It's impossible to open.
          
          He strains again. He tries to bite it off...
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Come on baby. Come on now...
          
          Shifu SIGHS and holds out his hand. Po passes him the tube.
          Shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Thank you. I probably loosened it
                    up for you though... Okay, here
                    goes.
          
          He glances at the Five. They look on in awe. Monkey gives him
          the `thumbs up.' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden
          light bathing his face. Across the scroll we see Shifu,
          excited that he is witness to history...
          
          On Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll.
          
          Then -
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
          
          Shifu looks concerned. The Five look concerned. Po looks
          utterly terrified.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    It's blank!
          
                                SHIFU
                    What?
          
                              PO
                    Here! Look!

          Po tries to show Shifu the scroll. Shifu covers his eyes and
          turns his head away.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No! I am forbidden to look upon--
          
          But he can't help himself. He takes a peek. Then he GRABS if
          off Po. He turns it around, then upside down. He closes it
          and opens it again, astonished.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Blank? I don't...I don't
                    understand.
          
          Shifu turns away, contemplative. What can this mean?
          
                              PO
                    Okay. So like, Oogway was just a
                    crazy old turtle after all?
          
                              SHIFU
                    No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
          
          Po sits heavily on the floor, dejected.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me
                    by accident. Of course I'm not the
                    Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
          
          The Five don't argue.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    But who will stop Tai Lung?
          
                              CRANE
                    He'll destroy everything...and
                    everyone.
          
          Shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it. He
          looks oddly calm as he turns around.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No, evacuate the Valley. You must
                    protect the villagers from Tai
                    Lung's rage.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    What about you master?
          
                              SHIFU
                    I will fight him.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
                              PO
                    What?
          
                              SHIFU
                    I can hold him off long enough for
                    everyone to escape.
          
                              PO
                    But Shifu, he'll kill you.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Then I will finally have paid for
                    my mistake.
          
          The Five and Po look devastated.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Listen to me, all of you. It is
                    time for you to continue your
                    journey without me. I am very proud
                    to have been your master.
          
          Shifu salutes them and turns away. Po is heartbroken. Crane
          steps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po, pulling away.
          
          Po resists for a moment, then lets the Five lead him off.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          The Five arrive at the base of the stairs.

          Monkey picks up a small child.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Come, little one. Let's find your
                    mama.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Viper, gather the southern farmers.
                    Mantis, the north. Crane, light the
                    way.
          
          They split up and begin helping the villagers evacuate. Po is
          left by himself.
          
          He makes his way through the bustling town.
          
                                                                     72.

                    Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
          
          Po approaches the Noodle Shop.
          
                                PO
                    Hey, Dad.
          
                                PO'S DAD
                    Po!
          
          Seeing Po, Po's Dad hurries over and wraps his arms around
          his son. Po bends down to reciprocate the hug, as Po's dad
          pulls away, having fastened an apron around Po's waist.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Good to have you back, son!
          
                              PO
                        (listlessly)
                    Good to be back.
          
          Po's Dad goes back to packing things up.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Let's go Po. So, for our next shop,
                    it's time to face it -- the future
                    of noodles is dice-cut vegetables,
                    no longer slices.
          
          Dad starts to walk off, unaware that Po isn't following.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Also, I was thinking, maybe this
                    time we'll have a kitchen you can
                    actually stand up in. Hmm? You like
                    that?
          
          He turns and notices that Po hasn't moved. He walks to Po
          sympathetically.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Po, I'm sorry things didn't work
                    out. It just... wasn't meant to be.
          
          Po slumps against the cart.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Po, forget everything else. Your
                    destiny still awaits. We are noodle
                    folk -- broth runs deep through our
                    veins.
          
                                                                  73.
          
          
                              PO
                    I don't know, Dad. Honestly,
                    sometimes I can't believe I'm
                    actually your son.
          
          Dad is taken aback.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Po, I think it's time I told you
                    something I should have told you a
                    long time ago...
          
                                PO
                    Okay.
          
          Dad pauses dramatically.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    The secret ingredient of my secret
                    ingredient soup!
          
          Po feigns excitement.
          
                                PO
                    Oh.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    C'mere! The secret ingredient is...
                    nothing!
          
                                PO
                    Huh?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    You heard me. Nothing. There is no
                    secret ingredient!
          
                              PO
                    Wait wait...it's just plain old
                    noodle soup? You don't add some
                    kind of special sauce or something?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Don't have to. To make something
                    special, you just have to believe
                    it's special.
          
          Po looks at his father with dawning realization. He picks up
          the Scroll.
          
          For a moment, Po stares at his reflection on the scroll, then
          he smiles serenely. He gets it now.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
                              PO
                    There is no secret ingredient...
          
          Po turns back to look at the palace.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - DAWN
          
          At the top of the stairs, Shifu looks upon the Valley,
          awaiting his fate. With a gust of wind, Tai Lung appears
          before him.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    I have come home, Master.
          
                              SHIFU
                    This is no longer your home. And I
                    am no longer your master.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Yes. You have a new favorite. So
                    where is this...Po? Did I scare him
                    off?
          
                              SHIFU
                    This battle is between you and me.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    So. That is how it's going to be?
          
                              SHIFU
                    That is how it must be.
          
          They fight. At last. Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the
          doors of the Jade Palace.
          
          Tai Lung enters.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    I rotted in jail for twenty years
                    because of your weakness!
          
                              SHIFU
                    Obeying your master is not
                    weakness!
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!
                    You always knew...
          
          Dissolve to FLASHBACK.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          A young Tai Lung looks expectant. Oogway shakes his head.
          
                              TAI LUNG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But when Oogway said otherwise,
                    what did you do? What did you do?!
          
          Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past
          dissolves into the present.
          
                                 TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    NOTHING!
          
          Shifu takes a Kung Fu stance.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You were not meant to be the Dragon
                    Warrior! That was not my fault!
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    NOT YOUR FAULT?!
          
          Enraged, Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and
          throws them at Shifu.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?!
                    WHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY
                    BONES CRACKED?! WHO DENIED ME MY
                    DESTINY?!
          
          Shifu dodges each attack.
          
                              SHIFU
                    It was never my decision to make!
          
          Tai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine.
          
                                 TAI LUNG
                    It is now.
          
          They fight. Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    Give me the scroll!
          
                              SHIFU
                    I would rather die.
          
          They struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters
          into a hundred pieces. Shifu looks back at the pieces and a
          flutter of peach tree petals fly by. Caught off guard, Shifu
          gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.
          
                                                                   76.
          
          
          Shifu climbs the column to the rafters. Tai Lung follows and
          sends them both crashing through the roof.
          
          Lightning flash.
          
          Grappling in mid-air, Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifu's
          throat as they crash back through the roof.
          
          They kick apart. Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.
          Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the
          floor. Flames go everywhere. Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he
          charges at Shifu.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    All I ever did, I did to make you
                    proud! Tell me how proud you are,
                    Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!
          
          THOOM! A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor
          and crashing against the reflecting pool. The flames
          extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (weakly)
                    I have always been proud of you.
                    From the first moment, I've been
                    proud of you. And it was my pride
                    that blinded me. I loved you too
                    much to see what you were becoming.
                    What I was turning you into. I'm...
                    sorry.
          
          Tai Lung stops in his tracks. Shifu waits. Tai Lung's
          expression goes cold. He grabs Shifu by the throat.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    I don't want your apology. I want
                    my scroll!
          
          He holds Shifu up to the ceiling. Looking up, Tai Lung
          bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    WHAT? WHERE IS IT?!
          
          Tai Lung slams Shifu to the floor.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (weakly)
                    Dragon Warrior has taken scroll
                    halfway across China by now. You
                    will never see that scroll, Tai
                    Lung. Never. Never...
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          Tai Lung is furious. He roars, ready to strike Shifu.
          Suddenly...
          
                               PO (O.S.)
                    Hey!
          
          Tai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                        (out of breath)
                    Stairs...
          
          Tai Lung casts Shifu aside.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Who are you?
          
                              PO
                    Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
                        (exhales hard)
                    Huhhh...
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You?! Him?!
                        (to Shifu)
                    He's a panda.
                        (back to Po)
                    You're a panda. What are you gonna
                    do, big guy? Sit on me?
          
                              PO
                    Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna
                    use this. You want it? Come and get
                    it.
          
          Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.
          
          From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across
          the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    Finally!
          
          Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung,
          sending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and
          strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to
          run.
          
          Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace
          steps.
          
          Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends
          him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
          Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and
          smash Tai Lung. He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes
          right back at Po.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    That scroll is mine!
          
          Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the
          scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down
          stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down
          on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the
          scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po
          snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies
          towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,
          but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart
          which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the
          noodle.
          
          Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees
          and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the
          street.
          
          As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array
          of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around
          to hide the scroll.
          
                                 PO
                    Lightning!
          
          Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po
          uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes
          out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll
          rolls down the steps towards the river.
          
          Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases
          down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the
          fireworks-filled sky.
          
          Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The
          scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an
          ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who
          sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-
          vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is
          shocked.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    The scroll has given him power.
                        (then)
                    NOOO0!!
          
          He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting
          shockwave collapses the building.
          
                                                                    79.
          
          
          Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach
          the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and
          unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the
          ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating
          punch.
          
          As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the
          impact crater.
          
                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                          (out of breath)
                      Finally... oh yes... the power of
                      the Dragon Scroll... is mine!
          
          Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.
          
                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                      It's NOTHING!!
          
          Po stirs.
          
                                PO
                      It's okay. I didn't get it the
                      first time either.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                          (disbelief)
                      What?
          
          Po gets to his feet.
          
                                PO
                      There is no secret ingredient. It's
                      just you.
          
          Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.
          
                                   TAI LUNG
                      RRRAAAH!
          
                                   PO
                      AAAAGGGHH!
          
          Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.
          
                                PO (CONT'D)
                      Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee!
                      Don't! Don't!
          
          Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he
          delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms
          come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing
          back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what
          he just did.
          
          Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po
          strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even
          getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai
          Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai
          Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po
          prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY!
          He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until
          finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the
          ground.
          
          Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                          (heavy breathing)
                      You... can't defeat me. You're just
                      a big, fat panda!
          
          SCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide.
          
                                PO
                      I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the
                      big, fat panda.
          
          Po's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                      The Wuxi Finger Hold!
          
                                PO
                      Oh, you know this hold?
          
                                TAI LUNG
                      You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
                      Shifu didn't teach you that.
          
                                PO
                      Nope. I figured it out.
          
          He flexes his pinky...
          
                                  PO (CONT'D)
                      Skadoosh!
          
          KA-THOOM!
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY OF PEACE
          
          A mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the
          Furious Five and the fleeing villagers.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER
          
          Villagers emerge from hiding. Po walks out from the mist
          looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.
          
                              KG SHAW
                    Look! The Dragon Warrior.
          
          As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and
          his scarf is a torn apron.
          
          Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the
          crowd.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    That's my boy. That big, lovely
                    kung fu warrior is my son!
          
                              PO
                    Thanks, Dad.
          
          Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the
          ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest
          of the Five are with him. Po takes notice.
          
                                 PO (CONT'D)
                    Hey, guys.

                    Master.
          
          Tigress bows deeply. The others follow.
          
                                 FURIOUS FIVE

                        (then, remembering)
                    Master Shifu!
          
          Po races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then
          more steps.
          
                                                                  82.
          
          
          INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still
          lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his
          side.
          
                              PO
                    Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
          
          Shifu weakly opens his eyes.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Po! You're alive!
                        (then, darkly)
                    Or we're both dead.
          
                              PO
                    No, Master, I didn't die. I
                    defeated Tai Lung!
          
                                SHIFU
                    You did?!
          
          Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Wow. It is as Oogway foretold --
                    You are the Dragon Warrior. You
                    have brought peace to this Valley.
                    And to me. Thank you. Thank you,
                    Po. Thank you...
          
          Shifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.
          
                              PO
                    No! Master! No No No! Don't die,

                              SHIFU
                        (eyes snapping open)

          pupil lie next to each other. The camera pulls up and back
          away from them. Po tries to remain still, but it's hard.

          Viking explorer LEIF ERICSON carefully studies his fob compass as 
          he dangles it above a parchment map. His SAILORS steal nervous 
          looks at a large, diabolical-looking IRON BOX in the hold.
           
          OLAF, a fierce, one-eyed Viking warrior approaches Ericson. NOTE: 
          Dialog is in OLD NORSE, with SUBTITLES)
           
          OLAF
          Leif, let's do the deed
          before another night falls. The crew's
          near mutiny.
           
          Ericson draws his broadsword with a flourish.
           
          LEIF ERICSON
          Know this! The first man to turn
          will taste my steel in his guts.
           
          OLAF
          But we've surely gone far enough.
           
          ERICSON
          That accursed box must be thrown
          off the edge of the world. We
          will go until we can go no more...
           
          Suddenly there is an ear-splitting SCREECH and the entire boat 
          rocks violently as it runs aground.
           
          The LOOKOUT is thrown from his crow's nest... and CRASHES 
          straight through the deck right in front of Ericson. His pained 
          voice floats up 
          from the black hole.
           
          LOOKOUT
          ...Land ho.
           
          Ericson wheels about just as the fog parts off the starboard bow.

          Olaf finishes digging a hole in the sand. He backs away, 
          terrified, as burly Vikings, led by Ericson, muscle the IRON BOX 
          over to the hole and 
          quickly bury it. Ericson turns to an exotic-looking Eurasian 
          WITCH.
           
          ERICSON
          Be quick, Witch. Let the deed
          be done.
           
          The Witch unravels a scroll and recites:
           
          WITCH
          Oh Loki, ancient one. Thy mischief
          dwell now in waters, base and
          bland. And in waves and sand thy
          magic forever sleep...
           
          As the Witch speaks, a strong wind kicks up and a black wall of 
          clouds appears. The sky explodes in THUNDER and LIGHTNING. The 
          MEN 
          look about fearfully.
           
          ERICSON (CONT.)
          Back to the ship men, hurry.
           
          OLAF
          Captain, you've discovered a new
          world. It is your right to name it.
           
          ERICSON
          Leave that to the Italians. We're
          never coming back here. Never.
          This land is now cursed.

          Look at those clouds rollin' in,
          man. Freaky weather.
           
          STANLEY IPKISS, a bright0eyed amiable young account exec pauses 
          by Charlie's desk and drops off a print-out.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey Charlie, can you go over these
          stats? We're supposed to have
          a complete report before lunch.
           
          Charlie takes one looks at the complex print-outs and tosses them 
          back.
           
          CHARLIE
          Woah. Sorry Stanley, I just had
          my weave tightened and my head
          is killing me. Be a pal and take
          those over to Hinkleman, will ya?
           
          MAGGIE, a cute young blonde now strolls by.

          Hi guys. Did you have any luck
          with those concert tickets
          Stanley?
           
          Stanley perks up at the sight of her.
           
          STANLEY
          I sure did. Friday night, just
          like you wanted.
           
          MAGGIE
          Oh, Stanley, that's wonderful.
           
          STANLEY
          What time should I pick you up?
           
          MAGGIE
          Gee, I don't know. My best
          girlfriend just got into town and
          I know she'd love to go. Can we
          get an extra ticket for her?
           
          STANLEY
          Well... uh, actually it's sold
          out. I was kinda lucky to get
          these.
           
          MAGGIE
          She's only going to be in town
          a couple of days and I just can't
          let her sit at home all alone.
          Are you sure there isn't something
          we can do?
           
          Stanley considers the situation for a moment, then pulls the 
          tickets out of his pocket.
           
          STANLEY
          You know what? Here. You two
          go.
           
          MAGGIE
          Oh Stanley, I couldn't do that.
           
          STANLEY
          No really. Go ahead. It's okay.
          I hate concerts anyway. All that,
          you know... music floating around.
           
          Maggie snatches the tickets from Stanley's hand.
           
          MAGGIE
          That is so sweet. Sheila's just
          going to love this.
           
          STANLEY
          So maybe you and I can get
          together over the weekend?
           
          MAGGIE
          I'm not sure what's going on, but
          just give me a call. You know
          I like to be spontaneous.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, sure. Me too.
           
          MAGGIE
          Stanley Ipkiss, you are the nicest
          guy.
           
          Maggie gives him a quick air-kiss and hurries off to her teller's 
          window.
           
          CHARLIE
          That's it.
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          CHARLIE
          The kiss of death. As soon as
          they use the "N" word it's all
          over.
           
          STANLEY
          So maybe I am a nice guy. So
          what?
           
          CHARLIE
          You are a rug. I am talking
          astro-turf here. You're letting
          these women sharpen their cleats
          on you.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey, I'm a gentleman. If they
          can't appreciate that, it's their
          problem.
           
          CHARLIE
          You spend too much time being
          "nice" to a girl, you'll wind up
          sittin' around listening to her
          complain about the son of a bitch
          she really loves.
           
          STANLEY
          Charlie, you are a very sick
          puppy.
           
          CHARLIE
          Wake up, Stanley! These are the
          nineties. We're dealing with an
          entire generation of dysfunctional
          love junkies. You can't romance
          'em. You gotta confuse 'em. It's
          the only thing that gets their
          attention.
          (PAUSES)
          Let me demonstrate. You see that
          girl over there?
           
          Stanley looks over at the coffee service where an attractive 
          young WOMAN is pouring herself a cup of coffee.
           
          CHARLIE (CONT.)
          Hi Lisa.

          Oh, hi...

          Charlie.
           
          LISA
          That's right. Sorry.
           
          CHARLIE
          Lisa, this may seem a little odd,
          but my friend over there and I
          were having this discusion and
          I thought maybe you could settle
          it for us.
           
          LISA
          I'll help out if I can.
           
          CHARLIE
          (SHEEPISHLY)
          Actually, I don't know... this
          is kind of a personal question.
           
          LISA
          That's okay. Go ahead.
           
          CHARLIE
          Alright. Just for the sake of
          argument, if I wasn't a happily
          married man... am I the kind of
          guy you'd go out with?
           
          LISA
          Oh, um... I don't know.
          (PAUSES)
          Well... yeah. I guess I would.
           
          CHARLIE
          Lisa, I have terrific news for
          you.
           
          LISA
          What?
           
          CHARLIE
          I'm not married! Is this perfect
          or what? Listen, there's not a
          lot of women willing to come right
          out like that and admit they're
          attracted to a guy, but...
           
          Lisa SLAPS Charlie, turns on her heel, and marches off.
           
          CHARLIE (CONT.)
          Jeez... make up your mind.
           
          Stanley gives Charlie the fish eye as he returns.
           
          CHARLIE
          Okay. Bad example. Some
          of these women got so much baggage
          they need an emotional sky cap.
          I'll tell you what Stanley,
          tonight I'm gonna take you on a
          love safari, deep into the darkest
          heart of the urban jungle.
           
          STANLEY
          And where's that?
           
          CHARLIE
          The Monkey's Paw. Hottest new
          club in town. It's a guaranteed
          skirt alert and no dead beats
          allowed.
           
          STANLEY
          So how are we gonna get in?
           
          CHARLIE
          Woah, do I detect a little
          self-image problem there, buddy?
          You just leave everything to me.
          This, my friend is going to be
          the perfect night on the town.
           
          Suddenly a resounding peal of THUNDER rings out like the crack of 
          doom. Sheets of rain pour down on the bank's windows.

          A young woman scurries into the bank holding a newspaper over her

          herself out.
           
          Charlie immediately notices her...
           
          CHARLIE
          Hold the phone. Killer at three
          o'clock.

          is undeniable proof that there is a God... up... up... to her 
          face as that 
          newspaper is tossed aside. She's a heart-stopping woman/child

          eyes.
           
          Tina now enters and walks towards Stanley and Charlie.

          Excuse me, where can I open a new
          account?

          You've come to the right place,
          ma'am. Just step right this way
          and pull up a chair...
           
          Charlie tries to steer Tina to his desk, but she's still 
          preoccupied with her damp clothing.
           
          TINA
          Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a complete
          wreck. Will you hold this please?
           
          She hands her shoulder bag to Stanley and peels off her wet 
          blazer, creating another awe-inspiring visual moment.
           
          CHARLIE
          Here, let me take that for you.
           
          Charlie clutches her jacket with white knuckles.
           
          TINA
          Thanks.
           
          But Tina turns and sits at Stanley's desk; Charlie is stunned at 
          his near miss, but there's not a thing he can do about it.
           
          STANLEY
          So, uh, what kind of account did
          you have in mind?
           
          TINA
          (smiles sweetly)
          Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm
          just terrible with things like
          that. That's an interesting tie
          Mr...?
           
          STANLEY
          Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss...
           
          Tina extends her hand.
           
          TINA
          Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet
          you.
           
          STANLEY
          The, uh... pleasure's all mine.
           
          Tina notices a box of Kleenex on Stanley's desk.
           
          TINA
          May I? I'm such a mess.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh... of course.
           
          Tina takes out a compact and daintily blots the moisture from her 
          face.
           
          TINA
          As I was saying about that tie. It's
          like one of those, what do you
          call them, ink blot tests.
           
          STANLEY
          A Rorschach test.
           
          She twists open a tube of lip gloss andbegins to run it across 
          her incredibly lush liips.
           
          TINA
          That's it. It looks like... um.
          A young woman riding bareback.
          You know, like a Lady Godiva or
          something.
           
          STANLEY
          Really? I don't think I can...
           
          She slowly runs a finger along Stanley's tie.
           
          TINA
          Or... if that's not a horse it
          could be two lovers. A man and
          a woman. That would be the woman
          on top, of course.
           
          STANLEY
          (MESMERIZED)
          ...Of course.
           
          She licks her lips and blots them on the Kleenex, leaving a 
          perfect kiss impression and drops it on Stanley's desk.
           
          TINA
          What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?
           
          Stanley starts to get uncomfortable under her gaze.
           
          STANLEY
          I don't know. ...Bold colors.
          It's a power tie, y'know? They're
          supposed to make you feel...
          powerful.
           
          TINA
          Does it work?
           
          STANLEY
          Sort of. It's just a tie. Now,
          about that account.
           
          CLOSE-UP
           
          as Tina drops her compact back in her shoulder bag and we see her 
          flick a red L.E.D. light on. She carefully adjusts the bag, 
          aiming a tiny 
          CAMERA LENS neatly concealed within it.
           
          Tina's pointing the bag at the open bank vault that stands a 
          short distance from Stanley's desk.

          a week.

          Not cool. What about the coin?

          There's plenty. And I'll be happy
          to invest your share.

          Dorian pulls back a curtain. An amazingly gaudy building stands

          and it will drive this two bit
          club of mine out of existence.
          But I say if you can't beat 'em,
          take 'em over.

          A large WHARF RAT now creeps out along the garbage sniffing

          Stanley and Charlie are riding along at breakneck speed in a taxi 
          cab.
           
          STANLEY
          Hold it up right here, please.
           
          A gun port suddenly SLAMS open and the wild-eyed Albanian TAXI 
          DRIVER wheels about and cocks a huge .45 from his side of the 
          BULLET 
          riddled partition as the cab continues to barrel through traffic.
           
          DRIVER
          Hold up?! No hold up! I keel
          you very well! I splatter your
          guts big time, Mr. Cowboy Man!
           
          Stanley dives for cover.
           
          CHARLIE
          No! No! He only wants you to
          stop the cab!
           
          The driver instantly SLAMS on the brakes, throwing his passengers 
          forward mercilessly.
           
          DRIVER
          (now totally calm)
          Hokay. Pardon you very much.
           
          Charlie helps Stanley sit back up.
           
          CHARLIE
          It's alright, Stanley.
           
          STANLEY

          I hate this town. I really hate

          Why are you getting out here?

          I gotta pick up my car.

          Fine. Now don't forget. Ten
          o'clock at the Monkey's Paw. I've
          already got us lined up with a

          Stanley enters the grease spattered, cluttered garage and scans 
          the area for signs of life. We can hear the CLANK-CLANK-CRASH of 
          SOME 
          less than light-fingered automotive work in progress.
           
          Stanley DINGS a little service bell sitting on a counter 
          plastered with naked playmate decoupage and Mrs. Power Tool '93 
          calendars.
           
          STANLEY
          ...Hello?
           
          IRV, a lumbering unshaven behemoth of a man with permanently low-
          slung refrigerator repairman pants, makes his way past half 
          rebuilt car 
          carcasses towards Stanley.
           
          IRV
          Hang on. Hong on. Don't get your
          panties in a twist.
           
          BURT, a thinner version of Irv with Coke bottle glasses and a mop 
          of greasy hair, pops up from beneath a car, RIPS out of chunk of 
          motor and 
          wiring and holds it up to Irv.
           
          BURT
          (examining part)
          Hey Irv, what the hell is this?
           
          IRV
          (eyes it carefully)
          Ohh... I dunno. About seven
          hundred bucks.
           
          They both laugh evilly as Irv slaps Burt on the back. Irv makes 
          his way over to Stanley, still chuckling to himself.
           
          IRV
          Now what can I do for you, Bub?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm here for the Civic.
           
          IRV
          Japanese car, right? Kind of a
          nasty pea soup green?
           
          STANLEY
          Well, they call it Emeral Forest,
          actually...
           
          Irv turns back to Burt.
           
          IRV
          Burt! Pea green Civic!
           
          Burt pops back up from beneath the hood.
           
          BURT
          Green Civic... Green Civic. Oh
          yeah! Brake drums are still on
          order and I'm only halfway through
          rebuilding the trans.
           
          STANLEY
          But I just brought it in for an
          oil change!
           
          IRV
          Yeah? Well you're lucky we caught
          those other problems before they
          caused some serious trouble.
           
          STANLEY
          Alright. Alright. When will it
          be ready?
           
          Irv looks over at Burt, who gives him a "Make something up" look.
           
          IRV
          Come back tomorro...
          (Burt shakes his head "no".)
          ...First thing next wee...
          (Burt shakes again)
          ...next month?
          (Burt shakes an enthusiastic "yes".)
          Yeah, first thing next month.
          That's if we can get the parts.
           
          STANLEY
          What am I going to do in the
          meantime? I can't afford to keep
          taking cabs all over town.
           
          Irv smiles a rotten-toothed smile.
           
          IRV
          Oh, hell... we can take care of
          that!
          (to Burt archly)
          Hey Burt, bring around the loaner.
          (to Stanley)
          And for you little buddy, only
          ten bucks a day.

          The joint is jumping with musclehead BOUNCERS picking and 
          choosing from the crowd of terminally trendy WANNABE'S gathered 
          around the 
          entrance. A light drizzle is falling.
           
          A parade of swanky cars pulls up one by one as CAR HOPS scurry to 
          keep up with the flow;
           
          A glistening pearlescent Rolls Royce.
           
          A fire engine red Ferrari.
           
          A classic two tone Corniche in tan and burgundy.
           
          And finally a broken down Citroen in rust bucket red and spackle 
          gray RUMBLES up to the front of the club with a disgruntled 
          Stanley behind 
          the wheel.
           
          A car hop attempts to open the door, but it's rusted shut. 
          Stanley throws his shoulder into it and the door finally pops 
          open with a SCREECH of 
          metal. Stanley nearly tumbles out into the street.
           
          He smiles nervously at a high class couple looking with disdain 
          at the eyesore-mobile. He pats the hood.
           
          STANLEY
          It's a classic.
           
          The car hop jumps in and tries to throw the car into gear with a 
          horrible GRINDING. He finally waves over two other car hops who 
          quickly push 
          it off down the street.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hey, Stanley. Nice wheels. What
          is that, a Rolls Canardley?
           
          STANLEY
          A what?
           
          CHARLIE
          You know, a Rolls Canardley.
          Rolls down one hill canardley roll
          up the next.

          okay?
           
          CHARLIE
          Whatever you say, man.
           
          Charlie gestures expansively towards the club.
           
          CHARLIE
          What do you think? Pretty
          terrific, huh? This place make
          Sodom and Gomorrah look like
          Mayberry.
           
          Stanley now notices a life-sized poster of Tina Carlyle standing 
          by the main entrance that reads "Featuring the Musical Stylings 
          of Miss Tina 
          Carlyle."
           
          STANLEY
          Hey, isn't that...
           
          CHARLIE
          Right. The wet dream from the
          bank.
          (PAUSES)
          Hold on... I think I see my future
          ex-wife.
           
          Two rather tacky looking GIRLS beckon Charlie from the crowd.
           
          GIRLS
          Hey Charlie! Charlie!
           
          CHARLIE
          (WAVES)
          We're in luck. It's Barbie and
          Pebbles.
           
          STANLEY
          Doesn't it bother you that all
          the women you know are named after
          cartoon characters?
           
          Barbie and Pebbles hurry over through the crowd.
           
          BARBIE
          We've been waiting out here for
          hours. Can you get us in?
           
          CHARLIE
          No, problemo. Ladies, this is my
          pal Stanley Ipkiss.
          (leans closer)
          Stanley's very influential in the
          banking business.
           
          Charlie is truly in his element as he elbows his way through the 
          crowd dragging his entourage with him.
           
          EXT. THE FRONT DOOR
           
          Charlie finally makes through the crush of badies at the entry 
          way's velvet ropes and calls to one of the two hulking BOUNCERS 
          that guard the 
          door.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What's
          happening man?
           
          Bobby completely ignores Charlie as he ushers a pasty faced ROCK 
          STAR and his underage TARTLET past the ropes.
           
          CHARLIE (CONT.)
          (to the girls)
          This will just take a second.
          (to the other bouncer)
          Yo Nick! It's me... Charlie!
           
          Nick is also completely oblivious.
           
          STANLEY
          Forget it, Charlie. I refuse to
          stand here waiting to be judged
          by these power-mad steroid
          jockeys.
           
          CHARLIE
          How much cash you got on you?
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          CHARLIE
          You heard me. How much you got?
           
          STANLEY
          I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hand it over.
           
          STANLEY
          No way.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only
          carrying plastic. C'mon man, you
          want to stand out here all night?
           
          Stanley begrudgingly starts to count out some cash. Charlie 
          snatches the whole wad and elbows his way back around to the 
          ropes.
           
          CHARLIE
          (subtly flashing bills)
          Hey Bobby!
           
          Bobby's uncanny tip radar suddenly lights up.
           
          BOBBY
          Charlie, how you doin' man? Long
          time no see.
           
          Bobby unsnaps the rope for Charlie and gets the cash handshake he 
          longs for.
           
          The crowd surges around Charlie, Barbie and Pebbles as they step 
          by, briefly cutting Stanley off.
           
          He catches up just as the all-important rope is SNAPPED closed.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey, wait a minute! Charlie!
           
          But Charlie and the girls have already been whisked inside. 
          Dorian now steps out of the club and begins to check Bobby's 
          list.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          I'm with them! Hey, Bobby!
           
          But Bobby is back into his deaf and dumb routine. Stanley unsnaps 
          the rope himself and starts throgh. Bobby and BOUNCER #2 
          IMMEDIATELY 
          grab Stanley and quickly subdue him.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey! Leggo... awk!
           
          Dorian glares at Stanley.
           
          DORIAN
          Lose him.
           
          The bouncers drag Stanley through the crowd and unceremoniously 
          toss him out into the rain-slick street.
           
          ANGLE ON THE STREET
           
          Stanley slowly rises, smoothing out his disheveled clothing. A 
          horn BLARES and Stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings 
          into the 
          club's alleyway, splattering him with a wave of muddy water.
           
          Stanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see Tina 
          Carlyle escorted from the back of the limo by a CHAUFFEUR 
          carrying an umbrella. 
          She's shoe-horned into a heart-stopping red dress that's fighting 
          a losing battle to restrain her decolletage.
           
          Their EYES MEET. Tina pauses as she recognizes him.
           
          TINA
          (SMILES)
          Oh... Stanley. Hi.
           
          Stanley realizes he looks ridiculous but gives a pathetic little 
          wave hello anyway.
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          Are you okay?
           
          Stanley gestures "no problem" and tries to strike a casual pose 
          against a street lamp, but slips and nearly falls.
           
          With a SQUEAL of grinding gears and the KA-POW of a backfire, the 
          car hop pulls Stanley's battered loaner right up behind him.
           
          Stanley flashes a last nervous smile at Tina, and digs for the 
          car hop's tip money... nothing.
           
          He shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in. 
          The car RATTLES, COUGHS the finally ROARS off in a cloud of 
          NOXIOUS 
          exhaust fumes.
           
          DISSOLVE TO:
           
          EXT. TAHOOCHIE BRIDGE - NIGHT
           
          A forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of Edge City. We can hear 
          Stanley's car SPUTTERING and POPPING along before it actually 
          pulls into 
          sight on the dark rain-slick street.
           
          INT. CAR
           
          Stanley drives along in a miserable daze. Suddenly the engine 
          starts KNOCKING violently and the car dies.
           
          EXT. BRIDGE
           
          Steam HISSES from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop. 
          Stanley GRINDS the ignition key again and again trying futilely 
          to restart the 
          engine.
           
          Finally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a 
          SQUEAL of metal, turns and kicks the bumper... which promptly 
          falls off with a 
          resounding CLUNK.
           
          Beat.
           
          The front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's 
          side door CLATTERS to the ground.
           
          Stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless 
          metal... his mind a complete blank.
           
          He slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water 
          swirling along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge. A wave of melancholy 
          sweeps over 
          him. Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it 
          drops down... down to the river below.
           
          Suddenly, something catches Stanley's eye... a BODY, floating 
          along in the darkness. He snaps back to reality.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Hey... Hey mister!
           
          EXT. RIVER BANK
           
          Stanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge. 
          He spots the body dead ahead, floating along in the moonlight and 
          HURRIES 
          as fast as he can.
           
          CAMERA DOLLIES with Stanley as he scrambles down the slope; a 
          black cat YOWLS as it races past him. He steps on and shatters a 
          discarded mirror, and he ducks under an old ladder that leans 
          against the bridge's foundation as he finally reaches the shore.
           
          Stanley splashes into the waist deep water just in time to catch 
          the body as it floats by.
           
          CLOSER - BODY
           
          As Stanley grabs it, the "body" falls to pieces... revealing that 
          it's nothing but a trash bag, an old tire and some floating bits 
          of garbage all 
          clinging to the "head": an old wooden Mask.
           
          Stanley shakes his head in disgust... some lifesaver.
           
          Stanley inspects the Mask more closely; strange ritualistic 
          symbols carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and eerie 
          empty eye holes.
           
          The faintest sound of a haunting "Mask SFX Theme" rises as 
          Stanley turns the Mask around and inspects the inside... slowly 
          bringing it 
          closer and closer to his face. The surface of the Mask begins to 
          SHIMMER.
           
          But then... RIBET! A frog jumps out of it, right into Stanley's 
          face. Stanley nearly loses his footing on the slippery river 
          bottom.
           
          Suddenly a blinding SPOTLIGHT shines down from the bridge and an 
          amplified voice calls out from a squad car.
           
          POLICEMAN
          Hey, you! What are you doing down
          there?
           
          Stanley squints into the light, trying to think of a reasonable 
          answer.
           
          STANLEY
          I was just looking for...
          (holds up Mask)
          My mask.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. MONKEY'S PAW - NIGHT
           
          The club is closing up. WAITERS stack chairs on top of tables in 
          the B.G. as Tina gathers her sheet music from her PIANIST.
           
          TINA
          Thanks Reno, you're the greatest.
           
          RENO
          G'night, doll.
           
          Tina crosses to the bar area where Dorian lounges with DR. 
          FREEZE, SWEET EDDY and CHUN WOO. Dorian toasts her as she pulls 
          up a bar 
          stool.
           
          DORIAN
          That was a great performance,
          baby. But not as great as the
          one you pulled off at the bank.
           
          TINA
          Yeah, well don't get used to it.
          I'm not going to start running
          cons for you again, Dorian. I'm
          a singer now and that's it.
           
          Dorian rolls his eyes at Freeze, "Get her".
           
          DORIAN
          Oh, really? And you had such a
          red hot career before you latched
          on to me?
           
          Tina pours herself a drink.
           
          TINA
          Who latched on to who?
           
          DORIAN
          Get real, Tina. You'll do what
          I say or I'll drop you back where
          I found you, slingin' hash and
          dodgin' horny peterbuilt drivers.
           
          TINA
          (downs a shot)
          Don't push me, Nicky. I might
          just take a walk I should have
          taken a long time ago.
           
          DORIAN
          (CHUCKLES)
          Easy, baby. Easy.
          (to his men)
          I love it when she gets pissed.
           
          Dorian scoots over and puts an arm around Tina. She remains cool.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          C'mere. You take a hike and who's
          gonna kiss you like Dorian Tyrel.
           
          Tina pours another shot.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          C'mon. Who?
           
          Tina finally cracks a smile.
           
          TINA
          Nobody.
           
          DORIAN
          (pulls her close)
          That's right, baby. C'mere.
           
          Tina slowly leans in for a kiss, her lips softly parted... but 
          raises a finger to Dorian's lips, stopping him cold. She glances 
          over at Freeze.
           
          TINA
          Sorry. I never get personal in
          front of the help.
           
          Tina abruptly stands and exits as Freeze glares at her.
           
          Dorian breaks into laughter.
           
          DORIAN
          That broad kills me.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          She just might, man. The bitch
          is trouble.
           
          Dorian pours them all a drink.
           
          DORIAN
          C'mon Doctor, lighten up.
          (raises his glass)
          Here's to Edge City Bank.
          May it crack like an egg on Easter
          Sunday.
           
          Their glasses CLINK.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
           
          The police car pulls up in front of Stanley's brownstone and he 
          wearily climbs out.
           
          OFFICER
          Okay, Mr. Ipkiss. Try to be a
          little more careful next time.
           
          STANLEY
          Thanks Officer.
           
          The black and white pulls away and Stanley starts across the 
          empty street.
           
          VOICE
          Hey, mister...
           
          Stanley turns.
           
          A razor-cut DEATH'S HEAD PUNKER hops down from a fire escape in a 
          darkened alleyway.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          You a cop or something?
           
          A half dozen other DEATH'S HEADS appear out of the shadows all 
          decked out in nipple chains, tattoos and other self-mutilation-
          AS-FASHION 
          oddments.
           
          STANLEY
          Uh... no. They just gave me a
          lift.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          A cop chauffeur? I never seen
          that before. How about you boys?
           
          The other Death's Heads pipe up with "Not Me," "Nope," "Pretty 
          special," etc. as they slowly surround Stanley.
           
          STANLEY
          Alright, you guys. It's been a
          tough night. I haven't got any
          money. I haven't got a car. All
          I have is this and you're
          welcome to it.
           
          Stanley tosses Death's Head #1 the Mask.
           
          He briefly inspects the funky looking antique, still slick with 
          river slime, then tosses it back. He approaches Stanley.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          Hey, man. You got us all wrong.
          We don't want any trouble. I was
          just going to ask you for the
          time. That's all. You got the
          time?
           
          STANLEY
          Uh... yeah.
           
          As Stanley pulls back his sleeve to check his watch, the Death's 
          Head flicks out a butterfly knife. With a FLASH of steel, he 
          slices straight 
          through Stanley's watch band and snatches the watch.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          (holding up his prize)
          See, I only wanted the time! Heh,
          he, heh...
           
          All the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Death's Head 
          #1 shoves Stanley into Death's Head #2. #2 pushes him back across 
          to #3 and 
          so on. Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more 
          violently within the circle of giggling street toughs. He finally 
          breaks free and 
          scrambles to his front door, still reeling with dizziness. He 
          fumbles with the key and SLAMS the door behind him as the Death's 
          Heads roar with 
          laughter.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
           
          Stanley's wet shoes SQUEAK as he tiptoes past -
           
          APARTMENT "A" - MANAGER
           
          A sign that reads "Quiet Please" hangs from the doorknob. Stanley 
          continues past it to Apartment "B". Just as he removes his keys - 
          THE 
          Manager's door flies open and MRS. PEENMAN appears. She's an old 
          dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just to 
          spite her 
          relatives.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what
          time it is?
           
          Reflexively, he looks at his (now empty) wrist.
           
          STANLEY
          Actually, no.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          It's three o'clock in the morning!
          First, you wake up the entire
          building laughing it up with your
          pals. Then, you come in and start
          squeak -
          (sees puddles)
          My new carpet! Just look at that!
          This is coming out of your
          cleaning deposit Ipkiss!
           
          Stanley, battered, bruised and soaking wet is deep in urban 
          shell-shock.
           
          STANLEY
          (SOFTLY)
          Are you done?
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          ...Yes.
           
          STANLEY
          I think I'll be going to bed now.
           
          Mrs. Peenman SLAMS her door.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUES
           
          Small, full of books but very neat. A few cherished animation 
          cels from 1940s cartoons are framed on the wall. As Stanley locks 
          the door behind 
          him - he's greeted by MILO, a happy little terrie sized mutt with 
          a big heart.
           
          STANLEY
          Hello, Milo.
           
          Milo gets so excited he starts GAGGING and COUGHING.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Easy, buddy. I missed you too.
           
          Stanley pats Milo on the rump, crosses his tiny kitchenette and 
          heads straight into...
           
          THE BEDROOM
           
          Stanley's prized collection of "golden Age" Looney Tunes tapes 
          are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf.
           
          He tosses the Mask down on his bedside table, pops one of his 
          cherished Tex Avery cartoons into the V.C.R., plops down on his 
          bed and 
          starts to strip off his shoes and socks.
           
          MILO
           
          enters, holding a Frisbee in his mouth.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          C'mon, Milo. I'm beat.
          (to the dog YIPS)
          Okay, okay. One throw.
           
          Stanley tosses the Frisbee into the air. The disk sails...
           
          OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY
           
          Milo runs it down, leaps up, and makes a perfect catch. He trots 
          back to the bedroom, and drops it in Stanley's lap.
           
          STANLEY
          Easy. This is the best part.
           
          On the screen a cartoon dog ZZZIPS into frame and drops a 
          frizzing stick of dynamite down a bad guy's pants. KA-BOOM! The 
          dog LAUGHS 
          maniacally.
           
          Suddenly there is a POUNDING on the wall that rattles Stanley's 
          framed cartoon cels.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          (calls out)
          Sorry Mrs. Peenman.
           
          With a sigh, he ejects the tape and a much quieter talk show POPS 
          on. Larry King and a guest.
           
          Stanley rises and crosses into the bathroom to wash up.
           
          ANGLE ON T.V.
           
          King's guest, Dr. Arthur Neuman, is replying to a caller.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          That's correct. The truth is we
          all wear masks, metaphorically
          speaking. We repress the Id...
          our darkest desires and hide
          behind a more socially acceptable
          image of ourselves in order to
          cope with the frustrations of our
          day to day lives.
           
          Stanley's only half listening though the open bathroom door as he 
          brushes his teeth.
           
          STANLEY
          Think I'm repressed, Milo?
           
          Stanley tries a couple of fierce expressions in the bathroom 
          mirror, his mouth foaming with toothpaste.
           
          Milo does that doggie-head-cocked-sideways "What the hell?" look.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          (HALF-HEARTEDLY)
          Nah.
           
          He spits and rinses.
           
          ANGLE ON T.V.
           
          as King wraps it up, displaying the doctor's book.
           
          LARRY KING
          The book is "The Masks We Wear,"
          by Dr. Arthur Neuman. Thank you
          Dr. Neuman.
           
          Stanley pops off the T.V.with his remote.
           
          STANLEY
          No thank you, Dr. Neuman.
           
          As he buttons up his P.J.s, Stanley notices Milo warily sniffing 
          at the strange Mask, which is still lying on the bedside table. A 
          SUBTLE 
          SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly hops off 
          the bed.
           
          We now begin to hear the "Mask Theme"... echoes of the POUNDING 
          Viking drums... growing louder. Haunting whispery VOICES seem to 
          call to Stanley as he slowly crosses to the bedside. He picks up 
          the Mask and turns it over in his hands running his fingers 
          across the time 
          work wood. The music builds...
           
          He turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the Mask 
          to his face. Milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed.
           
          For an instant - the MASK SHRINK WRAPS like a vacuum over 
          Stanley's head. We hear the PIERCING MASK SFX.
           
          Then, a beat later, the Mask is off with a POP. The SFX STOP.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Whoa.
           
          Stanley studies the old mask, then his own face in the mirror. 
          Everything's status quo. It must have been his imagination.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Naw...
           
          He puts the Mask on again - firmly this time. Milo dives under 
          the bed as...
           
          AN INCREDIBLE METAMORPHOSIS BEGINS:
           
          RUBBERY WOODEN WHIPS shoot out of the Mask and wrap around 
          Stanley's head - locking the Mask in place.
           
          STANLEY'S PAJAMAS magically reweave themselves... growing in all 
          directions.
           
          HIS HEAD THROBS AND EXPANDS, turning lime green as it unites with 
          the Mask.
           
          STANLEY GRABS HIS HEAD - His body begins to move uncontrollably.
           
          Spinning faster and faster like a gyroscope. The SFX get loonier 
          and loonier as he becomes...
           
          A HUMAN TORNADO. Stanley's words are almost unintelligible as his 
          voice jumps one, two, five octaves.
           
          STANLEY
          Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee...
           
          A HAND reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost. The 
          whirlwind SCREECHES to a halt, causing sparks and smoke to rise 
          FROM 
          the singed carpet. The smoke clears revealing...
           
          THE MASK CREATURE
           
          He's dressed in a snazzy zoot suit - a distortion of the paisley 
          material of Stanley's pajamas.
           
          The head is no longer Stanley's. It's large, bald and bright 
          green. The huge bug-eyes glow with mischief. The nose is small, 
          bony and beaked. 
          The mouth and teeth are enormous and gleaming white as he breaks 
          into a learning grin.
           
          The overall effect is devilishly loony, but not altogether 
          unhuman. In fact, there's something downright charming about him.
           
          The Mask checks himself out in the mirror and likes what he sees.
           
          THE MASK
          S-s-s-nazzy!
           
          He SNAPS his bow tie with a crazy gleam in his eyes.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          It's party time!
           
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
           
          Trying to ber VERY, VERY quiet, the Mask tiptoes down the 
          darkened corridor. The floor makes a barely audible CREEEEK as 
          the Mask steps 
          with exaggerated care pst APARTMENT "A" with it's little "Quiet 
          Please" sign. He raises a finger to his lip, making the "SHUSH" 
          sign.
           
          Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps out of 
          Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          O, jeepers--!
           
          Stanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every 
          time. Frustrated, he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from his 
          pocket and 
          starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock. 
          Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but 
          those bells just keep 
          ringing.
           
          The hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers 
          into the floor and reverberates through the building like 
          THUNDERBOLTS.
           
          The door bursts open and Mrs. Peenman's angry face pops out 
          covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers. She gets one look 
          at the Mask 
          with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and 
          SCREAMS bloody murder.
           
          The Mask SCREAMS in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and 
          his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror.
           
          Mrs. Peenman's door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as she 
          appears cocking an enormous shotgun.
           
          MASK
          Easy lady! I was just killin'
          time!
           
          The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal 
          laughter as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM.
           
          The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs. Peenman continues to blast 
          away, and finally leaps straight out the window. KEE-RASH.
           
          EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
           
          Sending his body SAILING our through the air towards the street 
          seven stories below.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-
           
          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
           
          SPLAT. Stanley/Mask lands face up in the middle of the street. He 
          slow... painfully starts to rise as a STREET CLEANING machine 
          turns a 
          corner and RUNS DIRECTLY OVER HIM. The machine disappears down 
          the street as we HOLD on Stanley/Mask's flattened body.
           
          He raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself 
          off the street. He shakes himself out with one sharp CRACK and 
          straightens his 
          zoot suit. He's shocked to find a tiny SPOT on his sleeve.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          Hey! You missed a spot!
           
          As if on cue, a SECOND street cleaning machine SLAMS into him and 
          RUNS OVER HIM AGAIN. This time he reinflates himself back into 3-
          D 
          by blowing into his thumb and hops up.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          And next time, no starch!
           
          Fully recovered, Stanley/Mask starts down the street, strutting 
          like a prize fighter.
           
          VOICE
          Hey mister...
           
          Death's Head punker #1 hops down from his fire esscape behind the 
          Mask.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD #1
          (grins evilly)
          ...You got the time?
           
          The Mask turns to see he is surrounded by the Death's Head 
          punkers. He seems to be delighted by their presence, but now that 
          they see his 
          face, they're totally freaked.
           
          MASK
          (wiggles eyebrows)
          Why of course, Cubbie. I got all
          the time in the world!
           
          He whips out his forearm (which grows large for emphasis cartoon-
          style). It's covered with crazily spinning watches, CHIMING 
          cuckoo clocks 
          and sun dials.
           
          MASK
          London, Paris, Rome, standard,
          substandard and no standards at
          all! And for our English friends
          we have... Big Ben!
           
          DEATH'S HEAD #1
          Big Ben?
           
           
          Stanley/Mask KICKS a nearby street post, snapping it in half and 
          sending a large decorative street clock PLUMMETING into the 
          sidewalk. 
          KA-BONG! It completely obliterates Death's Head #1. The other 
          gang members jump back in shock as the Mask races around the 
          corner.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD #2
          Get him!
           
          The Death's Heads pull out nasty homemade weapons and race around 
          the corner into the alleyway.
           
          INT. ALLEY
           
          They come to a screeching halt as they discover Stanley/Mask 
          dressed as a carnival barker. Multicolored lights and Calliope 
          music come from 
          out of nowhere.
           
          MASK
          And for my next trick...
           
          Long pink and blue balloons appear in Stanley/Mask's hands and he 
          instantly goes into a frenzy of twisting and knotting them into 
          AN 
          elaborate balloon sculpture. SQUEAK. SQUEAK. SCREECH.
           
          The Death's Heads are too stunned by the severe weirdness of all 
          this to do anything but stand there and stare. (These guys were 
          no rocket 
          scientists in the first place.)
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          And viola! We have a giraffe!
           
          Sure enough, he's created a first rate balloon sculpture. He 
          hands it to the biggest, dumbest Death's Head, who grins like a 
          little kid upon 
          receiving it.
           
          The Mask instantly goes into another flurry of motion, sculpting 
          more balloons. SCREECH POP.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          A few more twists of the wrist
          and for you, Cubbie.
           
          He hands this next prize to Death's Head #3.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          A French poodle! And finally my
          favorite...
           
          He goes into another flurry of motion.
           
          E.C.U. - BALLOON
           
          As the Mask pulls the ends of the knotted balloon, it straightens 
          out and MORPHS into...
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          A Tommy gun!
           
          A real one! He immediately sprays the Death's Heads with hot 
          lead. RATATATATATAT!
           
          The greasy punkers dive for cover and scramble out of the alley 
          under a hail of bullets.
           
          Stanley/Mask tosses the gun aside, intoxicated with his newfound 
          powers.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          Wait a minute. This is
          incredible! Why, with these
          powers I could be a superhero!
          I could fight crime... Work for
          world peace...
           
          C.U. - THE MASK

          EXT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - NIGHT
           
          It's late, but there's still a light on inside.
           
          INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
           
          Burt and Irv, both woozy from drink, attempt to finish a card 
          game. A dozen empty beer bottles and two half eaten chili dogs 
          adorn the table.
           
          Irv takes a big bite of his chili dog and pauses to regard it 
          like a true connoisseur.
           
          IRV
          Now these are serious chili dogs.
           
          BURT
          I know. Here's the proof...
          (lets out a long BUUURP)
          Aaah. Even tastier the second
          time around.
           
          Irv leans forward and sticks out his index finger.
           
          IRV
          Hey Burt, pull on my finger.
           
          BURT
          No way, man.
           
          IRV
          No, really. Go ahead.
           
          BURT
          Irv, don't...
           
          Irv raises a leg anyway and rips off a nasty fart. BRAAAP!
           
          IRV
          (PROUDLY)
          That, my friend is the sweet smell
          of success.
           
          BURT
          (SHRUGS)
          No style. I give it a five tops.
           
          IRV
          Okay, how about... Soprano.
           
          Irv shifts his weight and hits an amazing high note. PWEEEEEP! 
          Burt is impressed in spite of himself.
           
          BURT
          Fine muscle control.
           
          IRV
          And now for my grand finale,
          THX... The audience is listening!
           
          Irv lets one loose in perfect sensurround.
           
          Suddenly the front door EXPLODES inward. Stanley/Mask stands 
          there SILHOUETTED like a gunfighter from a Clint Eastwood movie.
           
          Irv squints into the light, unable to make out the mysterious 
          figure.
           
          IRV
          Hey, 40 watt... we're closed!
          Nobody's here.
           
          MASK
          Ah... but you're here.
           
          Irv rises.
           
          IRV
          What I mean is...
           
          He lets loose a sneaker to help make his point. POOOOT.
           
          IRV
          Nobody's here that wants to
          help you.
           
          Stanley/Mask now steps into the light.
           
          MASK
          But I'm here to help you.
           
          Burt and Irv's eyes go wide as they get a better look at their 
          nemesis. Fear loosens Irv's sphincter and a last feeble bit of 
          gas escapes with a 
          FWEEP!
           
          Stanley/Mask whirls about with a flourish and pulls two gleaming 
          mufflers from the wall.
           
          MASK
          Sounds like you have a little
          exhaust problem there!
           
          There's a mad gleam in his eyes as he spins the mufflers like two 
          huge pistols and SNAPS them to a halt.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          We better do a few touch ups
          before you have some serious
          trouble.
           
          The Mask TWIRLS out of frame like a human tornado.
           
          Camera PUSHES IN past Burt and Irv's shocked expressions into an 
          E.C.U. of the garage's bare light bulb as it JIGGLES on its wire. 
          We can't see the mayhem, but we can hear wacky/bizarre sound F.X. 
          as the Mask whirls about the garage. WHIZ! SCREECH! BANG! AHOOGA!
           
          BURT AND IRV
          No!... Wait! Eeeeeyaah!
           
          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
           
          As that light bulb becomes the morning SUN peaking over Edge 
          City's skyline. CAMERA PULLS BACK through Stanley's bedroom 
          window...
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN
           
          Stanley slowly awakens. He grabs his head and moans, looking and 
          feeling completely hung over. Then suddenly he remembers - and 
          JUMPS 
          out of bed with a start.
           
          He looks in the mirror, touching his face. It's the same old 
          Stanley. He looks at his paisley PJ's. Same old PJ's.
           
          He picks up the mask. Same old mask.
           
          STANLEY
          A dream... It was only a dream.
           
          Stanley starts to relax. There's a KNOCK at the door.
           
          INT. HALLWAY - DAWN
           
          Stanley's greeted by LT. KELLAWAY (50). This hound-dog of a cop 
          can't help but stare at Stanley's garish pajamas.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Nice PJ's pal.
           
          STANLEY
          Can I help you?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          You're Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss?
           
          STANLEY
          That's right.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Some kind of prowler broke in and
          attacked Mrs. Peenman.
           
          STANLEY
          (swallows hard)
          Really? I didn't hear a thing.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Then you must be a pretty sound
          sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she
          unloaded a couple rounds of 20
          ott buckshot five feet from your
          door.
           
          Kellaway swings Stanley's door open wider to give him a better 
          view of the damage. Mrs. Peenman stands there in the hall 
          tearfully speaking to 
          anither OFFICER.
           
          Stanley is flabbergasted to see:
           
          QUICK CUTS
           
          C.U. - The shotgun blasts in the walls.
           
          C.U. - The pot holes left from the mallet.
           
          C.U. - The shattered remains of the wacky alarm clock.
           
          All flashbacks from last night!
           
          STANLEY
          (GASPS)
          That's... impossible!
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Excuse me?
           
          Stanley quickly pulls himself together.
           
          STANLEY
          That's... a, possible. See, I
          have this inner ear problem.
          (wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously)
          Sometimes I can't hear a thing.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SKEPTICAL)
          Is that a fact?
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          Kellaway leans closer to speak more loudly, but catches himself 
          and shoots Stanley a dirty look.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Forget it.
           
          He hands Stanley his card.
           
          KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Here. You remember anything
          unusual about last night, anything
          at all, call me.
           
          STANLEY
          Sure... thanks.
           
          Stanley SLAMS the door and throws his body against it, his heart 
          pounding in his chest. Milo gives him that curious 
          dog-head-cocked-sideways look.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Milo, it was real! How could it
          all be... real?
           
          Stanley suddenly notices the clock on the wall.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Oh my god. I'm late!
           
          He races into the bedroom.
           
          INT. HALLWAY
           
          Kellaway is taking notes as patiently as he can from Mrs. 
          Peenman.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta
          admit your description is pretty
          tough to swallow.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Then you can choke on it for all
          I care. I saw what I saw.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Right.
          (refers to notes)
          A green head the size of a
          pumpkin, purple zoot suit and
          spats. That's a pretty serious
          fashion risk for any
          self-respecting second story man.
           
          An OFFICER now hurries up the steps all out of breath.
           
          OFFICER
          Lt., we just got an emergency call
          from a mechanic on 67th Street.
           
          KELLAWAY
          What?
           
          POLICEMAN
          Some kind of assault and battery.
          Sound pretty bad.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SIGHS)
          Alright. Dont' worry Mrs.
          Peenman, we'll find this guy for
          you. Officer Deluca here has a
          few forms you'll have to fill out.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT
           
          Stanley rushes around the apartment, but he can't find his keys 
          anywhere. He finishes tying his tie as he searches.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo! Keys! Keys!
           
          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
           
          Milo's ears prick. He leaps up and immediately starts sniffing 
          around. He pulls a cushion off the sofa and emerges with the keys 
          just as Stanley 
          comes out, briefcaase in hand.
           
          STANLEY
          Good boy.
           
          He pets his dog, takes his keys and starts out the door... but he 
          pauses to take a last look at the mask... It's eerie black eye 
          holes and devilish 
          grin seem to mock him.
           
          On sudden impulse, he grabs it, hurls it out the balcony's 
          sliding glass door and exits.
           
          SLOW-MO - THE MASK
           
          Sailing end over end through the air.
           
          EXT. BUILDING
           
          As the mask flies out into the sir, a sudden wind kicks up.
           
          The mask arcs back toward the building like a boomerang and lands 
          balanced precariously on a narrow ledge. Its mocking grin seems 
          to glow 
          with triumph.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - DAY
           
          The place looks like it's been hit by cartoon graffiti 
          guerrillas: Everything's printed in polka-dots, checks, tartan, 
          etc. The 
          "Ripley Auto Finishing" sign hangs askew over the doorway. 
          Letters have been sprayed out to read "Rip Off!"
           
          Several REPORTERS and curious ONLOOKERS stand nearby as Kellaway 
          and his men take it all in. PARAMEDICS appear wheeling Burt and 
          Irv out of the building on two gurneys.
           
          They're both in severe discomfort and look more like cars than 
          men: Bodies spray painted metallic colors, hood ornaments glued 
          to their 
          foreheads, wire rims under each limb, and gleaming four foot long 
          mufflers sticking out of their rear ends.
           
          They wince in pain at each tiny bump of the gurney.
           
          BURT AND IRV
          Ah!... Eeeh!... Ooh!
           
          Paramedic #3 speaks into his emergency radio-phone as Burt and 
          Irv are loaded into the van.
           
          PARAMEDIC #3
          I want a proctologist standing
          by! Yeah, you heard me! The best
          one you can find.
           
          An OFFICER steps out of the building and approaches Kellaway.
           
          OFFICER
          We were able to get a description
          Lt., but it's pretty weird.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SIGHS)
          Let me guess... Big green head.
          Zoot suit.
           
          OFFICER
          How did you...
           
          KELLWAY
          Whoever this guy is, he's a world
          class twisto.
           
          PEGGY BRANDT, an attractive young woman in her mid twenties, 
          appears besides the other reporters and approaches Kellaway, 
          notepad in 
          hand.
           
          PEGGY
          Excuse me, Lt., I'm with the
          Evening Star. Can you tell me
          what happened here?
           
          KELLAWAY
          Sorry. Too early to comment.
           
          PEGGY
          It looks like some kind of mob
          scare tactic.
           
          KELLAWAY
          I said no comment. Now break it
          up. This is a crime scene.
           
          As the officers disperse the reporters and other onlookers, Peggy 
          slips away from the group. Even though it's closed off with 
          yellow police 
          tape, Peggy slips inside the garage.
           
          INT. MECHANIC'S OFFICE - DAY
           
          The empty garage has been turned into a topsy-turvy nightmare. 
          The same cartoon paint job covers the walls. Peggy looks around, 
          SIFTING 
          through some papers scattered all over the floor. Nothing.
           
          Then she spies the COMPLAINT BOX. Peggy opens it and pulls out a 
          HANDFUL of pink "comment" slips. She looks at them. Almost all of 
          them are from one customer - STANLEY IPKISS.
           
          INT. BANK - DAY
           
          Stanley, still looking rumpled and unshaven, hurriedly takes off 
          his coat and powers up his computer. Charlie steps over to his 
          desk carrying a 
          newspaper.
           
          CHARLIE
          What happened to you last night?
          The girls and I were looking all
          over for you.
           
          STANLEY
          I uh, didn't feel so good. I
          decided to go home early.
           
          CHARLIE
          As a matter of fact, you don't
          look so good. You got to take
          better care of yourself, man.
           
          STANLEY
          How was the club?
           
          CHARLIE
          Are you kidding? It was hotter
          than a pistol. Did you see the
          paper?
           
          STANLEY
          No.
           
          CHARLIE
          Your girlfriend got a great
          review.
           
          Chralie flips open the Entertainment section of the Evening Star. 
          There's a great close-up of Tina singing her heart out with the 
          HEADLINE 
          "Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey's Paw."
           
          MR. DICKEY, the smarmy office manager who is younger than 
          Stanley, now appears.
           
          DICKEY
          Ipkiss! You're forty minutes
          late! Every time you do that
          you're robbing this bank of its
          time and money!
           
          STANLEY
          Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won't
          happen again.
           
          DICKEY
          (snatches newspaper)
          If you weren't so busy ogling
          girlie pictures you'd get some
          work done around here.
           
          CHARLIE
          Ah... She's a prospective client
          of Stanley's, sir.
           
          DICKEY
          (sudden attitude change)
          She is? Well... Next time she
          comes in see that you send her
          directly to my office.
           
          STANLEY
          Yes sir, Mr. Dickey.
           
          Dickey tosses the paper back on Stanley's desk and marches off 
          through the bank.
           
          CHARLIE
          Look at that little creep. If
          it wasn't for his daddy he'd be
          out somewhere shakin' down school
          kids for lunch money.
           
          Stanley toys with the Kleenex that bears Tina's lipstick "kiss".
           
          STANLEY
          You think she ever will come back,
          Charlie?
           
          CHARLIE
          Who knows? Forget about her,
          Stanley. A dame like that is
          always looking for the B.B.D.
          The bigger better deal. Ask her
          what her sign is and she'll say
          dollar.
           
          STANLEY
          You don't know that. She's an
          artist. Maybe she's sensitive.
           
          CHARLIE
          Yeah. She can sense a guy's
          credit line at two hundred yards.
          Stanley, you need a girl you can
          depend on. Someone a little more
          down to earth... someone like...
           
          ANGLE ACROSS THE BANK
           
          as Peggy Brandt stops by a teller's window, looking sharp and 
          pretty in a blazer and jeans.
           
          PEGGY
          Excuse me, can you tell me where
          I can find Stanley Ipkiss?
           
          BACK TO CHARLIE
           
          CHARLIE
          Like her! Someone like her.
          (straightens tie)
          As a matter of fact I could use
          someone like her myself.
          (rises as Peggy approaches)
          Hel-lo there. May I be of some
          assistance?
           
          PEGGY
          Stanley Ipkiss?
           
          Charlie begrudgingly points to Stanley.
           
          PEGGY (CONT.)
          Hi. I'm Peggy Brandt. I'm with
          the Evening Star.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, hi. I already have a
          subscription, thanks.
           
          PEGGY
          Oh no, actually I just wanted to
          ask you a few questions.
           
          STANLEY
          Really? About what?
           
          PEGGY
          Ripley Auto Finishing. You're
          a customer of theirs aren't you?
           
          STANLEY
          I... uh. No. I think you must
          have made a mistake.
           
          Peggy produces one of the complaint slips.
           
          PEGGY
          Isn't this a form of theirs you
          filled out?
           
          STANLEY
          (nervous chuckle)
          Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess
          I have stopped in there once or
          twice, Miss... what did you say
          your name was?
           
          PEGGY
          Peggy Brandt.
           
          STANLEY
          Wait a minute... Peggy Brandt of
          "Ask Peggy"?
           
          PEGGY
          That's right.
           
          STANLEY
          (brightens up)
          You printed my letter last year,
          remember? "Nice Guys Finish
          Last."
           
          PEGGY
          You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do
          you realize how much mail we got
          about that letter? There's
          hundreds of women out there who
          are looking for a man just like
          you.
           
          STANLEY
          Are you serious?
           
          PEGGY
          Of course. DO you know how hard
          it is to find a decent man in this
          town? Most of them think monogamy
          is some kind of wood.
           
          STANLEY
          Why are you covering this story?
           
          PEGGY
          They cut my salary. I just can't
          make it by on "Dear Peggy"
          anymore. The truth is, I want
          to be a real reporter and if I
          can break this story I know
          they'll let me.
          (sits closer)
          Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto
          is a crooked operation. They may
          even have had ties to the Mob.
          I'm not out to get you. I just
          want the truth.
           
          STANLEY
          I wish I knew the truth, Peggy.
          I really do.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. MONKEY'S PAW ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON
           
          A well dressed MAN checks from beneath his sunglasses to see 
          nobody's watching and RAPS on the door. It opens and he quickly 
          DISAPPEARS 
          inside.
           
          INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE
           
          Sweet Eddy escorts him inside. The man removes his glasses and 
          glances about nervously. Dorian sits at his desk. Dr. Freeze and 
          Chun Woo 
          are going over an array of high tech burglary equipment laid out 
          on the air hockey table.
           
          DORIAN
          Good afternoon, Councilman Snell.
          Nice of you to drop by.
           
          SNELL
          Cut the crap. Dorian. What's so
          important that I had to come here
          in person?
           
          Dorian gazes out the window to the Valhalla Casino.
           
          DORIAN
          I got a little job for you, Tom.
          I want you to pull the Swede's
          gambling license.
           
          SNELL
          That's impossible. He was
          approved six months ago.
           
          DORIAN
          Pull a few strings. Find
          something in the fine print. I
          don't care how you do it, but do
          it. You owe me.
           
          SNELL
          (CHUCKLES)
          I owe you nothing, you little
          piece of shit. I got your
          liquor license when nobody else
          would touch...
           
          Dorian suddenly EXPLODES, overturning his desk and sending Snell 
          tumbling backwards. In less than a heartbeat, he grabs Snell by 
          his shirt 
          ffront, SLAMS him up against the wall, SMASHES a whiskey bottle 
          and presses the jagged edge to his throat.
           
          Snell hangs there whimpering. Dorian has a crazed look in his 
          eyes as he gazes at the Councilman's lapel.
           
          DORIAN
          (SOFTLY)
          That's pretty. What is that, a
          carnation?
           
          Snell nods. Dorian takes a deep whiff.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Nice. Hey, Eddy... call my
          florist. Two dozen pink
          carnations to Mrs. Snell with my
          regrets over her husband's
          untimely accident.
           
          Tears begin to well up in Snell's eyes.
           
          SNELL
          (GASPING)
          No... please. I can do it. I
          can make it happen.
           
          Dorian eases back... brushes off Snell's coat.
           
          DORIAN
          That's smart. You're a very smart
          man. Now pull yourself together.
          Look at you.
           
          Dorian picks up an Uzi from Dr. Freeze's equipment.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Shut the Swede down, Snell. We'll
          buy him out cheap with a little
          collateral the bank is about to
          provide us.
          (looks at his men)
          And Gentlemen... we are going to
          be in the casino business.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. STANLEY'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
           
          Distant sirens can be heard over the occasional sound of a 
          gunshot. It's a reasonably peaceful night in Edge City.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
           
          CAMERA SLOWLY PANS off of Tina's picture, which is now taped to 
          Stanley's dresser mirror... to Stanley himself as he tosses and 
          turns in a 
          fitful sleep. Milo lies curled up at the foot of the bed. He 
          looks concerned over the little noises Stanley is making in his 
          sleep.
           
          CAMERA PUSHES INTO AN E.C.U. of Stanley as we
           
          DISSOLVE THROUGH INTO:
           
          STANLEY'S DREAM - a 1940s noir-style montage:
           
          Huge soft-lit faces loom over him, one dissolving into the 
          next... Tina, luminous and breathtaking speaks under heavily 
          lidded eyes.
           
          TINA
          Or it could be two lovers.
          That would be the woman on top,
          of course...
           
          Charlie looms up out of the darkness.
           
          CHARLIE
          Forget her, Stanley. Ask her what
          her sign is and she'll say dollar.
           
          Mr. Dickey appears, glaring down angrily at Stanley.
           
          DICKEY
          Every time you're late Ipkiss,
          you're robbing this bank!
           
          The shrink from the "larry King Show" floats by on a cloud of 
          pipe smoke.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          We must repress our Id... our
          deepest darkest desires.
           
          Finally Tina again standing beside the limo as she was that night 
          in the Monkey's Paw alley:
           
          TINA
          Hey, are you okay.
           
          Stanley stands at the curb, but this time he's not splattered 
          with mud. He's decked out in first class Armani and looks suave 
          as hell. He looks 
          straight into her eyes.
           
          STANLEY
          I am now. C'mere, baby.
           
          TINA
          (SWOONS)
          Oh, Stanley!
           
          She runs to his arms and they embrace in a passionate kiss. But 
          Tina suddenly pulls back and begins rapidly licking Stanley's 
          ear... which is 
          kinda weird.
           
          E.C.U. - STANLEY
           
          STANLEY
          Tina?
           
          Stanley suddenly realizes Milo is licking his ear... and he's 
          just woken up.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Milo, down.
           
          He pushes Milo away, tosses back the covers and rises out of bed. 
          It's still the dead of night and Stanley is all in a huff from 
          his dream.
           
          He spots Tina's clipping on his dresser mirror and rips it off, 
          upset with himself.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Stupid, stupid. She'd never...
           
          Stanley wheels about and to his complete surprise sees...
           
          THE MASK
           
          Through his bedroom window, propped up on the fourth story ledge. 
          Its leering grin seems to beckon Stanley as we begin to hear the 
          POUNDING beat of the Mask F.X. theme.
           
          STANLEY
           
          stands transfixed, staring at the moonlit face. He can almost 
          hear echos of faint whispered VOICES calling his name. A deadly 
          siren song above 
          the pounding drums.
           
          STANLEY
          (SOFTLY)
          No...
           
          He backs away from the window.
           
          E.C.U. - THE MASK
           
          shimmers as the WHISPERS grow louder.
           
          STANLEY
           
          takes a last look at the crumpled picture of Tina in his hand and 
          finally loses control. He bolts from the room.
           
          EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
           
          Stanley is a driven man as he makes his way out onto the narrow 
          ledge. Milo tugs at his pajama leg, but Stanley kicks him away 
          and climbs out 
          over the ledge.
           
          THE LEDGE
           
          Stanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry, then 
          catches his balance. His face is bathed in sweat as he gazes at 
          the leering face. 
          F.X. music THUNDERS in his head.
           
          THE MASK
          (faint echos)
          Stanley... Stanley.
           
          Stanley tries to steady himself, his eyes transfixed on his 
          prize.
           
          STANLEY
          Just... one... last... time.
           
          He lurches back out and makes his way one shaky step at a time 
          towards the mask.
           
          MILO
           
          watches from the apratment window, whimpering softly.
           
          C.U. - THE LEDGE
           
          Narrow masonry begins to crumble.
           
          STANLEY
           
          carefully reaches down, his fingers just brushing the mask as he 
          teeters out over nothingness. Night traffic whizzes by down 
          below.
           
          THE MASONRY
           
          cracks away.
           
          STANLEY
           
          SCREAMS as he begins to fall, jamming the mask to his face.
           
          INT. APARTMENT
           
          The window suddenly EXPLODES inwards as the whirling Stanley/Mask 
          tornado bursts into the room. Milo dives for cover.
           
          The tornado scorches the rug as it wheels around the room, then 
          SCREECHES to a halt, revealing the Mask in his full glory. He 
          strikes a grand 
          entrance pose with his arms held high.
           
          MASK
          (SINGS)
          I gotta be me! I just gotta be me!
           
          He ZZZIPS into the bathroom
           
          INT. BATHROOM
           
          The Mask sticks the picture of Tina on the bathroom mirror and 
          blows her a kiss.
           
          MASK
          (a'la Big Bopper)
          Oooooh Bay-bee. I knoooooows what
          you likah!
           
          He sprouts a couple of extra arms as he madly brushes his teeth, 
          sprays on cologne and bats himself with a powder puff all at 
          once.
           
          He ZZZIPS into the bedroom.
           
          INT. BEDROOM
           
          The Mask stands before a full length mirror and checks himself 
          out. With a magical "hands are quicker than the eye" move, he 
          CHANGES 
          wardrobe instantly... now posing in an effete fashion victim Don 
          Johnson-style suit.
           
          MASK
          The G.Q. look?... Naw.
           
          In a TWINKLING he's changed again: now in MTV Rapper-style over-
          sized jeans and backwards baseball cap.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          501's?
          (shakes his head)
          For buttonheads only.
           
          He changes again in a flash... This time he's naked except for 
          his Calvin Klein underwear (his stomach muscles appear super-cut 
          washboard-style).
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          Marky Mark, eat your heart out.
           
          He changes one last time and appears in a wild banana yellow zoot 
          suit complete with a snap brim fedora. That's the ticket!
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          S-s-s-mokin! Now let's see...
           
          The Mask quickly searches his pockets. He pulls his pants pockets 
          inside out and a moth flutters out.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          What? Seems to be a minor cash
          flow problem here! I don't like
          to keep a lady waiting, but...
          (points a finger in the air)
          First things first!
           
          The Mask ZZZIPS out of frame.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT EDGE CITY BANK - NIGHT
           
          The street is quiet and empty, except for a Dipsy Doodle Diaper 
          delivery van parked across from the bank.
           
          INT. TRUCK
           
          Crowded with Dorian's men, it's been set up as a makeshift 
          control room for the robbery. Dr. Freeze SLAPS a clip in his 9mm 
          and looks down 
          through the van's false bottom to Sweet Eddy, who is standing in 
          an open manhole working on a bundle of underground wiring.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          What's the E.T.A.?
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Another five minutes.
           
          Freeze synchronizes his watch.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Counting down... now.
           
          Freeze presses a button on the side of a miniaturized headset 
          he's wearing
           
          DR. FREEZE (CONT.)
          (into headset)
          Lookin' good here, my man.
           
          INTERCUT - DORIAN'S OFFICE
           
          He sits at his desk, speaking into a high tech walkie talkie. In 
          the B.G. Dorian's wall-mounted video monitors display live shots 
          of the club in full 
          swing.
           
          DORIAN
          Nice work, Freeze. You boy are
          on your own now. I've got to make
          sure I'm seen downstairs.
           
          DR. FREEZE (V.O.)
          Do it, man. The Doctah is about
          to operate.
           
          INT. VAN
           
          Freeze turns to his men.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Gentlemen...
          (cocks his gun)
          Let's do our duty and grab the
          booty.
           
          The burglars gather their gear when suddenly the bank alarm 
          starts RINGING.
           
          Freeze looks down the hole to Sweet Eddy.
           
          DR. FREEZE (CONT.)
          What the hell you doin', fool?
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Nothing! I didn't do nothing!
           
          FREEZE
          (to the others)
          C'mon! You keep that motor
          runnin'!
           
          EXT. BANK
           
          Freeze and company race across the street with guns drawn.
           
          ANGLE ON THE BANK DOORS
           
          Freeze and Chun Woo flatten themselves on either side of the door 
          as Burglar #4 drops to one knee and quickly picks the lock.
           
          Suddenly the glass doors EXPLODE wide open as a HUMAN WHIRLWIND 
          bursts out of the bank, shoots right past them and zig-zags up 
          THE 
          street. Twenty dollar bills slowly drift down onto the stunned 
          robbers in its wake.
           
          In an instant the whirlwind does a U-turn, zig-zag races back up 
          to them and SCREECHES to a halt. The Mask, still in his banana 
          yellow zoot suit 
          and carrying huge sacks of money like Santa Claus, plucks those 
          stray twenties from the air, one, two, three.
           
          MASK
          Sorry, fellas. Waste not want
          not!
           
          And ZZZOOM, he's off again. HOOTING laughter like a maniac.
           
          Freeze pulls his gun.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Get that sucker!
           
          Two cop cars now SQUEAL around the corner, their sirens blaring 
          and ROAR up the street at the bank robbers.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Oh, shit!
           
          The robbers race back to the van, dive inside and PEEL OUT. The 
          police open fire as they roar after them in hot pursuit. Bullets 
          tear into the 
          van, blowing out the rear windows.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. MONKEY'S PAW
           
          The die-hard crowd of TRENDIES is piled up outside as usual 
          clamoring to get in. But a buzz of excitement begins to travel 
          through the crowd 
          as one by one they notice...
           
          A LIMOUSINE
           
          But not just any limousine. As it slowly pulls up by the front of 
          the club we realized it's long... longer... the longest limousine 
          we'vve ever seen. 
          Finally the passenger door rolls into sight and the limo comes to 
          a halt.
           
          The door bursts open and out leaps the Mask.
           
          THE MASK
          Ah... my public!
           
          The crowd parts like the Red Sea as the Mask sashays to the front 
          door. Bobby the Bouncer gets one look at the Mask and actually 
          loses his 
          cool.
           
          BOBBY
          Er, uh... Are you on the list?
           
          THE MASK
          No, but I believe my friends are.
          (fans a wad of cash)
          Jackson, Lincoln and Roosevelt.
           
          He tosses a handful of loot in the air and struts into the club 
          as the crowd scrambles for the cash.
           
          INT. MONKEY'S PAW
           
          This is the first time we've gotten a good look at the place and 
          it's a real eyeful. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO REVEAL its wild tropical 
          DECOR 
          complete with live exotic birds in huge indoor Banyon trees. 
          WAITRESSES in leopard skin leotards make their way across the 
          crowded dance 
          floor with trays full of oversized tropical drinks.
           
          CAMERA ENDFRAMES as the hostess seats Dorian at his favorite 
          ringside table and removes the "reserved" sign. The lights dim an 
          all eyes 
          go to the bandstand.
           
          ANGLE OF THE BANDSTAND
           
          A spotlight hits the stage and tropical ferns part like a 
          gigantic fan revealing...
           
          TINA CARLYLE
           
          in a glittering gown that's made of little more than sequins and 
          mesh. If there were such a thing as fashion police this dress 
          would be arrested 
          for disturbing the peace.
           
          She talks/sings the intro of her number a capella.
           
          TINA
          There's all kinds of men
          In this old world
          That seek the affections
          Of a beautiful girl.
           
          But of the men from
          Which to choose
          There's only one type
          That I... ap...aprooove.
           
          And now the band slides in, in classic torch song style as Tina 
          sings "Checks Appeal". She works the room throughout the song, 
          driving the 
          men crazy as she lingers by each table.
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          You can keep your cowboys
          on the farm
          The gigolos don't make me warm
          It's mink my fingers
          crave to feel
          I need a man with checks appeal.
           
          ANOTHER ANGLE
           
          The Mask is seated at a table on the other side of the club and 
          immediately reacts when he lays eyes on Tina.
           
          His eyes BUG OUT on stalks, an AHOOGA horn sounds and his heart 
          starts POUNDING wildly, shooting two feet out of his chest with 
          EACH 
          beat. Customers at nearby tables are astonished.
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          Pretty boys are such a bore
          There's manly macho types galore
          But you'll always know
          The diamond's real
          If you've got a man with checks appeal.
           
          The Mask snatches a bottle off a passing WAITRESS' tray and sucks 
          it down in one gulp. His head VIBRATES like an electric paint 
          shaker. 
          WWWOOOING! He CLAPS both hands on his head to hold it still.
           
          DORIAN'S TABLE
           
          Sweet Eddy looks nervous as hell as he appears beside Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          What the hell are you doing here?
           
          EDDY
          We got trouble. You better come
          upstairs.
           
          Dorian immediately rises and hurries through the corwd towards 
          his office.
           
          ANGLE ON THE MASK
           
          as he continues to ogle Tina. His face now elongates into a 
          wolf's. He HOWLS, WHISTLES, pounds his fist on the table and 
          stomps his foot on 
          the floor.
           
          TINA
          Don't want to see too fanatic
          But dollar signs are so romantic
          I want a love
          That's deep and real
          Just with a man that's got...
          (big finish)
          Checks ap-peaaal.
           
          The audience goes crazy. Tina takes a bow.
           
          Suddenly the Mask ZZZIPS around the perimiter of the club, leaps 
          up on top of the piano and SNAPS his fingers. A spotlight hits 
          him.
           
          THE MASK
          Let's rock this joint!
           
          He grabs the stuffy, tuxedoed PIANIST'S stool and spins it hard. 
          When the pianist stops twirling, he been transformed into a hip, 
          BEATNIK 
          BE-BOPPER who immediately starts pounding out a mean BOOGIE-
          WOOGIE.
           
          The Mask produces a conductor's baton from thin air, spins around 
          and magically whips the rest of the band into a frenzy, WAILING 
          out a 
          driving rock 'n roll tune.
           
          Satisfied with the music, the Mask leaps down onto the dance 
          floor, grabs the astonished Tina and drags her off her feet into 
          a wild special 
          FX JITTERBUG.
           
          THE CROWD
           
          watches amazed as...
           
          THE MASK AND TINA
           
          put Fred and Ginger to shame. Jiving away at warp speed, the Mask 
          movves like a combination of Gumby and Barishnikov. He SHOOTS 
          TINA 
          beneath his legs, SNAPS her back into midair, SPINS her like a 
          baton and hits the floor in the splits without missing a beat.
           
          THE MASK
          S-s-s-smokin!
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE
           
          Dorian and Sweet Eddy enter to find Dr. Freeze, sitting there, 
          gasping in pain with a bar towel pressed against a bloody wound 
          in his side.
           
          DORIAN
          What the hell happened to you?
           
          FREEZE
          I'll be okay. Nobody puts the
          chill on Freeze.
           
          DORIAN
          Where's the money?
           
          FREEZE
          Deal went south, Bro'. Someone
          else hit the place before we did.
           
          DORIAN
          Who?
           
          FREEZE
          Don't know. Dude looked like
          a freakin' goblin or something.
          Next thing we know there's cops
          all over us, man.
           
          DORIAN
          Where's Chun Woo?
           
          FREEZE
          Takin' a dirt nap. It was bad,
          man. Real bad.
          (swallows hard)
          I need a smoke.
           
          DORIAN
          Yeah... sure.
           
          Dorian taps out a cigarette, places it between Dr. Freeze's lips 
          and lights it... but the flame doesn't draw.
           
          Beat.
           
          The cigarette tumbles from Freeze's mouth.
           
          Dorian glances back up and sees that Dr. Freeze's eyes are glazed 
          over in death.
           
          Dorian leaps to his feat and hurls his chair across the room in 
          anger. It SMASHES the mirror over his bar.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Son of a bitch! Who did this
          Eddy? Who?
           
          Eddy is staring at Dorian's T.V. monitor. On it the Mask can 
          still be seen in the midst of his wild dance with Tina.
           
          EDDY
          That's him... That's the guy!
           
          Dorian grabs a .45 from his desk, checks the barrel and jams it 
          in his coat.
           
          DORIAN
          Come on!
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. DANCE FLOOR
           
          The Mask spins Tina all around him like a top and then SHOOTS her 
          straight up into the air.
           
          Amazingly, she continues somersaulting at the apex of her ascent, 
          suspended in mid-air by her magical momentum.
           
          THE MASK
           
          stands there nonchalantly filing his nails, whistling to himself.
           
          Tina continues to SPIN in place high above him.
           
          THE MASK
           
          casually checks his watch. Without looking up he holds out one 
          hand for the catch.
           
          TINA
           
          perfect timing... A final somesault and she drops right back down 
          into his arms. They go straight back into a rockin' hitterbug 
          without missing a 
          beat.
           
          THE WINDING STAIRCASE
           
          Dorian and Eddy race down the steps, guns drawn. Dorian calls to 
          Bobby by the hostess' stand.
           
          DORIAN
          Clear the club. Now!
           
          DANCE FLOOR
           
          The dance's grand finale. The Mask spins Tina around and around 
          his body like a baton in one of those awful Hawaiian fire dances.
           
          As the band bangs out the final bars of the tune, the Mask 
          SCREECHES Tina to a halt, bends her over backwards and nails her 
          with a Valentino 
          kiss that literally blows her shoes off; SSSMACK! KAPOW!
           
          She hangs onto the Mask's tie for support when BANG the tie is 
          shot in half. Tina falls on her cute behind.
           
          C.U. - TIE
           
          The shot-away piece of the Mask's tie flutters to the floor and 
          MORPHS back into a piece of Stanley's pajamas.
           
          DORIAN
           
          stands at the edge of the dance floor, his smoking gun trained on 
          the Mask.
           
          THE MASK
          (gasps in mock horror)
          Gee willickers! Does this mean
          we won't make the Star Search
          finals?
           
          DORIAN
          This means you won't make it out
          of this club alive if you don't
          tell me where my money is.
           
          THE MASK
          Okay...
           
          The Mask immediately whips out an old fashioned pull handle 
          calculator, snaps on a green visor and starts tabulating. KA-
          CHING.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          (fast talking)
          You got a 27.5% in T-Bills
          amortized over the fiscal yeah
          16-3/4% in stocks and bonds/
          (KA-CHING, KA-CHING)
          Carry the nine and divide by the
          Gross National Product...
           
          DORIAN
          Now cut that out!
          (turns to Eddy)
          Ventilate this goon!
           
          Eddy pulls out his .38 and starts blasting BLAM. BLAM.
           
          The Mask dodges the bullets by contorting his cartoon-flexible 
          body.
           
          BLAM. The Mask SPINS once and freezes in a pirouette, now dressed 
          in a tutu.
           
          BLAM. The Mask SPINS again and stops dressed as a matador, the 
          bullet whizzes under his cape.
           
          BLAM BLAM BLAM
           
          A hockey goalie bats the bullet away.
           
          A Russian Dancer leaps over the shot.
           
          A Cowboy DING! takes the hit.
           
          The Mask staggers back... the forwards in a classic Western death 
          scene. He throws an arm around Sweet Eddy for support.
           
          MASK
          Ak... you got me Pahdnuh.
          (cough... cough)
           
          Eddy seems touched by the Mask's dying words as he holds him in 
          his arms.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          Hold me close, Red. It's a
          gettin' dark.
          (COUGH)
          Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller
          out.
          (cough... cough)
          Tell Tint Tim I won't be makin'
          it home for Christmas.
          (COUGH)
          Tell Scarlet I do give a damn...
          I... I... UUG!
           
          And the Mask gives up the ghost, his pink tongue flops out the 
          side of his mouth. Eddy bursts into tears.
           
          Suddenly a huge cartoon AUDIENCE pops up silhouetted in the 
          foreground, applauding wildly. An off-camera ARM shoots into 
          frame handing 
          the Mask an Oscar.
           
          The Mask leaps to his feet and starts taking bows.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Thank you! You love me! You
          really love me!
           
          Dorian pulls out his own .45 and opens fire.
           
          The Mask starts HOOTING laughter and ricochets off the dance 
          floor.
           
          Dorian gives chase, but suddenly the nightclub doors are KICKED 
          OPEN and Kellaway and a squad of police burst into the room with 
          THEIR 
          guns drawn.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Drop it, Tyrel!
           
          Dorian lets his .45 CLATTER to the ground. Kellaway retrieves it.
           
          DORIAN
          Hello, Kellaway. You got a
          warrant or did you just drop by
          for a night cap?
           
          KELLAWAY
          I got probable cause. A couple
          of your boys were spotted knocking
          over Edge City Bank.
           
          One of his men begins to roughly frisk Dorian
           
          DORIAN
          Easy, junior. You're givin' me
          a woodey.
           
          KELLWAY
          One of them was wearin' some kind
          of big green mask.
           
          DORIAN
          For once you're on the right
          track, but that's not one of my
          men. Maybe you ought to try a
          little actual police work instead
          of this harassment bullshit.
           
          KELLAWAY
          This isn't harassment. You want
          to see some harassment?
          (to his men)
          Search the place, boys.
           
          His men begin to tear the club apart.
           
          DORIAN
          Ever wonder why you didn't make
          Captain, asshole? I got friends
          so high up they'd give you a nose
          bleed.
           
          Kellaway hauls off and CRACKS him in the face with a solid right 
          cross.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Well what d'ya know? I guess they
          gave you one too.
           
          Dorian shakes it off and glares at him.
           
          DORIAN
          (SOFTLY)
          You're a dead man.
           
          One of the officers now appears on the stairway.
           
          OFFICER
          Lt., we got a stiff upstairs.
          One of the guys from the heist.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (cuffs him)
          Better call that high-priced
          lawyer of yours, Tyrel. You're
          comin' downtown.
           
          DORIAN
          I'll be back on the streets before
          sunrise and you know it.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Then just think of this as the
          city's way of showing you a little
          hospitality.
          (pats him on the cheek)
          I'll stop by to tuck you in
          myself.
           
          As the police drag Dorian outside, Kellaway notices someting on 
          the dance floor.
           
          CLOSER
           
          Kellaway picks up the slice of pajama fabric that was once the 
          Mask's tie and inspects it closely... It's the same fabric 
          Kellaway saw Stalney 
          wearing that morning.
           
          EXT. CLUB
           
          Kellaway exits and walks right past the poster of Tina. Flattened 
          into the poster, with his arm around her, is a cartoon of the 
          Mask. The eyes 
          follow Kellaway as he speaks to TWO COPS guarding the door.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You're on your own, boys.
           
          COP
          Don't worry, Lt. If he's in
          there, well get him.
           
          Kellaway slips the pajamas fabric in his pocket.
           
          KELLAWAY
          And if he's not, I got a
          feeling I know where to find him.
           
          As Kellaway heads for his car, the Mask slips out of the poster 
          (still flat as a pancake), slides along the wall behind 
          unsuspecting policemen 
          and around the corner to safety.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. STANLEY'S BEDROOM - DAWN
           
          Milo GROWLS, Frisbee in mouth. Stanley wakes up with a massive 
          headache and dark rings under his eyes. The Mask, which lies on 
          the pillow 
          next to him is taking a greater and greater toll. There's a 
          BANGING on the door.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.)
          Police. Open up.
           
          Stanley runs to the closet to hide the Mask. The instant he opens 
          the door, an avalanche of CASH pours out, suffocating him.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh my god!
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.)
          Ipkiss! I know you're in there.
           
          Stanley grabs the Frisbee and starts shoveling the money back 
          into the closet. Now the doorbell starts RINGING.
           
          STANLEY
          All right, I'm coming!
           
          Stanley tosses the Mask and the Frisbee into the closet and SLAMS 
          it shut. He scoops up a few stray dollars and throws them under 
          the bed.
           
          He hurries to the door and opens it, an easy smile on his face.
           
          STANLEY
          Lieutenant, what a surprise! What
          can I do for you?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          You can answer a few questions.
           
          STANLEY
          I've got to get ready for work.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Trust me. Your bank's opening
          late today.
           
          Kellaway steps into the apartment, without waiting for an 
          invitation. Stanley glances nervously back at the closet. Milo is 
          scratching at the door.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Where were you last night?
           
          STANLEY
          Here... mostly. Is something
          wrong?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Maybe, yes. Maybe, no. Maybe
          it's all just a crazy coincidence
          that this so called "Mask"
          character always seems to be
          wherever you are.
           
          STANLEY
          Mask -- who?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Don't insult my intelligence,
          Ipkiss. First, he's spotted in
          your building, then the bank where
          you work and now I find this at
          the Monkey's Paw.
           
          He displays the TORN PIECE OF FABRIC. It matches the piece 
          missing in Stanley's pajamas. Stanley wilts.
           
          Milo YAPS and leaps up, trying to open the closet door.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo. No!
          (moves the dog away)
          Okay, so I went out on the town
          last night. A guy's got to have
          a little fun.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          In your jammies?
           
          Milo is back at the closet door. He's just about got it open as 
          Stanley turns the detective to the door.
           
          STANLEY
          Naw, I just took 'em with me in
          case I didn't make it home. I
          don't know about you, Lieutenant.
          But I've got a pretty good track
          record with the ladies.
           
          Kellaway pulls away from Stanley and begins suspiciously SNIFFING 
          the air around him.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Wait a second... you smell that?
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SNIFFS)
          Bullshit. I hate the smell of
          bullshit. Don't even think about
          leaving town, Ipkiss. I'll be
          in touch.
           
          Kellaway SLAMS the front door, just as the closet door falls open 
          -- spilling all the cash. Milo happily snatches his Frisbee. 
          Stanley sinks back 
          down on his bed.
           
          STANLEY
          What are we gonna do, Milo? What
          are we gonna do?
           
          C.U. - VIDEO MONITOR
           
          A replay of the bank robbery, from the bank's grainy videocams. A 
          blurred image of the Mask is visible as he zig-zags around the 
          bank at high 
          speed.
           
          WIDER
           
          Kellaway sips a cup of brackish coffee as Oliveras FREEZE-FRAMES 
          the best image of the Mask. There's a wild-eyed look of glee on 
          his face as 
          he stuffs sacks full of money.
           
          DEPUTY OLIVERAS
          I don't know, boss. That's one
          helluva rubber mask.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Where's the lab report?
           
          Oliveras hands it over.
           
          DEPUTY OLIVERAS
          We got fingerprints on some of
          the currency, but nothing matches
          Tyrel's men. Looks like this guy
          beat 'em to the punch.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Get the bank's employee files and
          run down the prints on a guy named
          Ipkiss.
           
          DEPUTY OLIVERAS
          You figure it was an inside job?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Yeah, and all I need is a couple
          of prints to lock this wack job
          up 'till doomsday.
           
          INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE - DAY
           
          Dorian's assembled a war council. At the table are Sweet Eddy and 
          assorted Button Men from the city's underworld. An open attache 
          case filled 
          with stacks of money sits before Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          A fifty thousand dollar reward
          to the man who finds this "Mask"
          character before the cops do.
          Get the word out to every street
          hustler and low life in this town.
          (pounds his fist)
          I want him here. In my office.
          Alive. By tomorrow! Now get
          going!
           
          Everybody scrambles out of their seats.
           
          Tina sits in the corner of the room, painting her nails. She 
          glances up at Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          What are you looking at?
           
          TINA
          You. You're losing it Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          I'm losing nothing. Except maybe
          some extra baggage I don't need
          around here.
           
          TINA
          What's that supposed to mean?
           
          DORIAN
          You weren't putting up much of
          a fight when that green goon
          kissed you last night.
           
          TINA
          C'mon, did it look to you like
          I had a choice?
           
          DORIAN
          Maybe you did and maybe you
          didn't, but I know this, one day
          real soon I'm gonna run this town
          and when I do there's gonna be
          payback for anyone who crossed
          me.
          (glares at her)
          I mean anyone.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. BANK - DAY
           
          The place is in general disarray but still functioning, jammed 
          with worried depositors. Stanley makes his way to his desk, his 
          face pale and 
          unshaven. Dark circles ring his eyes.
           
          MR. DICKEY
          Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our
          hands here and you stroll in over
          an hour late. If I have to put
          up with your slovenly...
           
          Stanley develops an odd facial TWITCH, then...
           
          STANLEY
          (EXPLODES)
          Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell
          your daddy how you're running this
          branch like it's your own personal
          piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw
          some of those files we could
          arrange a little vacation for you
          at Club Fed!
           
          Dickey is absolutely shocked into silence by this outburst, 
          then...
           
          MR. DICKEY
          That will be all, Ipkiss.
           
          Dickey turns on his heels and exits. Charlie Schumacher now 
          appears glowing with new respect for Stanley.
           
          CHARLIE
          Woah! What side of who's bed did
          you wake up on?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm not sure.
          (TWITCHES)
          I haven't exactly been myself
          lately.
           
          For a split second, Stanley's entire face CONTORTS into an 
          alarming Mask-like expression.
           
          CHARLIE
          (WARILY)
          Yeah, well you look like you
          could use a little R and R there
          buddy... and as a matter of fact
          I've got just the ticket. Or
          should I say tickets?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm afraid to ask.
           
          Charlie flashes two tickets.
           
          CHARLIE
          Saturday night. Grand opening
          of the Valhalla Casino. Serious
          skirt alert. Everybody who's
          anybody will be there. What do
          you say?
           
          STANELY
          I don't know Charlie, I...
           
          Stanley suddenly spots Tina making her way across the room to his 
          desk.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Excuse me a second.
           
          ANGLE ON STANLEY'S DESK
           
          STANLEY
          Tina... What are you doing here?
           
          TINA
          I heard about the robbery. I
          guess I just wanted to make sure
          you were okay.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, don't worry about me.
          (TWITCHES)
          I'm fine.
           
          TINA
          Are you sure? You look a
          little...
           
          STANLEY
          I'm just having a little trouble
          sleeping is all.
          (BEAT)
          I guess you won't want to open
          that account after all this...
           
          TINA
          I'm not so sure I'll have much
          to open an account with anymore.
           
          STANLEY
          What about the nightclub? I
          thought you were doing great.
           
          TINA
          I don't know how much longer I
          can stay there Stanley. Things
          are getting a little intense.
           
          STANLEY
          Well, there must be plenty of
          other places you could sing.
          Maybe even get a record deal...
           
          TINA
          I wish it was that easy. There's
          thousands of girls out there just
          like me who...
           
          STANLEY
          Not just like you. You've got
          a voice like... like an angel.
           
          TINA
          (lights a cigarette)
          An angel huh? That's the first
          time I've heard that one.
           
          STANLEY
          No, I mean it. You really do.
           
          TINA
          I can vamp my way through a tune.
          But that's not really singing.
           
          STANLEY
          What is it with you, Tina? Why
          don't you believe in yourself?
           
          TINA
          (SIGHS)
          I guess I've just heard a lot of
          promises from a lot of guys. In
          the end they all wanted the same
          thing and it wasn't a song.
           
          STANLEY
          So maybe you've been singing for
          the wrong guys.
           
          TINA
          I'm not so sure there's any other
          kind. Not for me, anyway.
          (RISES)
          Well, I'm glad nobody got hurt.
           
          STANLEY
          Yeah.
           
          TINA
          What about this guy, the Mask?
          Do the cops have a line on him?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm not sure. Why are you
          interested?
           
          TINA
          Promise you won't say anything?
           
          STANLEY
          Sure.
           
          TINA
          He came to the club last night
          and he was just so... well,
          different. I haven't been able
          to get him off my mind.
           
          STANLEY
          Really? They say he's pretty
          weird looking.
           
          TINA
          Yeah. He's ugly... but he's kinda
          cool... y'know, like Mick Jagger.
           
          STANLEY
          You really think so?
           
          TINA
          Yeah. If you hear anything about
          him, would you call me at the
          club?
           
          Stanley nods - unsure of what to say. Tina opens the door, but 
          before she exits...
           
          STANLEY
          Actually... I sort of know the
          guy.
           
          TINA
          What?
           
          STANLEY
          The Mask. We're - old college
          buddies him and I.
           
          TINA
          Are you serious?
           
          STANLEY
          Oh yeah. To tell you the truth,
          I'm sorta covering for him on this
          bank thing. He's not such a bad
          guy, really. He just gets a
          little carried away.
           
          TINA
          I'll say. Do you think you could
          give him a message?
           
          STANLEY
          I suppose so.
           
          TINA
          Tell him I want to see him again
           
          STANLEY
          When? I mean, I'd need to tell
          him exactly.
           
          TINA
          How about seven o'clock tonight
          at Peninsula Park.
           
          STANLEY
          I'll be... I mean, I'll make sure
          he's there.

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - GARAGE - AFTERNOON
           
          Peggy parks her car in her space, locks it up and beeps on the 
          car horn.
           
          When she turns, she notices a shadowy FIGURE watching her from a 
          bark corner of the garage.
           
          She hurries down the row of parked cars, clutching her purse to 
          her side.
           
          The figure follows at a slow but relentless pace.
           
          Peggy fumbles for her keys, finally finds the correct one and 
          enters the building.
           
          INT. APARTMENT HALL
           
          Peggy is relieved as she reaches her apartment door and slips the 
          key in the lock... but the lock is jammed.
           
          She tries and tries again... nothing. Suddenly, a hand enters 
          frame and SLAPS an eviction notice on her door.
           
          LANDLORD
          Sorry, doll. I had the locks
          changed this afternoon.
           
          PEGGY
          You what? You can't do that!
           
          LANDLORD
          You've known we're going condo
          for six months, Peggy. I can't
          stall the owner a minute longer.
          Either you pony up the downpayment
          or you're out.
           
          PEGGY
          Just a couple more days, Phil.
          The paper's ready to give me a
          full time job.
           
          LANDLORD
          I've heard that one before.
           
          PEGGY
          C'mon, at least let me get a few
          of my things.
           
          Phil considers this a beat, then unlocks the door for her.
           
          LANDLORD
          Don't make me regret this. We
          get a certified check by noon
          tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort
          you out of here.
           
          PEGGY
          Thanks Phil. You're a sweetheart.
           
          Phil exits. Peggy picks up her things when she hears an off-
          camera "Pssst." She turns.
           
          THE FIGURE
           
          stands in the shadows by the fire escape. He's got a voice that 
          sounds like he's been gargling glass.
           
          THE FIGURE
          I heard you were lookin' for a
          story.
           
          PEGGY
          Who... Who are you?
           
          THE FIGURE
          Just a guy with a little
          information lookin' to make a
          buck. But maybe I heard wrong.
          You don't look like much of a
          reporter to me.
           
          Peggy gulps back her fear, determined to live up to her job.
           
          PEGGY
          You give me something worth
          printing and I'll get you your
          money. What's this about?
           
          FIGURE
          The guy they call the Mask and
          why Dorian Tyrel's willing to pay
          fifty large to get him.
           
          PEGGY
          How do I find this Tyrel?
           
          FIGURE
          Careful, sweet meat. You break
          this story and he just might find
          you.

          Dorian and Sweet Eddy casually step through the front door of the 
          restaurant's ersatz chalet facade.
           
          INT. SMORGASBORD
           
          Sweet Eddy takes a position by the door as Dorian greets Artie 
          the Swede at a large oak table in the festeively decorated 
          SMORGASBORD
           
          The Swede is flanked by his gunsels as he's served by a big 
          blonde waitress in a classic peasant girl costume.
           
          SWEDE
          Dorian... thanks for coming by,
          kid.
           
          DORIAN
          My pleasure, Swede. It's been
          too long. I was worried you were
          still pissed about that little
          thing with Harry the Hat.
           
          SWEDE
          That? It was nothing. He was
          a pain in my ass anyway. Here,
          sit down, sit down.
           
          DORIAN
          Congratulations on the new casino.
           
          SWEDE
          Thanks, but it might be a little
          early to celebrate. As a
          matter of fact that's why I asked
          you to stop by.
           
          DORIAN
          Is that right?
           
          SWEDE
          Here... have a little something
          to eat. That's Svenska meatballs,
          kid. The real thing.
           
          DORIAN
          Thanks.
           
          Dorian starts to eat.
           
          SWEDE
          So, I tell you Dorian, it's a
          terrible shame. I put all my hard
          work into this beautiful casino
          and what do you think? All the
          sudden I got all kinda problems
          with the city. Big problems.
          The whole deal could fold.
           
          DORIAN
          Maybe I can help you out. I'm
          expecting to come into a little
          investment capital shortly. If
          worse comes to worse and you
          really need to bail out...
           
          SWEDE
          What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy
          a sweetheart? Thanks for the
          offer Dorian, but I think maybe
          I can solve this myself.
           
          DORIAN
          Is that right?
           
          SWEDE
          That's right. You know that
          Councilman you got in your pocket?
           
          Dorian freezes with a forkful of meatballs halfway to his mouth. 
          He notices a PINK CARNATION squashed into the gravy.
           
          SWEDE (CONT.)
          Well now you've got 'im in your
          mouth. How you like that?
           
          The Swede and his men have a good laugh as Dorian spits out his 
          meatball. The Swede pulls a gun and jams it under Dorian's chin.
           
          Sweet Eddy goes for his gun, but one of the Swede's men pops up, 
          jamming a barrel to his temple.
           
          SWEDE (CONT.)
          (to Dorian)
          Now listen close scumbag! You
          want to bw in business with me?
          Okay, we're partners now. I'm
          takin' fifty per cent off the
          Monkey's Paw. You screw with me
          again and I'll send you straight
          down to Hell with your scumbag
          councilman. You can apologize
          for eatin' him for lunch.
           
          DORIAN
          Sure, Swede. Take it easy.
           
          SWEDE
          Good. Now get out of my sight.
           
          Dorian rises.
           
          SWEDE
          Oh Dorian, here's a couple tickets
          to my grand opening. Stop by.

          a piece of wood.
           
          STANELY
          But your book says masks...
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          My book uses masks as a metaphor
          for our complex personalities.
          The masks we must present to the
          outside world... to suppress the
          id. To protect our innermost
          desires.
           
          STANELY
          Yeah, well this one works in
          reverse.

          You're going to have to be willing
          to work on this delusion or...
           
          STANLEY
          It's not a delusion! Alright,
          I'll prove it to you if I have
          to, but I won't be responsible
          for the consequences.
           
          DR. NEUMAN

          objects.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Alright then, go on. You're not
          going to frighten me.
           
          Stanley takes a deep breath and shoves the mask onto his face.
           
          STANLEY
          Whooooooooaaaaa...
           
          He starts spinning around.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Whoa, what?
           
          Stanley just stands there like an idiot. Nothing happened. He 
          tries it again. Same result.
           
          STANLEY
          It didn't work?
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Does that surprise you? The mask
          is nothing but a reflection of
          you - the inner you.
           
          Stanley isn't listening. He's thinking out load.
           
          STANLEY
          It worked last night. And the
          night before. Maybe it only works
          at night... What kind of mask
          did you say this was.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Scandinavian. It looks like a
          representation of Loki, the Norse
          God of Mischief. He supposedly
          caused so much trouble that Odin
          banished him from Valhalla
          forever.
           
          STANLEY
          (GASPS)
          What if he banished him... into
          a mask?
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          (SIGHS)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Ipkiss, we're out
          of time.
           
          STANLEY
          But what should I do about my date?
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Your date?
           
          STANLEY
          You know. Tonight. The park.
          Tina. Do I go as myself of the
          Mask?
           
          Dr. Neuman puts an arm around Stanley and leads him to the door.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Mr. Ipkiss, please. Haven't you
          been listening to anything I've
          been saying? Go as yourself.
          And as the Mask.
          (a beat)
          Because they are the one and the same,
          beautiful person
           
          Stanley sees this is a losing battle. He turns and walks out.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. FORD TAURUS - DAY
           
          Lt. Kellaway sits in this unmarked police car, finishing up 
          lunch. The police band comes on. Kellaway grabs it.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Yeah?
           
          OLIVERAS (V.O.)
          I've got that cross-check from
          the bank files.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          And?
           
          OLIVERAS (V.O.)
          It's Ipkiss, Alright. Stanley
          Ipkiss.
           
          Kellaway smiles to himself. At that moment -
           
          STANLEY
           
          comes out of Dr. Neuman's office building. He gets in his car and 
          drives off.
           
          OLIVERAS (V.O.)
          You want us to pick him up?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Don't do a thing until I tell you.
          Just keep the SWAT team standing
          by. If this guy's half as bad
          as he's supposed to be we'll need
          all the help we can get.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
           
          fires up his engine and pulls away.
           
          EXT. PARK - SUNSET
           
          Topiaried ivy reads: "Welcome to Peninsula Park." A small sign 
          below that reads: "No dumping."
           
          Carrying his briefcase, Stanley enters the park.
           
          EXT. BENCH
           
          Stanley passes through a stand of trees and nearly bumps into 
          Tina.
           
          TINA
          Stanley, what are you doing here?
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, Tina... Hi. You're early.
           
          TINA
          A little.
           
          STANLEY
          I just... wanted to make sure you
          two got together okay.
           
          TINA
          That's nice.
          (sits down)
          You know, I hardly ever stop by
          here. It's hard to believe it
          was just a garbage heap.
           
          STANLEY
          (looking at the sky)
          It's always beautiful at sunset.
          Those methane emissions really
          pick up the colors.
           
          TINA
          Wow. They really do. All those
          pinks and greens.
           
          STANLEY
          Well... I'm sure my cousin will
          be along any minute. He never
          shows up anywhere 'till after
          sundown. He's sort of strange
          that way.
          (RISES)
          I guess I'll get going.
           
          TINA
          No, Stanley. Stay for a second.
          I was thinking about what you said
          and I, uh, I want you to know I
          appreciate it. Maybe you're
          right. If I believed in myself
          a little more I wouldn't rely on
          guys like Dorian.
           
          STANLEY
          Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel?
           
          TINA
          Yeah. He's sort of my manager.
           
          STANLEY
          Tina, you've got to be careful
          of that guy. He's a dangerous
          criminal.
           
          TINA
          You really mean that, don't you?
           
          STANLEY
          Absolutely. You ought to hear
          the stories...
           
          TINA
          No, I mean, you're really worried
          about me. That's... real sweet,
          Stanley.
           
          STANLEY
          C'mon, Tina this is serious. How
          involved are you with this guy?
           
          TINA
          I can take care of myself,
          Stanley. I always have.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, really? People close to Tyrel
          have a nasty habit of turning up
          dead, or haven't you noticed?
           
          TINA
          Look, this may sound a little cold
          but I do what I have to do to get
          by, okay? I'm nobody in this town
          without Dorian.
           
          STANLEY
          And who are you with him Tina?
          I'm not exactly sure who I am
          anymore but at least I'm trying
          to find out. If you really had
          any faith in yourself, you
          wouldn't be hanging on to some
          kind of free ride.
           
          That last bit stung, and Stanley knows it. A shadow falls over 
          them as the last rays of the sun disappear behind the clouds.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          (SIGHS)
          I'm sorry Tina. I guess I better
          get going.
           
          Stanley gets up and hurries off through the trees.
           
          TINA
          (RISES)
          Stanley... wait!
           
          But he's already disappeared. Tina starts to follow after when 
          she hears a strange WHOOOSH. A whirlwind begins to kick up the 
          leaves all 
          around her.
           
          The Mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory 
          and literally sweeps her off her feet. With his lower lip thrust 
          out he romances 
          Tina in a deep syrupy French voice.
           
          THE MASK
          Cher! Ce moi! Je'taime, Je'
          taime, Je any old tame! At last
          we are together mon petite bon
          bon!
           
          ANGLE ON THE BUSHES
           
          Kellaway, Doyle, and two other officers are watching from a 
          distance. He speaks into his walkie talkie in hushed tones.
           
          KELLAWAY
          This is Kellaway. I need back
          up and I need it now! Every
          available man down to Peninsula
          Park.
           
          INT. NEWSROOM - BULLPEN
           
          MURRAY, an old timer newshound hurries into the room, grabs his
          notebook and pulls on his coat.
           
          MURRAY
          Looks like it's gonna be a long
          night. My wife is gonna kill me.
           
          PEGGY
          What is it, Murray?
           
          MURRAY
          The cops got your pal Ipkiss
          staked out at Peninsula Park.
          We just picked it up over the
          police band.
           
          PEGGY
          Let me cover it, Murray! You go
          on home to Claire.
           
          MURRAY
          I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey
          said...
           
          PEGGY
          (grabs her coat)
          I'll take care of Ramsey. Thanks
          a million. I owe you one.
           
          She gives Murray a quick peck on the cheek and runs out the door.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. PENINSULA PARK
           
          The Mask is all over Tina like a cheap suit, stroking her hair 
          grabbing her bod. She's definitely having second thoughts about 
          him as he backs 
          her up to the bench.
           
          THE MASK
          Our love is like a red red rose,
          and I'm feeling so thorny already,
          I'd like to nip you in the bud!
           
          She ducks his grab, but he recovers smoothly, flipping out a pack 
          of cigarettes. He pops one in her mouth.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Cigarette?
           
          His hand is a blur of motion as he sticks dozens of cigarettes in 
          her mouth.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Regular? Menthol? Filter?
          Cigar? Cigarette? Tiparillo?
           
          He produces a huge blow torch from within his jacket and pops on 
          the flame.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Let me get that for you!
           
          He grabs the gigantic wad of cigarettes as if they were one, puts 
          them in his own mouth and applies the blow torch. With one mighty 
          SSSUCK 
          he smokes them all down to gray ash.
           
          Beat.
           
          The ash tumbles away.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          (exhales a huge cloud of smoke)
          Aaaaaah. And now... amore!
           
          He throws his arms wide and lunges at Tina.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Freeze!
           
          The Mask freezes in mid-air, arms outstretched and feet suspended 
          off the ground.
           
          KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Put your hands up!
           
          The Mask's lips barely move as he speaks in a tiny voice out the 
          side of his mouth.
           
          THE MASK
          But eu 'tol me 'oo freeze!
           
          KELLAWAY
          Alright, alright. Unfreeze!
          You're under arrest!
           
          The Mask instantly drops to the ground and throws himself into 
          wildly exaggerated expressions of remorse and pain.
           
          THE MASK
          Under arrest! My god! The Law!
          I knew I'd forgotten something!
          (TEARS)
          I was so young! So foolish! So
          full of life!
           
          Tears are gushing from Stanley/Mask's eyes like twin water taps. 
          He puts his hands out and Kellaway slaps on the cuffs.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          What... What'll they do with me,
          Sarge?
           
          KELLAWAY
          Sorry, son. That's not my
          department. Search him!
           
          Doyle reaches into the Mask's zoot suit and starts tossing stuff 
          on the ground.
           
          DOYLE
          Comb - Flintstones vitamins -
          Sousaphone - Bazooka -
          (PAUSE)
          picture of Kellaway's wife...
           
          Kellaway looks down at the photo. It really IS a picture of his 
          wife with a handwritten note: "Call me, lover - 555-1234!"
           
          KELLAWAY
          What the --?
          (PAUSE)
          Margaret!
           
          Furious, Kellaway LUNGES at Stanley/Mask's neck. Two other 
          officers restrain him.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You son of a bitch -- !
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          Jeez, I figured you had a sense
          of humor!
          (PAUSE)
          After all, you married her!
           
          Stanley/Mask honks Kellaway's nose which makes a loud AHOOGA 
          noise and runs for it.
           
          Kellaway starts to follow, but discovers he's now handcuffed to 
          Doyle.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Get him!
           
          The other police officers draw their guns and give chase as 
          Stanley RICOCHETS off through the trees hooting laughter.
           
          EXT. PARK ENTRANCE
           
          A twelve foot high stone wall surrounds the park. Stanley/Mask 
          races through the entryway, SLAMMING the park's huge wooden gates 
          behind him.
           
          CLOSER - THE GATE
           
          The Mask throws an iron bolt, SNAPS on a huge padlock, SLAMS down 
          a steel plate ZZZIPS up a gigantic zipper, HAMMERS in dozens of 
          nails at high speed and throws himself against the gate 
          panting...
           
          But then his eyes BUG OUT on stalks as he sees what lies on the 
          opposite side of the gate.
           
          STANLEY'S P.O.V.
           
          COPS... more COPS than seems humanly possible. They're in cars, 
          armed antipersonnel carriers, hanging from trees, parachuting 
          FROM 
          helicopters...
           
          And they're all aiming serious looking guns at HIM.
           
          BULLHORN VOICE
          It's all over! Put your hands
          over your head or we'll open fire.
           
          Stanley/Mask looks around, like he's trying to figure a way out 
          of this mess - then -
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          Hit it!
           
          With that, a police SPOTLIGHT SNAPS on, and the brightly lit park 
          entry-way becomes a beautifully lit stage. Stanley/Mask strikes a 
          pose, 
          now wearing a straw hat "boater" and weilding a cane.
           
          Pedestrians with radios and ghetto blasters look down in shock as 
          a RUMBA begins playing from every speaker in town. 
          Stanley/Mask SWAYS seductively in time to the music.
           
          A FEMALE COP steps forward, a look of surprise spreaading over 
          her face as, against her will, she opens her mouth in song.
           
          FEMALE COP
          They rave about Sloppy Joe - the
          Latin lothario - but Havana -
          has a new sensation.
           
          It's "Cuban Pete RUMBA" by Desi Arnaz! (Yes, this is a real 
          song!)
           
          FEMALE COP (CONT.)
          He's really a modest guy -
          although he's the hottest guy -
          in HavAAAAna - and here's what
          he has to saaaay -
           
          Stanley/Mask steps up to the "stage" and tilts the boater over 
          his eyes, casting a sly glance toward the crowd.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          ("Latin" voice)
          They call me Cuban Pete - I'm
          King of the Rumba beat - every
          time I play the maracas I go chick
          chick chickie boom!
           
          Gene Kelly on acid, Stanley/Mask punctuates his number with any 
          number of sly gestures - winking, nodding, sliding seductively 
          down a 
          street lamp post, doing repeated "splits" on the sidewalk - it's 
          his big number!
           
          The cops watch this with open mouthed astonishment.
           
          ANGLE ON STONE WALL
           
          Kellaway climbs over two of his men to scale the wall. He can't 
          believe his eyes. Doyle clamors up beside him.
           
          DOYLE
          Hey, he's not bad.
           
          Kellaway shoots him a dirty look.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
           
          waltzes into the street, prancing just inches from the heavily 
          armed cops. His legs twine around each other like spaghetti, then 
          his upper torso 
          SPINS until they're straightened out again.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          (still singing)
          Yessir, I'm Cuban Pete! The craze
          of my native street! When I start
          to dance everything goes chick
          chick chickie boom!
           
          Like some weird, loony case of mass hypnosis, Stanley/Mask waits 
          for the "musical break" to coax the armed cops into JOINING him 
          on the 
          number - as the rough and tumble equivalent of CHORUS GIRLS!
           
          ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN FROM HELICOPTER
           
          The street takes the look of a Busby Berkeley musical as the cops 
          HIGH STEP in time to the infectious RUMBA beat.
           
          EXT. STONE WALL - NIGHT
           
          Kellaway leaps/tumbles down from the wall into some bushes and 
          scrambles to his feet. He can't believe his eyes. His cops, his 
          tac squad, his 
          friggin' SWAT team - they're ALL in the street, dancing with this 
          crazy maniac!
           
          Stanley/Mask sidles up to a heavily armed female SWAT officer, 
          "dirty dancing" her across the street -
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          The senoritas they sing, and how
          they sling their sombreros --!
          (It's very nice! So full of
          SPIIIIICE--)
          (dip!)
          And when they're dancing they
          bring a happy ring to their
          vaqueros - they sing their song,
          all the day loonnnggg -
           
          Doyle crash lands beside Kellaway and starts out to join the 
          others, but Kellaway grabs him by the back of his jacket.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You go out there and I'll blow
          your brains out!
           
          Furious, Kellaway yanks open the door of an abandoned squad car, 
          pulls out a tear gas gun and fires into the air. The sharp REPORT 
          AND 
          stinging gas seems to break the spell of THE MASK. The music 
          suddenly STOPS and the high stepping cops stagger away from the 
          CHORUS 
          line, looking confused.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Goddamn it! Arrest that thing!
           
          The cops - shaken back to reality - fumble for their weapons.
           
          THROUGH THE SMOKE
           
          The Mask takes off - dashing into the crowd.
           
          KELLAWAY
           
          spots the Mask and races after him, calling his men.
           
          KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          This way!
           
          THE MASK
           
          bumps into an OLD LADY who SCREAMS at his hideousness.
           
          The Mask realizes how obvious he is. He turns away and brings his 
          arms to his head. There's a RIPPPING sound. And when he turns 
          around, 
          the Mask has now transformed back into...
           
          STANLEY
           
          Carrying the mask, Stanley tries to blend in with the crowd.
           
          KELLAWAY
           
          followed by a handfull of officers bears down on him.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Halt! Halt or we'll shoot!
           
          Stanley quickly cuts down...
           
          A NARROW ALLEY
           
          Stanley races down the lane - cops hot on his trail. Bullets 
          EXPLODE all around him. Just as he reaches the next street...
           
          A CAR
           
          screeches to a halt - almost running Stanley over. The window 
          rolls down revealing...
           
          PEGGY BRANDT
           
          PEGGY
          Stanley! Get in!
           
          Stanley jumps into the passenger seat.
           
          INT. PEGGY'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
           
          Peggy rips around the bend, easily outdistancing the cops.
           
          STANLEY
          Thanks. Where are we going?
           
          PEGGY
          Someplace where we'll be safe.
           
          EXT. DAILY TRIBUNE BUILDING - NIGHT
           
          The streets are empty.
           
          INT. NEWS SHIPPING ROOM - NIGHT
           
          Stanley and Peggy sit on stacks of bound newspapers in the vast 
          shadowy shipping room. In the b.g., a huge machine spews out 
          hundreds of 
          newspapers on an assembly line. Everything's mechanized: 
          printing, folding, wrapping.
           
          Peggy hands Stanley a cup of coffee. He's a complete wreck, 
          clothes disheveled, rings under his eyes.
           
          PEGGY
          I saw it. I saw the whole thing.
          What's happening to you, Stanley?
           
          STANLEY
          It's crazy... I've lost all
          control. When I put on this mask
          I can do anything... be anything,
          but it's ruining my life.
           
          PEGGY
          Stanley, I don't know what's
          happening to you, but I do know
          this. That letter you sent my
          column was from a guy with more
          guts and heart than any of the
          creeps I've met in Edge City.
          Whatever this mask is, you don't
          need it. You... Stanley Ipkiss,
          are already all you ever need to
          be.
           
          STANLEY
          Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean
          that?
           
          PEGGY
          (PAUSES)
          Actually... no.
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          We now hear a door open and footsteps.
           
          PEGGY
          (RISES)
          What took you guys so long? I've
          been vamping here for twenty
          minutes.
           
          Dorian and three of his men stand there with their guns trained 
          on Stanley.
           
          DORIAN
          This is him?
           
          PEGGY
          You have the fifty thou?
           
          Sweet Eddy FLICKS open a briefcase lined with cash.
           
          PEGGY (CONT.)
          Right. When he puts on the mask
          he becomes that green thingamajig.
           
          STANLEY
          (still dumbfounded)
          Peggy, what are you doing?
           
          PEGGY
          Sorry, Stanley. You really are
          a great guy, but I just can't lose
          my condo. You know how hard it
          is to find an apartment in this
          city.
           
          Sweet Eddy and a second thug grab Stanley and hang him over the 
          steel maw of the whirring news press.
           
          DORIAN
          Okay Ipkiss. Where's the money
          from the heist?
           
          STANLEY
          My aparment. It's in my
          apartment!
           
          DORIAN
          Thanks. Now I believe you have
          a pressing engagement.
           
          PEGGY
          Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt
          him!
           
          Dorian toys with the wooden mask, enjoying his control over the 
          situation.
           
          DORIAN
          You're right. Easy boys. One
          thing at a time. Tell me about
          this mask, Ipkiss. How does it
          work?
           
          STANLEY
          I don't know... You just put it
          on!
           
          The Mask FX theme builds, Dorian raises the mask to his face.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Better be careful, boss.
           
          With a CRACK of thunder a whirlwind of light and power swirls 
          around Dorian's figure. Unlike Stanley's transformation, Dorian's 
          is much more 
          diabolical. He grows and changes within a nimbus of ROARING 
          light. Finally the light dies away and Dorian/Mask rises from a 
          circle of swirling 
          smoke.
           
          C.U. DORIAN/MASK
           
          While Stanley was a zoot suited bee-bopper in hyper-drive, 
          Dorian/Mask is more like a hulking evil GENIE, fresh out of the 
          lamp and pissed at 
          the world. His diamond earring and touches of his neuvo-gangster 
          look is still apparent, but his huge grin stretches out like a 
          TYRANNOSAURUS 
          Rex's under eyes that glow green with wicked power. His voice is 
          a deep inhuman RUMBLE.
           
          DORIAN
          What a rush.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Whoa, boss... are you okay?
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          I'm better than ever, you idiot.
          Now stop the presses. There'll
          be a new headline tonight.
           
          Sweet Eddy stands there looking disappointed with Ipkiss still 
          held dangling above the churning presses.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          But what about him?
           
          Dorian/Mask wheels about and ROARS at Sweet Eddy.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          DO AS I SAY! I have other plans
          for Ipkiss. Everything's become
          so clear to me now!
           
          Peggy sheepishly reaches for the suitcase.
           
          PEGGY
          Ah... excuse me. If you don't
          mind, I'll just take my money and
          be going. You guys make
          yourselves at home.
           
          Dorian/Mask slides up to Peggy threateningly.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Must you go? What a shame. You
          and I could make beautiful
          headlines together.
           
          Peggy removes his arm from her shoulder.
           
          PEGGY
          Thanks, anyway. That wasn't part
          of the deal.
           
          Peggy snatches the briefcase, but Dorian/Mask blocks her exit.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Of course. You only want what's
          coming to you, don't you?
           
          Peggy whips out a snub-nose .38 out from beneath her coat.
           
          PEGGY
          Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't
          born yesterday.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Ah... But you might die today!
           
          Dorian throws the switch and the presses CHURN to life. In a 
          flash he snatches Peggy off her feet.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          A girl like you deserves
          to have her face plastered all
          over page one.
           
          He tosses her into the grinding mill of steel and paper.
           
          CAMERA BOOMS DOWN as Peggy's feet disappear between the presses' 
          huge rollers and continues down, down past the whirling gears and 
          hydraulics to finally ENDFRAME on the chute where the newspapers 
          roll out on a conveyor belt.
           
          Headlines in blood red ink now read: "Reporter Killed in Freak 
          Accident" next to a picture of a slightly flattened-looking 
          Peggy, her mouth open 
          in a silent scream.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          What do we do with Ipkiss?
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          The police are looking for the
          Mask. We shall give them the
          Mask. And Eddy...
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Yeah, Dorian?
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Get the boys ready. The Swedes'
          expecting us at the casino opening
          tomorrow night. We wouldn't want
          to disappoint him, would we?
           
          Dorian/Mask throws his head back and lets loose a deep BOOMING 
          LAUGH. It's unnerving even to Eddy, but he laughs nervously in 
          RESPONSE 
          and elbows the other thugs to join in.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
           
          The door is kicked open and two of Dorian's henchmen burst into 
          the room. Milo leaps off the couch and scrables behind the 
          curtains. They 
          yank open the closet door and start scooping the cash into 
          plastic garbage bags.
           
          EXT. STREET - CAR
           
          Stanley lies in the back seat, gagged, bound hand and foot and 
          half hidden under a blanket. A thug in the driver's seat pokes 
          his .45 under 
          Stanley's nose.
           
          THUG
          That money better be where you
          said it was, Ipkiss or you can
          Ipkiss your ass goodbye.
           
          He chuckles at his own little joke.
           
          INT. APARTMENT
           
          Milo peeks out from behind the curtain as the henchmen finish 
          their job. He ducks behind the curtain and looks out the window.
           
          MILO'S P.O.V.
           
          of the henchmen's car. Stanley can barely be seen peeking out the 
          car window. The henchmen pushes him back down.
           
          MILO
           
          His ears perk up. The boss is in trouble! He checks back outside 
          the curtain.
           
          THE HENCHMEN
           
          finish up and start out the door carrying the trash bags. Milo 
          races right by them, just out of sight.
           
          EXT. STREET
           
          The henchmen hop in and start the engine. As the car peels out 
          into traffic, Milo appears, valiantly racing along the sidewalk, 
          DODGING 
          pedestrians and cross-traffic to keep the car in sight.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
           
          Dejected, Lt. Kellaway heads up the steps with Sgt. Doyle.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          I still can't believe it.
          Hardened cops dancin' in the
          streets... and broadcast all over
          the ten o'clock news.
           
          DOYLE
          The SWAT team got an offer to open
          for Wayne Newton.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          I'm history. The Captain's going
          to have my badge for breakfast.
          With a little pension on top.
           
          DOYLE
          C'mon Lieutenant, it wasn't your
          fault. Something will turn up.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Sure. Stanley Ipkiss is going
          to fall right into my lap...
           
          A car SCREECHES BY. The door flies open and a BODY comes tumbling 
          out - knocking Kellaway down. He looks up at the body sitting in 
          HIS

          ...Ipkiss!
           
          STANLEY
          I can explain everything...
           
          DOYLE
          Don't bother.
           
          Doyle pulls a GREEN RUBBER MASK out of Stanley's pocket. Kellaway 
          starts hauling him up the precinct steps.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          You have the right to remain
          silent, you freakin' Looney Tune.
          Anymore of your half-baked
          wisecracks can and will be used
          against you by me, personally...
           
          STANLEY
          You've got to listen to me!
           
          Kellaway and Doyle drag Stanley into the precinct - just as MILO 
          charges up. But the dog is shut out of the station.
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
           
          Bruised, beaten and exhuasted - Stanley's thrown into a small 
          cell. The KEY-GUARD locks the cell up - then walks away.
           
          Stanley looks around his dismal quarters. A filthy toilet. The 
          cot even worse. There's a YOWLING. He climbs up on the cot and 
          looks out the 
          small, barred window.
           
          STANLEY'S P.O.V.:
           
          There's a dumpster below the window, overflowing with trash. Next 
          to the trash heap - is MILO. The dog looks up at Stanley and YIPS 
          happily. 
          Stanley forces a smile.
           
          STANLEY
          Go find yourself a new home, Milo.
          It looks like I'm going to be here
          for a long long time...
           
          Milo watches Stanley recede back into the cell.
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - DAWN
           
          Stanley lies on his cot - staring at the ceiling. The Guard bangs 
          on the door.
           
          GUARD
          Wake up. You gotta visitor.
           
          STANLEY
          About time you found me a
          lawyer...
          (a beat)
          ...Tina?
           
          TINA
          Hello, Stanley.
           
          STANLEY
          What's wrong? Your boyfriend kick
          you out for not delivering me on
          schedule?
           
          TINA
          Is that what you think - that
          I set you up?
           
          STANLEY
          I don't know. But I've got plenty
          of time to figure it out.
           
          TINA
          You're just going to have to trust
          me on this.
           
          STANLEY
          Now is not the best time for
          me on trusting women.
           
          TINA
          I ran out on Dorian last night,
          Stanley. I just came to tell you
          I'm sorry. Sorry about
          everything.
           
          STANLEY
          You ran out on him?
           
          TINA
          That magic mask of yours turned
          him into some kind of monster...
           
          STANLEY
          He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa
          in the first place.
           
          TINA
          He's going to the casino opening
          tonight and he's planning to do
          something terrible.
           
          STANLEY
          A real change of pace for him.
           
          TINA
          Half this town will be there
          Stanley. I tried to tell the
          cops, but they wouldn't listen
          to me.
           
          STANLEY
          As long as he's got the mask,
          there's nothing they can do to
          stop him anyway. There's nothing
          anyone can do.
           
          TINA
          There must be some way. How does
          it work?
           
          STANLEY
          (PAUSES)
          It's like it brings you innermost
          desires to life. If deep down
          inside you're a little repressed
          and... a hopeless romantic, you
          become sort of a love-crazy wild
          man.
           
          TINA
          And if you've got a black heart?
           
          STANLEY
          Then the world's going to be a
          very dark place. And if I were
          you, I'd get out of town. Fast.
           
          Tina takes a beat and absorbs this information.
           
          TINA
          Thanks.
           
          STANLEY
          For what?
           
          TINA
          Lots of things. For really
          believing in me when I couldn't.
          For sharing a sunset with me.
          For being the first guy to treat
          me like I was a person instead
          of a slab of meat.
          (a beat)
          And for being any kind of
          romantic. Even a hopeless one.
           
          STANLEY
          (SOFTENING)
          You're welcome.
           
          TINA
          You know, that night at the club
          I knew I met someone special.
          Someone like nobody I'd ever met
          before.
           
          STANLEY
          The Mask.
           
          TINA
          No... the guy that was inside the Mask
          all the time. You. Stanley Ip -
           
          They draw closer. The iron bars scrunch up their faces...
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          --kiss.
           
          They KISS. A sweet, soft and romantic kiss. Then... the KEY-GUARD 
          pulls her away.
           
          KEY-GUARD
          Time's up, lady.
           
          TINA
          I've got to disappear for awhile
          Stanley. I'm not sure where I'll
          go but I'll let you know as soon
          as I can.
           
          Stanley takes a long last look at Tina as she's escorted out.
           
          EXT. STATION - DAY
           
          Warily, Tina slips out of the precinct. She's about to cross the 
          street, but spots a SUSPICIOUS LIMO, engine idling. Quickly, she 
          doubles back 
          and heads -
           
          INTO THE ALLEY
           
          Behind the station. She looks over her shoulder. No one's there. 
          Tina hurries toward the next street and -
           
          A BIG SEDAN
           
          roars up, cutting her off. She turns and runs back the way she 
          came - but freezes when THE LIMO screeches up, blocking her.
           
          Sweet Eddy and Hicks jump out of the limo. She SCREAMS.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S CELL - AT THE WINDOW - SAME TIME
           
          Stanley watches helplessly as Tina is dragged into the limo. 
          Frantic, Stanley runs to the cell door.
           
          STANLEY
          (to the Key-Guard)
          Hey! A girl's being kidnapped
          out there! Do something!
           
          THE GUARD tunrs up the volume on JEOPARDY, drowning Stanley out.
           
          EXT. DORIAN'S HOUSE - DAY
           
          A slick/modern house on the hills overlooking Edge City. Sweet 
          Eddy pulls Tina from the limo.
           
          INT. DORIAN'S HOUSE
           
          Sweet Eddy and Huey enter and push Tina roughly into the room. 
          Dorian rises to meet her.
           
          DORIAN
          (SARCASTICALLY)
          Baby, there you are...
          (he embraces her)
          I was gettin' all worried about
          you.
           
          TINA
          I just went out for a little while
          Dorian.
           
          Sweet Eddy holds up a small suitcase and an overstuffed shoulder 
          bag he got from her car.
           
          DORIAN
          Looks like maybe a long little
          while, right baby?
           
          Dorian grabs her by the throat and SLAMS her against the wall. 
          The pictures rattle.
           
          DORIAN
          You know what happened to the last
          bitch that ran out on me? Do
          you?!
           
          TINA
          (CHOKING)
          No...
           
          DORIAN
          Nobody else does either. Nobody
          ever will.
           
          He tosses her onto the bed. She lies there gasping for breath.
           
          DORIAN
          Now fix yourself up, baby. And
          pick out something pretty to wear
          tonight.
           
          Dorian picks up the mask and admires it.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          We're going to make a big splash
          at that opening. One this town
          will never forget.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
           
          Agitated, Stanley paces around the room. Stanley's eyes pop open. 
          An IDEA! He stands up, clunking his heaad on the upper bunk. 
          STANLEY 
          peers down the hall and sees
           
          THE KEY GUARD
           
          watching a TV boxing match. He's CHEWING on the leather key-chain 
          strap. There's a half eaten sausage and a wedge of cheese on the 
          desk.
           
          STANLEY
           
          climbs up on the cot and looks out the window.
           
          STANLEY
          (stage whisper)
          Milo!
           
          EXT. THE ALLEY - SAME TIME
           
          Just a pile of trash. The dog's gone. Then... a RUSTLE. A filthy 
          blanket moves... and MILO emerges from it - tail waggling as he 
          sees Stanley.
           
          The little dog jumps up, helplessly trying to reach the window.
           
          STANLEY
          Come on, boy!
           
          Milo gets an idea. He jumps on boxes and trash bags, using them 
          as steps. He climbs higher and higher until he's reached the top 
          of the 
          dumpster.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Come on, Milo!
           
          Milo jumps from the dumpster. He almost reaches the window, but 
          falls back down again into the trash heap.
           
          The dog leaps a second time. On this jump, Stanley grabs him and 
          brings him through the bars.
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS
           
          Stanley gathers Milo up in his arms. The dog licks his face and 
          YELPS joyously. Stanley muzzles him and peeks -
           
          DOWN THE HALL
           
          The Key-Guard's SNORING in his chair. The chewed leather key-
          chain strap is still in his MOUTH. His half-eaten sausage and 
          cheese still lies 
          before him.
           
          STANLEY
           
          shows Milo the guard, then whispers in the dog's ear.
           
          STANLEY
          Keys, Milo. Get the keys!
           
          Milo cocks his head at the sound of the word KEYS. He zips out 
          through the bars.
           
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
           
          Milo trots down the hall and approaches the key-guard's station. 
          The dog stares and sniffs at the SNORING man.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S CELL - A MOMENT LATER
           
          Milo returns, slipping back into the cell.
           
          STANLEY
          Good boy...
           
          He pulls the wedge of cheese out of the dog's mouth.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          I said "keys" not "cheese"! Keys.
          K-E-Y-S... keys!
           
          Stanley pushes the dog back out the cell.
           
          FOLLOWING MILO
           
          He approaches the guard and stops - staring at the keys dangling 
          from the man's mouth. Milo jumps up on the desk and bites down on 
          THE 
          key-chain. He starts to pull when...
           
          The guard stirs and almost wakes up. Milo freezes. A moment 
          later, the guard starts SNORING again. Milo grabs the keys and 
          trots back to 
          Stanley's cell.
           
          STANLEY
          Atta boy, Milo. Now let's see
          if we can get out of here.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. VALHALLA CASINO - SUNSET
           
          Built on pilings at the edge of the marina, the extravagant 
          Vegas-like structure looks like a stylized Viking castle. 
          (Production note: Key mater 
          shots will be matte paintings.)
           
          REPORTERS and tuxedoed GUESTS crowd around as the Swede and town 
          DIGNITARIES prepare to cut a huge red ribbon and officially open 
          the casino.
           
          Two statuesque BLONDES in scanty Valkyrie (Viking goddess) 
          costumes present the Swede with a gigantic pair of SCISSORS. The 
          CROWD 
          applaudes and flashbulbs POP.
           
          THE SWEDE
          So, ladies and gentlemen with a
          special thanks to Mayor Tilton
          and everyone else who made this
          possible, I give you... the
          Valhalla Casino.
           
          With a mighty SNAP of the scissors the Swede cuts the ribbon and 
          the doors of the casino open wide.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. STREETS - SUNSET
           
          Dorian's limo barrels through the streets of Edge City followed 
          by two sedans full of his men.
           
          C.U. - THE SUN
           
          as it disappears behind the clouds. CAMERA PULLS BACK as the 
          limo's moon roof slides shut. We tilt down to discover Dorian and 
          Tina, 
          dressed to the nines for the opening. Dorian holds the mask in 
          his lap.
           
          DORIAN
          It's almost time.
           
          Tina nervously starts to light a cigarette. Dorian snatches the 
          lighter away from her.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          I wouldn't do that, Sweetie. We
          don't want to start the
          celebration early.
           
          Dorian flips back a blanket covering four compact wooden crates 
          marked "C-7 - Caution U.S.M.C. Demolition Materials."
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Now sit back and try to relax.
          I've got to change for the party.
           
          Dorian slowly raises the mask to his face as Tina watches in 
          horror.
           
          EXT. LIMO
           
          The tinted glass LIGHTS UP from inside like muted fireworks as

          INT. POLICE STATION - C.U. - SLEEPING GUARD
           
          CAMERA PANS from his snoring mouth down to his gun as a hand 
          carefully lifts it out of his holster.
           
          WIDER
           
          Gun in hand, Stanley silently backs away with Milo at his side.
           
          The Guard chokes off a snore and begins to wake up. He sees 
          Stanley's cell door standing open and goes for his gun... but 
          grasps air.
           
          STANLEY
           
          puts one hand over his eyes and slams the butt of the gun down as 
          hard as he can on the Guard's head. THONK. The Guard drops back 
          DOWN 
          on his chair unconscious.
           
          Stanley peeks from beneath his hand and regards his work. Not 
          bad. Milo yips happily.
           
          STANLEY
          Come on.
           
          Stanley turns and starts for the door when he bumps straight into 
          Lt. Kellaway.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Ipkiss!
           
          Stanley is shocked, but quickly realizes he's got the gun. He 
          points it at Kellaway with greater authority.
           
          STANLEY
          Hold it! I warn you! I'm
          seriously stressed out here!
           
          KELLAWAY
          Easy, Ipkiss. Don't be an idiot.
          You're in the middle of a police
          station. There's no way you're
          just going to walk out of here.
           
          STANLEY
          (PAUSES)
          You're right.
           
          Stanley pockets Kellaway's gun while keeping him covered with the 
          Guard's gun. He pulls the handcuffs from Kellaway's belt and 
          begins to 
          handcuff the two of them together.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Now what are you doing?
           
          STANLEY
          Putting myself in your custody.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You are certifiable.
           
          Stanley unbuttons his shirt and holds it open.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo!
           
          Milo immediately jumps inside and Stanley buttons up. He now 
          looks like he has a pretty nasty pot belly, but otherwise okay.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Okay. Now we have to hurry or
          we'll miss the party.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Of course. We wouldn't want to
          keep Alice and the white rabbit
          waiting.
           
          Keeping the gun jammed in Kellaway's ribs, Stanley folds his 
          jacket over his gun hand. We hear it cock beneath the jacket. KA-
          LATCH.
           
          STANLEY
          Now move.

          The opening is in full swing as the limo and two sedans pull up 
          to the front doors.
           
          CLOSER - LIMO
           
          as the CAR HOP attempts to open the passenger door, it EXPLODES 
          off and shoots ten feet from the car taking the unfortunate Car 
          Hop with it. 
          Dorian/Mask steps out of swirling mists within the limo in all 
          his wicked green glory.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Don't be shy, Tina. I know how
          you like to make an entrance.
           
          He pulls her out of the limo.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          And I must say, that's a dress
          to die for. Or should I say in?
           
          Dorian's men scramble, hauling the C-7 out of the limo and racing 
          off into the darkness with their automatic weapons.

          INT. POLICE STATION
           
          Lt. Kellaway and Stanley march past POLICEMEN, FELONS and 
          CITIZENS in the front desk area looking stiff and unnatural as 
          hell. Doyle 
          waves hello from the coffee service as he munches on a chocolate 
          doughnut.
           
          DOYLE
          Hi Lieutenant. Where are you
          taking Ipkiss?
           
          KELLAWAY
          Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay...
          ouch!
           
          Stanley jams him in the ribs with that hidden gun.
           
          DOYLE
          What did you say?
           
          Milo pokes his head up out of Stanley's shirt, but Stanley 
          instantly pushes it back down. Doyle does a double-take wondering 
          what's wrong 
          with this picture as they continue their stiff-legged walk out 
          the door. Doyle gives an uncertain wave with his half-eaten 
          doughnut.

          show place featuring a dragon-prowed Viking ship that's the 
          CENTERPIECE 
          of the room. The gaming floor is packed with happy PARTY GOERS.
           
          CAMERA ENDFRAMES on Charlie Schumacher as he snatches a drink off 
          a passing WAITRESS' tray and turns to a gorgeous Valkyrie change 
          girl whose helmet has two large horns sticking out of it.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful.
          One look at you and I know how
          your hat feels.
           
          Suddenly Mrs. Peenman appears, pushing her way past Charlie with 
          a paper bag filled with quarters.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Out of my way, Buster. Mama feels
          lucky tonight.
           
          She jams a quarter in a slot machine right behind Charlie and 
          throws her weight behind the handle.

          as they suddenly EXPLODE inward, blowing Security Man off their 
          feet.
           
          Dorian/Mask steps through the smoking ruin dragging Tina after 
          him. He's flanked by a half dozen of his heavily armed men.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Now... let the games begin!
           
          Armed Security pull their weapons, but are immediately blown away

          BLARING. Kellaway sits in the rear of the car with his hands 
          cuffed behind his back. 
          Stanley's at the wheel with Milo at his side. Kellaway is livid.

          The frightened crowd mills about in terror as Dorian's thugs seal 
          off the exits. They frisk down their captives for loot and 
          jewelry. Orlando runs 
          up to Dorian/Mask with canvas sacks filled with money.
           
          ORLANDO
          We scored over half a mil from
          the safe!
           
          A SECURITY GUARD now pops out from behind a mock-stone pillar and 
          opens fire on Dorian. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.
           
          Orlando dives for cover. The bullets seem to have no effect as 
          Dorian rips a Viking spear off a wall display and hurls it 
          straight across the room 
          with supernatural force.
           
          The spear SKEWERS the Security Guard, sends him flying back and 
          PINS him to a slot machine which immediately rings TILT and 
          spills out 
          quarters.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          You can come out now, Orlando.
          I think he got the point.
           
          Dorian hauls Tina over to the Vikin ship where his men are wiring 
          up boxes of C-7 and sticks of dynamite. He slams her up against 
          the prow as 
          his men lash her in place with coils of rope.

          TILTON
          Hey, watch it! Oh, Arnie...

          toy and they look up into the evil grinning of Dorian/Mask.

          He snaps off the kitchen lights.
           
          Stanley spots a THUG standing guard outside the kitchen's double 
          doors. He ducks back down behind a barrel and gets an idea. The 
          label on 
          the barrel reads "Olive Oil".

          THUG'S P.O.V.

          Suddenly Stanley pops up from behind the overturned barrel with a 
          huge frying pan and slams it right into camera. CLANG.
           
          STANLEY

          The Swede struggles desperately as he's tied to a spoke of a huge 
          wooden NUMBERS WHEEL, a kind of upright roulette wheel that's one 
          OF 
          the casino's attractions. Mayor Tilton and two other town 
          dignitaries are tied to the other three spokes.

          lousy scumbag!
           
          Dorian/Mask pulls three Viking hand axes off a wall display and 
          casually begins to juggle them.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Sorry Swede. I've got an ax to
          grind with you. In fact I got
          a couple and I'm afraid they may
          give you a splitting headache!
           
          He nods to one of his men who gives the wheel a big spin. As the 
          captives SCREAM Dorian prepares to throw his first ax.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          Round and round she goes. Who

          Stanley ducks just as a Viking ax splits the dragonhead right 
          next to him in half.
           
          Dorian ROARS with rage as he rushes across the room to the boat.
           
          Stanley pops back up firing his gun. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.
           
          Dorian takes the direct hits. He grins horridly at Stanley and he 
          extends his slimy tongue.
           
          C.U. - TONGUE
           
          The bullets all stand there on end in a neat little semi-circle.
           
          Dorian now sucks in a mighty breath. Stanley grabs a Viking 
          shield and protects Tina and himself.
           
          Dorian blows the bullets back at Stanley.
           
          RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT.
           
          They batter the shield. Stanley's knocked backwards from the 
          impact.
           
          A HUGE GREEN CLAW
           
          drags Stanley out and SLAMS up against the prow next to Tina. One 
          of his men immediately begins tying Stanley in place.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          How touching! The two love birds.
          Just to show you there's no hard
          feelings, I'm going to let you
          spend the rest of your lives
          together.
           
          TINA
          You've got it all wrong! I could
          care less about this creep.
          Nobody could replace you, Dorian.
          Nobody!
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          If you think a line like that's 
          going to save your life, you're
          dumber than he is.
           
          TINA
          (SOFTLY)
          Okay. Maybe it's too late. Then
          all I want is... a kiss.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          A kiss?
           
          TINA
          One last kiss.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          (a beat)
          Sure, why not...
           
          Dorian/Mask sticks out his slimy TWO-FOOT TONGUE, and stick his 
          eyebrows back. Hiss massive lips flutter as he puckers up. But 
          Tina turns 
          her head way.
           
          TINA
          No! From the real Dorian. The
          guy I used to love.
          (BREATHY)
          Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian
          Tyrel.

          I make the decisions! And I've
          decided...
           
          Tina stares at him dreamily. Ego gets the better of him. He 
          reaches up and RIPS the mask off. SSSSHUPP!
           
          DORIAN/MASK TRANSFORMS BACK INTO DORIAN

          He plants his mouth on Tina's -- kissing her roughly. Tina really 
          gets into it. But Stanley watches as Tina slyly positions the leg 
          that he 
          freed up. And...
           
          TINA DROP-KICKS THE MASK
           
          right out of Dorian's hand. It flies into the air.
           
          A SERIES OF SLO-MO SHOTS AS...
           
          THE MASK SOARS THROUGH THE AIR...
           
          DORIAN, ORLANDO and SWEET EDDY ON THE RUN...
           
          THE MASK REACHES ITS SUMMIT THEN TUMBLES DOWN THROUGH THE AIR...
           
          HANDS REACH HIGH... FINGERTIPS GRAZE IT...
           
          But then suddenly... shockingly...
           
          A SNOUT, FLAPPING TONGUE AND BARE TEETH
           
          soar straight up through thr human hands and...
           
          MILO GRABS THE MASK
           
          as though it were a Frisbee. Everyone's stunned.
           
          REAL TIME
           
          The dog lands back on the ground -- the mask firmly in his mouth. 
          He starts to run away but... Dorian grabs his hind leg.
           
          DORIAN
          C'mere, you ugly little mutt...
           
          MILO
           
          legs pumping frantically, is losing ground. At the last second, 
          he drops the mask and jams his muzzle into it. Lightning FLASHES.
           
          DORIAN'S
           
          eyes widen as
           
          MILO TRANSFORMS INTO -- DOG/MASK!
           
          His pint-sized doggy body now has a giant-sized GREEN HEAD with a 
          double-row of JAGGED CANINE TEETH. The plain collar now sparkles 
          with GLEAMING STUDS. RAZOR-TOENAILS distend. The eyes glow hell 
          fire green.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Whoa!
           
          Reflexively, Dorian lets go. Dog/Mask unleashes an incredibly 
          loud SONIC WOOF that explodes glass front slot machines all 
          around them.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Don't let it get away!
           
          Sweet Eddy lunges at the Dog/Mask. But the canine-creature runs 
          between his legs and CHOMPS DOWN on his butt. The tiny dog picks 
          BIG 
          Sweet Eddy up and shakes him back and forth, like a rag doll.
           
          STANLEY
           
          watches this, then takes a look at the TICKING DETONATOR. Less 
          than a minute to go. He strains at his bonds -- forcing the rope 
          into a 
          FLAMING VIKING WALL TORCH.
           
          Tina winces as Stanley's hand-rope begins to burn.
           
          DOG/MASK
           
          uses Eddy as a club -- knocking other Thugs down.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Get him off me!
           
          Dorian raises his Uzi and SPRAYS THE AREA WITH GUNFIRE! Dog/Mask 
          leaps away in the nick of time.
           
          ORLANDO
          C'mon! We've got the money.
          Let's get the hell out of here!
           
          DORIAN
          I gotta have that mask!
           
          Dorian chases Dog/Mask into the maze of slot machines.
           
          STANLEY
           
          burns through his ropes. He frees himself and races to the 
          detonator. 15 - 14 - 13 - 12
           
          IN THE MAZE OF SLOT MACHINES
           
          Dorian stalks Dog/Mask, whistling for him to come. A stream of 
          WATER now trickles down on him from above.
           
          Dog/Mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie 
          laughter. Dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire, but...
           
          DOG/MASK
           
          pounces on Dorian, knocking him flat, then races out of sight.
           
          VIKING SHIP
           
          Stanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks 
          down -- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 -- Stanley pulls the last wire. The timer 
          stops. Tina exhales, 
          relieved, as Stanley unties her.
           
          TINA
          (kissing him)
          You did it...
           
          C.U. - TIMER
           
          as it TICKS back to life... 2 - 1 - 0!
           
          A muffled EXPLOSION rumbles from beneath the floorboards.
           
          EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT
           
          The two front support pilings BLOW UP.
           
          INT. CASINO - SAME TIME
           
          The entire floor TILTS. Gaming tables and slot machines start to 
          slide by. Stanley grabs Tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo! Milo, come!
           
          Dog/Mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the 
          boat as...
           
          THE LAST TWO PILINGS BLOW UP!
           
          The entire casino floor drops straight down.
           
          THE SHIP SLIDES
           
          straight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors.
           
          DORIAN
           
          SCREAMS as the boat slides right over him.
           
          EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT
           
          The Viking ship CRASHES through the doors and SPLASHES down in 
          the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water.
           
          EXT. VIKING SHIP - NIGHT
           
          It bobs for a moment, then floats! Stanley, Tina and the dog 
          emerge from their hiding place, under one of the dining tables.
           
          They can't quite believe they're alive. Their faces reflect 
          romantically from the light of the Viking torch sconces.
           
          TINA
          Stanley... we made it. We're
          alive!
           
          Milo lets loose a happy "Whoof!" and leaps into Stanley's arms. 
          Stanley removes the mask with a SCHWOOP and Milo transforms back 
          into a 
          regular dog.
           
          DORIAN
          I'll take that.
           
          They turn as DORIAN clamors over the side of the boat. He's got a 
          gun pointed right at them.
           
          Stanley slides an iron grappling hook through the mask's eye 
          holes and holds it overboard.
           
          STANLEY
          Hold it right there or you'll be
          looking for this on the bottom
          of the harbor.
           
          Dorian stops in his tracks.
           
          DORIAN
          Drop it and I'll kill you all.
           
          STANLEY
          You can have it. But she gets
          to go.
           
          DORIAN
          Fine.
           
          TINA
          Go where?
           
          STANLEY
          Swimming. We're still close to
          shore.
           
          DORIAN
          Five seconds, Ipkiss.
           
          Stanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to Tina.
           
          STANLEY
          Go ahead. Hurry...
           
          Tina takes the dog and slips overboard. Dorian moves in.
           
          DORIAN
          Okay. Put it down. Right over
          there.
           
          Dorian waves his gun at the nearest dining table. Stanley starts 
          to put down the mask. But at the last instant -- he tosses it
           
          INTO THE PILE OF TNT
           
          As Dorian turns to see where it lands, Stanley jumps him. Dorian 
          FIRES but misses. Stanley jumps Dorian -- knocking his gun away.
           
          Dorian falls into one of the WALL TORCHES -- toppling it.
           
          The TWO MEN slug it out as a FIRE STARTS. It burns closer and 
          closer to the dynamite -- the mask in the middle of the pile.
           
          IN THE WATER
           
          Tina and Milo cling to the floating barrel.
           
          TINA
          (sees fire)
          Stanley! The dynamite!
           
          BACK ON BOARD
           
          Dorian pummels Stanley with a flurry of jabs to the head as the 
          FIRE SEARS toward the explosives.
           
          But Stanley counters with a solid right that rocks Dorian back. 
          Dorian grabs him by the collar to retaliate but sees...
           
          The FIRE licking at the dynamite casing on which the mask lies.
           
          Dorian lunges for the mask. Stanley jumps overboard. The dynamite 
          explodes!
           
          FROM THE WATER
           
          Tina and Milo watch as the ship blows up. The fireball burns 
          bright, smoke everywhere.
           
          TINA
          ...Stanley?
           
          Beat. Stanley surfaces gasping for breath. Tina pulls him over to 
          the barrel and Milo licks his face.
           
          And then the smoke parts revealing...
           
          DORIAN/MASK
           
          standing on the remains of the boat. Like Wile E. Coyote, he's 
          charred pitch black, with singed hair and clothes. But like a 
          cartoon -- he just 
          shakes off the soot and stands there in all his fearsome 
          Dorian/Mask glory.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          What a BLAST! This mask makes
          me a god!
           
          He picks up the last fizzing, but UNDETONATED STICK OF TNT and 
          laughs.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          I'm immortal...
           
          He raises his arms and thunders to the heavens. At that moment -- 
          the SUN peaks over the horizon.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          Do you hear? I'm immortal!
           
          The sun's rays hit the Mask. In an instant, he transforms back to 
          regular Dorian. The mask pops off Dorian's face -- useless.
           
          Dorian stares dumbfounded at the TNT stick in his hand as it --
           
          KA-BOOM! Dorian is blown to smithereens.
           
          EXT. MARINA - DAWN
           
          There are cops everywhere. Lt. Kellaway wraps Tina in a dry 
          blanket. Stanley holds out his arms.
           
          STANLEY
          Back to jail, Lieutenant?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Ipkiss, I'd like to lock you up
          for the rest of my life. But the
          mayor and a hundred other witnesses say
          Dorian Tyrel's the bad guy and
          you're the good guy. So no jail.
          Just a downtown parade at noon.
          (RESIGNED)
          And I've got to be your escort.
           
          Stanley smiles and puts his arms around Tina. They head down the 
          beach. The two young lovers and Milo walk past --
           
          CHARLIE SCHUMACHER
           
          standing near the crowd of post-party VICTIMS being helped by the 
          POLICE and MEDICAL PERSONNEL. He's still hitting on that 
          STATUESQUE 
          Valkyrie change girl.
           
          CHARLIE
          So I deck this thug, grab his gun
          and tell Stanley, "Take cover,
          Buddy. I'll get these folks out
          sae and sound." Y'know
          we should go back to my place so
          I can tell you the rest of the
          story.
           
          ANGLE ON SHORELINE
           
          Mrs. Peenman is walking along grumbling to herself when she 
          notices the mask floating to shore with some of the wreckage from 
          the boat.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Just look at this mess...
           
          She picks it up out of the surf and The Mask FX theme begins to 
          pound in her head.
           
          Back to Charlie and his Valkyrie.
           
          CHARLIE
          So what do you say, sweetheart?
          Let's you and me go back to my
          place and scramble some eggs.
           
          Suddenly Mrs. Peenman/Mask ZZZIPS up and sweeps Charlie off his 
          feet. She's the most whacked-out Mask creature yet with a huge 
          GREEN 
          Witch Hazel face and Bride of Frankenstein hair.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN/MASK
          Hello short, dark and handsome!
          C'mere and give Momma a kissy-poo!
           
          She starts SMACKING her king-sized lips horribly.
           
          CHARLIE
          (TERRIFIED)
          Yah! Put me down!
           
          She jams a hand down the front of Charlie's pants.
           
          MRS.PEENMAN/MASK
          Let's see what caliber pistol
          you're packing there, soldier boy!
           
          She gets a grip and squeezes. AHOOGA! AHOOGA! Charlie SCREAMS, 
          ttears himself from her grasp and starts running for his life. 
          CAMERA 
          PANS with Mrs. Peenman as she RICOCHETS after him hooting 
          laughter. We ENDFRAME on Stanley and Tina as they watch the 
          BIZARRE 
          spectacle pass them by. They turn and embrace for a well deserved 
          kiss as Milo yips happily and squirms up between them.

The sun peeks over the horizon.   There's a stunning view of
          Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't
          watching.
          As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady THUMP, THUMP,
          THUMP echoes through the apartment.   Eventually, we see MARGARET
          MILLS (37) running on a treadmill, watching "The O.C." on Tivo,
          and reading a manuscript.
          She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero.   As she
          hits a button to stop the treadmill...

          INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          A hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up.   RICHARD
          PAXTON (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure
          out where he is. There are multiple framed pictures of the same
          model on the walls.
          Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is
          6:16 AM.   Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over.

          RICHARD
          Where are my clothes?
          A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers.   SIMONE is the
          model on the walls and is really, really hot.

          SIMONE
          In the kitchen.   I think.   Can I make you
          some coffee?

          RICHARD
          Sorry, I gotta go.   I'm late.
          Richard hurries to the kitchen.   Socks are on the butcher block
          next to an empty champagne bottle.   Shoes in the sink.   He finds
          his pants on the floor and puts them on.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Have you seen my belt?
          Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard.

          SIMONE
          In here.
          She unties the complicated knot.   Richard comes back half
          dressed.   He swallows a little throwup.

          RICHARD
          Baby, I just can't do this anymore.

          

          

          

          

          2.

          INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          Margaret puts on a black suit jacket.   Definitely not off the
          rack.   She makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror, and moves
          off.

          INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          Reflected in the mirror above Simone's bed, Richard hurriedly
          gets dressed as he talks.

          RICHARD
          You're just too much for me.   And I'm just
          another guy too wrapped up in his job.

          SIMONE
          Fine.   Whatever.   Just go.
          Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone.

          RICHARD
          Let's not end it like that. It's been an
          amazing three and a half weeks.   Thank you.
          And you should know that you have the nicest
          ass I've ever been with.

          SIMONE

          (TOUCHED)
          You mean it?

          RICHARD
          I do.   It's magnificent.

          SIMONE
          I work really hard on it.

          RICHARD
          I know you do.
          Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her
          naked body.   Richard shakes his head "no" and smiles.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I really gotta go.

          INT. MARGARET'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

          CRUNCH.   Margaret eats a bowl of Kashi and soy milk while
          standing and reading a manuscript.   Her eyes remain glued to her
          reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher.
          Her apartment is very quiet.

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING

          HONK!   A cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the
          street.   His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          INT. MARGARET'S LOBBY - MORNING

          DING!   The elevator opens and Margaret strides towards the exit
          and the DOORMAN (60).   Before Margaret gets to the door, her CELL
          PHONE RINGS.   She checks the caller ID and excitedly points at
          her phone as she lets it ring.

          MARGARET
          (to phone)
          I knew you would call!   Now come on, tell me
          what I want to hear.   Give it to me.

          DOORMAN
          You have to put it by your mouth so people
          can hear you.

          MARGARET
          You should get paid extra for being so darn
          funny.
          Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out
          the door.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          This is Margaret.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING

          Richard bursts into the skyscraper and runs into a Starbucks.

          INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

          Two coffees lie in wait for Richard.   JILLIAN, a lovely Barista,
          smiles as he hurries to the counter.

          JILLIAN
          You're running late today.

          RICHARD
          Jillian, you are the best.

          JILLIAN
          If you think I'm good at this, you should
          use that coffee cup sometime.
          As he runs out the door, Richard glances at his cup and smiles at
          Jillian's name and phone number written in Sharpie.

          RICHARD
          See ya tomorrow.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

          The elevator doors ahead of Richard begin to close.

          RICHARD

          

          

          

          

          4.
          Mercifully, a hand reaches out and stops the doors.   Inside the
          packed elevator, Richard's CO-WORKERS look sleepy.   One
          particularly frustrated co-worker confronts Richard.

          CO-WORKER #1
          How long is she gonna make us come in by
          seven?

          RICHARD
          She doesn't exactly consult with me on these
          things.

          CO-WORKER #1
          Well this sucks ass.

          RICHARD
          Welcome to my nightmare.
          The doors close as...

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING

          Margaret crosses the street and talks on the phone.

          MARGARET
          You've been thinking about our talk because
          I'm right.   Everyone does publicity.   Roth,
          McCourt, Russo.   Hell, Chabon practically
          whores himself.   Know what they have in
          common?   A Pulitzer.
          (off answer)
          Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty
          years, but that's how long it's been since
          you've written a book this good.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          Richard bursts out of the elevator and passes a clock reading
          6:56 and a sign that announces "Royce Publishing."   He hauls ass
          through a sea of cubicles.   Along the way, grumpy employees
          begrudgingly nod their good mornings.
          At his desk, he pulls a tie out of a drawer and puts it on
          without looking in the mirror.   Noticing his wrinkled suit, he
          pulls out a SPRAY BOTTLE out of the same drawer, sprays it all
          over his body, and then on his head to help mat down a tricky
          cowlick.   Satisfied, he hurries into a nearby corner office.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING

          Margaret walks into the lobby and continues talking.   Employees
          avoid her and pile into the elevator.

          

          

          

          

          5.

          MARGARET
          I'm not pushing so you'll sell more books,
          I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the
          world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius
          piece of literature.   Do the publicity.
          Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears "yes."
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You're making the right decision!   Great
          news.   Going into an elevator, think I'm
          going to lose you...
          Margaret hangs up.   Never give them a chance to change their
          mind.

          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Richard races to Margaret's computer and turns it on.   He picks
          up papers strewn about the room.   He goes back to the computer,
          and opens computer programs.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - RECEPTION - MORNING

          Margaret exits the elevator and receives an enthusiastic...

          RECEPTIONIST
          Good morning!
          Margaret quickly walks by and gives only the slightest nod.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          Margaret walks through the cubicles and nods hello to her staff,
          who all look busy on the phone.   When she turns the corner, they
          stop their "conversations" in mid sentence and hang up.

          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Richard stares at the printer as a sheet of paper comes out.   A
          clock above the door reads 7:00 AM.   The paper clears the printer
          and Richard grabs it quickly.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          Margaret opens the door to her office, and finds Richard standing
          at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other.
          Her office looks perfect.

          RICHARD
          You've got a conference call in thirty, a
          staff meeting at nine, and your immigration
          lawyer sent some papers for you to sign.

          MARGARET
          Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight,

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          6.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (big news)
          I got Frank to do publicity.

          RICHARD
          Nice job.

          MARGARET
          When I want your praise, I'll ask for it.
          Is Bob here?

          RICHARD
          I'm sure.   You want him on the phone?

          MARGARET
          We're going to his office.   Grab your pad.
          Richard calmly backs out of the office...

          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

          ... but once he's out of Margaret's sight he runs to his computer
          and sends an instant message to the office "The Banshee is headed
          to Bob's office."

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          As the message pops up on computers, the quiet office jumps to
          life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes
          their imaginary conversations.

          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - MORNING

          Margaret comes out to Richard's desk.   She notices his coffee cup
          with Jillian's number on it.   She takes special notice of the
          hearts that dot the "I's" in Jillian.

          MARGARET
          That's cute.   You gonna call her today?

          RICHARD
          What?
          Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she
          nods at the cup.   He's embarrassed.

          MARGARET
          Are you bored here?   Do you need little
          distractions like that to get you through
          the day?

          RICHARD
          Uh...

          MARGARET
          You have another late night out?

          RICHARD

          

          

          

          

          7.
          Margaret starts walking.   Richard quickly catches up, worried
          because he doesn't know where she's going with this.

          MARGARET
          I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got
          hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head,
          and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday.

          RICHARD
          Oh.   Well, it won't be wrinkled for long.

          MARGARET
          You'll magically unwrinkle?

          RICHARD
          Yes.

          MARGARET
          You have magic pants?

          RICHARD
          No.   I've sprayed them with stuff that will
          take care of the wrinkles.

          MARGARET
          Does this work on more than just your pants?

          RICHARD
          Anything that's wrinkled.

          MARGARET
          Buy me some.

          RICHARD
          Will do.
          Richard makes a note.   Margaret stops to make her point.

          MARGARET
          I don't care what or who you do on your own
          time, but when you walk through that door
          you represent me, and I will not have your
          personal life affect you at work.   If you
          want me to think of promoting you to editor,
          I need you sharp, focused and professional.
          Got it?

          RICHARD
          Got it.

          MARGARET
          Great.   Now you're just a prop in here, so
          don't say a word.

          

          

          

          

          8.

          INT. BOB'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Margaret and Richard enter Bob's office, which is decorated with
          beautiful antiques and first edition books.   But unlike
          Margaret's office, this one isn't in the corner.
          Margaret nods at Richard to shut the door.   BOB (42) wears a prim
          bow tie, circular tortoise shell glasses, and the air of
          superiority.

          MARGARET
          Hey, Bob.

          BOB
          Ah.   Our fearless leader and her liege.
          Margaret smiles.

          MARGARET
          I'm lettin' you go, Bob.

          BOB
          Pardon?

          MARGARET
          You're fired.

          BOB
          What?   What are you talking about?

          MARGARET
          This isn't working out.

          BOB
          You can't...

          MARGARET
          I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do
          publicity.   You said it was impossible.

          BOB
          It is.   He doesn't do publicity.

          MARGARET
          I just talked to him.   He's in.

          BOB
          But...

          MARGARET
          No more buts, Bob.   I've been chief for a
          month and a half, and this is the third time
          you've dropped the ball.   You didn't even
          call to ask him.

          BOB

          

          

          

          

          9.

          MARGARET
          All you had to do to was pick up the phone.
          That's it.   Now I'll give you two months to
          find a new job, and then you can say you
          resigned.   I won't tell a soul, my lips are
          sealed.
          Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - CONTINUOUS

          Margaret and Richard walk a few steps.   Margaret looks straight
          ahead and whispers to Richard.

          MARGARET
          What's he doing?
          Richard turns around and takes a peek.   Bob gets out of his chair
          and comes to his door.

          RICHARD
          He's up and about to pop.

          MARGARET
          Oh Bob, don't do it...

          BOB

          YOU POISONOUS BITCH!   YOU CAN'T FIRE ME!
          The office stops.   This is going to be good.   Margaret turns
          around with a disappointed look on her face.   She's deadly calm.

          MARGARET
          What are you doing?   I gave you a civilized
          way out of this.

          BOB
          This is because I'm your competition.
          Because I threaten you!

          MARGARET
          Oh, Bob.   You could never threaten me.   I'm
          firing you because you're lazy, entitled and
          incompetent.   I'm firing you because you
          don't work hard.   So if you know what's good
          for you, you'll shut up, take off that
          ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get
          drunk.   Because if you say one more word,
          Richard here is going to call security and
          have you thrown out on your ass.   Are we
          perfectly clear?
          Bob nods.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Good.   Now I've got work to do, so if you'll

          

          

          

          

          10.
          Margaret and Richard walk away and speak in hushed tones.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          We need to call his authors and explain what
          happened.   And get Frank's publicity
          schedule figured out pronto.

          RICHARD
          No problem.   I'll just cancel my trip this
          weekend.

          MARGARET
          I gave you the weekend off?

          RICHARD
          It was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday.
          But no big deal.   You were right before, I
          need to stay focused.   Professional.

          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - DAY

          Richard is on the phone with his mom explaining why he can't come
          home this weekend.   He sounds like an annoyed teenager.

          RICHARD
          Well tell gammy that I'm sorry.
          (waiting to speak)
          Mom, she's making me work this weekend.
          It's not like I volunteered.
          (waiting to speak)
          I'm sure dad is pissed.
          Margaret comes to Richard's desk.   He tries to wrap it up.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I have to go.   Yeah.   No, I'm not going to
          do that!   No.   Sorta.   Mom!   No.   Bye.
          Richard hangs up the phone.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Sorry about that.   Damage control.

          MARGARET
          She tell you to quit?

          RICHARD
          No.   No.
          (off Margaret's look)
          Um.   Yes?   But as I've explained to them,
          after three years together, you're the only
          person on the planet who can make me editor,
          so that's the way it is.
          Richard's phone rings and he picks it up.

          

          

          

          

          11.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Your 10:55 is here.   Mr. Gilbertson?

          MARGARET
          Who is this guy?

          RICHARD
          He said you knew each other.   You weren't
          sure so you told me to set a meeting.   We
          rescheduled on him four times.

          MARGARET
          Go get him.   But he's out of here in five
          minutes, we've got work to do.
          Margaret leaves and goes into her office.

          RICHARD
          (to himself)
          I'll charge up the cattle prod.

          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAY

          Margaret reads as MR. GILBERTSON (48) sits down.   He's an intense
          man in a bad suit.   He sits in silence until Margaret looks up.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Margaret.   Good to see you.   I know how busy
          you are.   Congrats on the promotion.   Read
          about it in P-W.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   Well, those announcements are silly,
          aren't they?   Like everyone who needs to
          know doesn't know already.
          Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man,
          but now gives up.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Have to admit, I can't place where we know
          each other from.
          Gilbertson smiles.   He didn't expect her to remember.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Three years ago?   We worked together.

          MARGARET
          Don't have it...

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Remember "Dandelion's Desire?"
          Margaret gets excited.

          

          

          

          

          12.

          MARGARET
          Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me?
          That book is legend.   Without a doubt the
          worst ever written.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You think?

          MARGARET
          It was a fever dream!                                         900 offensive and
          pointless pages, with like 30 characters,
          who all had some weird disability.   The
          paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering
          scientist?   Oh!   And there was the asthmatic
          alien chapter -- written entirely in his
          alien language.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I believe there was a glossary...
          Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory.

          MARGARET
          Did you see the pass letter I wrote him?

          MR. GILBERTSON

          (QUOTING)
          "Your grammar is impeccable, but please do
          not confuse superior form with writing
          ability.   Save your skills for the office
          newsletter, you sir, are no writer."
          A beat.   Margaret says matter of fact...

          MARGARET
          You wrote the book.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I did.

          MARGARET
          You're Dante Dickens?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          One of my nom de plumes.
          Gilbertson paces.   Margaret stays seated, at a loss.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.   You
          obviously were spending a lot of time
          writing, I just thought you should channel
          all that passion into something else.
          Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Ms. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and
          Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you
          to Canada.

          MARGARET
          Excuse me?   What?   This is a mistake.   I've
          lived here since 1981.   I'm applying for
          citizenship.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You need citizenship now?   After the big
          promotion?

          MARGARET
          Yes.   And all the papers are in.
          Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Well, my office is going to reject your
          paperwork on Monday, while we investigate
          whether your behavior is well disposed to
          the good order and happiness of the United
          States.   We must protect our sovereignty.

          MARGARET
          I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the
          United States?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will
          take awhile, so you'll be deported while
          your case winds through the system.
          (as if he doesn't know)
          Will it affect you at work if you aren't
          allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two
          to three years?

          MARGARET
          "Affect me at work?"   I'll lose my job!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          (mock sympathy)
          Ahhhh.   That's a shame.   Too bad we can't
          work something out.
          Margaret stops looking at her file.   It all becomes clear.

          MARGARET
          Oh, no.   No, no, no.   I won't do it.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Do what, Ms. Mills?

          MARGARET

          

          

          

          

          14.
          Gilbertson smiles.   She's quick.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I've edited it down.   It's better.

          MARGARET
          Well then, get it published at another
          house.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          They all just don't get me.

          MARGARET
          All?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Well not all.   Two hundred fifty, two
          hundred sixty-one.   Ish.

          MARGARET
          I'll be fired and laughed out of the
          industry if I publish that book.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I'm at the end of my rope, Ms. Mills.   I'm
          an author.   Not some bureaucrat who brings a
          lunchable to work everyday and lives in his
          brother's garage.   You're the last stop, and
          I'm desperate.

          MARGARET
          I will never publish your book.   Ever.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          There's no need to make this difficult.   I
          don't turn in your file until Monday...

          MARGARET
          This is blackmail.   I'll go to your boss.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I've spent two years preparing for this day.
          Don't you think I've thought of that?
          Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on.
          Suddenly, the door opens and Richard bursts in, acting like there
          is an "emergency" so Margaret can end the meeting.

          RICHARD
          Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs
          you right away.
          The sight of Richard inspires Margaret.   She turns to Gilbertson
          with a wicked grin on her face.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          MARGARET
          Know what, Dante?   I'm not going anywhere!
          We're getting married!
          Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about.

          RICHARD
          Who's getting married?

          MARGARET
          We are!

          RICHARD
          You and him?

          MARGARET
          Stop playing around, honey.
          Margaret is all smiles.   Richard is very confused.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS.   I told him
          about us.   About us getting married.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You are marrying your male secretary?

          RICHARD
          Assistant.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You are marrying your male assistant?

          MARGARET
          (matter of fact)
          We're in love.   We tried to fight it.   When
          it's right, it's right.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          And this has nothing to do with my visit
          here today?

          MARGARET
          Nope.   True love.   Got it bad.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          (to Richard)
          You.   Is this true?   Are you marrying
          this... woman?
          Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand.

          MARGARET
          Of course we are.

          MR. GILBERTSON

          

          

          

          

          16.
          Painfully long beat where Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret
          squeezes Richard's hand hard.

          RICHARD
          Uh-huh.
          Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm
          around her.   Richard is truly afraid.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (more of a question)
          I'm, uh, marrying my boss?
          Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that
          she's ready for a kiss.   The two slowly begin to come together.
          Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard chickens out
          and kisses the hair on the top of her head.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Five years in prison and a two hundred and
          fifty thousand dollar fine.

          MARGARET
          What?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          If I prove you're lying, you go to federal
          prison for five years.
          Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          (to Richard)
          You.   Do you know what you're getting
          yourself into?   We're going to put you in a
          room and ask you every detail that a real
          couple would know about each other.   Do you
          even know her favorite color?
          Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret encourages him on with a thinly
          veiled threat.

          MARGARET
          C'mon.   Answer.   You don't have a choice.
          Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents.

          RICHARD
          Plum.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You mean purple?

          RICHARD
          No.   Plum is "smokier" than purple.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Favorite flower?

          RICHARD
          Tulips.   But only when they're in season.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Childhood pet name?

          RICHARD
          Miss Mittens.

          MARGARET
          Are we done here?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Who knows you're getting married?
          Margaret interrupts.

          MARGARET
          No one.   With us working together we decided
          it would be too much of a scandal if anyone
          knew.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Have you at least told your family?

          MARGARET

          (EXCITED)
          My parents are dead!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          How convenient.   So you're not telling
          anyone that you are getting married?

          RICHARD
          Nope.
          Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Pathetic.   Four questions and I've got
          enough to send you to prison...

          MARGARET
          We're telling his family this weekend.

          RICHARD
          We are?

          MARGARET
          Yes.   We are.   We're surprising them...
          (trying to remember)
          ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party.

          

          

          

          

          18.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          And where's that going to be?

          MARGARET
          (no idea)
          At Richard's parent's house.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          And where's that located?

          MARGARET
          (still no idea)
          In his hometown.

          RICHARD
          Sitka.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Is that on Long Island?
          Only Richard has the answer.   Margaret tries to cover.

          MARGARET
          Why don't you tell him?

          RICHARD
          Alaska.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You're going to Alaska this weekend?

          MARGARET
          (Alaska???)
          Yes.   Of course we're going to Alaska.
          That's where Richard is from.
          Gilbertson begins to walk around.   He's getting worked up.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You think you can beat me with this B-S
          story?   Forcing your secretary...

          RICHARD
          Assistant.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...assistant to marry you and then
          conveniently telling his family for the
          first time this weekend?

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry, Dante.   Did you not prepare for
          that?
          Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.

          

          

          

          

          19.
          Enraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his
          appointment book and writes down some information.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          The INS will see you both in ten days for
          your official interview.   Your stories
          better match up on every account.
          Mr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her
          the piece of paper.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          Cross all your T's and dot your I's with
          this ruse, Ms. Mills.

          MARGARET
          There are no "T's" or "I's" in "Love" Mr.
          Gilbertson.
          Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard.   Margaret goes back to
          her desk like this is all in a days work.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Why are you from Alaska?   Sweet Jesus,
          that's inconvenient.   So here's what's going
          to happen.   We'll play boyfriend and
          girlfriend this weekend for your parents and
          that should be enough for this INS
          interview.
          Richard doesn't react.   Margaret doesn't notice.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          So you need to figure out the travel,
          schedule a justice of the peace for next
          week, and get my lawyer on the phone.
          Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          But first, run down and get me another
          coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold.
          Margaret holds out her coffee cup.   Richard doesn't move.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Hello?   Richard?   Richard!
          Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left.

          RICHARD
          I quit.
          Richard leaves Margaret's office.   She still has her coffee cup
          outstretched in her hand.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - CONTINUOUS

          Richard powers through the office.   Co-workers take notice that
          Margaret is following him.

          MARGARET
          Richard, come back here.
          Margaret tries not to make a scene.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Richard.   Richard.
          Richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Come back to the office!
          Richard can't take it.   He gets up in Margaret's face.

          RICHARD
          You shut up.   You just lost your "I get to
          tell Richard what to do" privileges.

          MARGARET
          Well, we need to talk.

          RICHARD
          You want to talk with me?   Fine.   Grab your
          broom and let's go.
          Margaret is dumbstruck.   The receptionist is shocked.   The
          elevator arrives and Richard gets in.   Margaret follows. As the
          doors close, Richard shouts out to the receptionist.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Watch my phones!

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

          Richard and Margaret walk in silence through the park.   Richard
          finally speaks.

          RICHARD
          Your plan is psychotic.

          MARGARET
          Well I'd rather poke my eyes out than play
          pretend girlfriend, but this is the big
          time.   Sometimes you need to sack up.

          RICHARD
          Aren't Canadians supposed to be nice?

          MARGARET
          You wanna be an editor?   You need to make

          

          

          

          

          21.

          RICHARD
          OK.   Fine.   Then if we "make this happen"?
          You're promoting me to editor.

          MARGARET
          I'm doing what?

          RICHARD
          We go to Alaska and lie to my family?   I
          risk going to jail?   Well, you're making me
          editor for that.   I mean, did you think I'd
          do this out of the kindness of my heart?

          MARGARET
          You work for me!

          RICHARD
          You know, during my employee orientation,
          the HR rep didn't mention anything about me
          marrying you.

          MARGARET
          Look, I came to this town alone and with
          nothing.   I've worked my ass off for fifteen
          years and this guy wants to ruin me because
          he wrote the shittiest book of all time?   No
          way.

          RICHARD
          Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that
          sounds like your problem.   Not mine.
          Margaret is stuck.   Richard really does have the upper hand.

          MARGARET
          Fine.   You take me to Alaska this weekend,
          and I'll make you editor.   Deal?
          Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a-
          bed, we're staying in a hotel.   Do they even
          have hotels in Alaska?

          RICHARD
          No.   But they have huts.   Teepees really.
          And you have to poop in a bucket.   But
          otherwise, just like the Four Seasons.   But
          with bears.

          EXT. PLANE TO SEATTLE - DAY

          A commercial jet TAKES OFF and leaves New York City behind.

          

          

          

          

          22.

          INT. PLANE TO SEATTLE - DAY

          Richard and Margaret sit in First Class and work on their lap
          tops.   Richard looks up.

          RICHARD
          Um.   Shouldn't we talk about what we're
          going to say to my parents?
          Margaret doesn't look up, annoyed with the question.

          MARGARET
          Are you done with the press release?

          RICHARD
          Almost.

          MARGARET

          (PATRONIZING)
          Well let's finish big people business before
          mommy and daddy talk.   Okay?
          Dejected, Richard goes back to work.

          INT. SEATTLE AIRPORT - DAY

          As they change planes in Seattle, Margaret walks quickly and
          talks on the phone.   Still the assistant, Richard lags behind,
          weighed down by both their bags.
          Up ahead at the gate, a GATE ATTENDANT (Female, 50's) ANNOUNCES
          final boarding to Sitka.   Margaret gets off her phone.

          MARGARET
          So what do I need to know up there?   Bullet
          points.

          RICHARD
          I told â€˜em we've been dating for six months.
          We've kept it a secret from everyone...
          (under his breath)
          ...and that you're a naughty minx in the
          sack.
          Richard and Margaret make it to the attendant at the gate.
          Margaret is not amused by Richard's attempt at humor.

          MARGARET

          (VENOMOUS)
          Don't make me hate you.
          Margaret hands her boarding pass to the attendant and breezes
          through.   The attendant gives Richard a look.

          RICHARD
          Bringing her home to meet my folks.   She's

          

          

          

          

          23.
          Tangled in the bags, Richard struggles to find his boarding pass.
          The impatient attendant is getting frustrated.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I've got it here.   Sorry.   Guess I'm a
          little flustered too.   Haven't been home for
          awhile, hope they like her!
          The gate attendant smiles.

          GATE ATTENDANT
          (heard it all)
          I don't care, sir.
          Richard finds his boarding pass and hands it over.

          RICHARD
          OK then.   You're a sweet lady.   Thanks.
          Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors.

          INT. PLANE TO ALASKA - DAY

          Margaret takes her seat and sits next to a well dressed HANDSOME
          MAN who is READING A BOOK.   She notices the title and he catches
          her stare.   Margaret explains.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry, I hate it when people stare at
          what I'm reading.   It's just... I worked on
          that book.

          HANDSOME MAN
          You wrote it?

          MARGARET
          Edited it.   It was one of my favorites.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Well you did a good job.   It's great.

          MARGARET
          You don't see many guys with that book.
          You, uh, read a lot of love stories about
          Roman concubines?

          HANDSOME MAN
          My ex-girlfriend gave it to me.   I travel a
          lot for work.   I'll read anything...

          MARGARET

          (SUSPICIOUS)
          Ex-girlfriend, huh?

          

          

          

          

          24.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (smiling, embarrassed)
          OK, you got me.   I'm a closet romantic.   But
          let's keep that between us.
          Margaret smiles and makes the "my lips are sealed" motion.   Just
          then, Richard lumbers onto the plane with the bags.

          MARGARET
          There you are.   Give me my lap top.
          Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag.

          RICHARD
          (re: book)
          Hey, he's reading...

          MARGARET
          I know, Richard.
          Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead
          compartment.   The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Did you two want to sit together?

          MARGARET
          Sit together with who?
          The Handsome man nods at Richard.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Your boyfriend?
          Margaret points to Richard indignantly.

          MARGARET
          You mean him?
          The Handsome man nods.   Margaret tries to set the record
          straight.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          No.   No.   No.   He's my assistant.

          HANDSOME MAN
          You're bringing your assistant all the way
          to Alaska?
          Richard smiles, happy that Margaret has to answer.

          RICHARD
          Oh, you can tell him the truth.

          MARGARET
          Well, he's... indispensable.

          

          

          

          

          25.
          The Handsome man isn't buying it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          And gay.   Takes care of me everywhere I go.
          Call him my queen mother.   Aren't you my
          indispensable gay queen mother?
          Margaret shoots Richard a nasty look.   He has to go along.

          RICHARD
          That's me.
          Richard turns to close the overhead compartment.

          HANDSOME MAN
          You're awfully nice to fly him first class.
          Margaret nods her head and agrees.   It sucks to be Richard.

          EXT. AERIAL OF SITKA - DAY

          We see the natural beauty of South Eastern Alaska.   Sitka is an
          island the size of Maui.   Only an eight mile stretch of coast is
          inhabited, the rest is complete wilderness.   At the center of the
          island is a mountain with smaller hills around it.   The coast is
          dotted with fishing boats.   Gorgeous.

          INT. JETWAY - DAY

          Margaret and the Handsome Man chat like old friends while they
          walk off the plane.   Richard follows with all the bags.   As they
          all walk out of the jetway they see...

          INT. AIRPORT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          A big banner that reads: CONGRATULATIONS RICHARD AND MARGARET!!!
          with wedding bells and a graphic showing the journey from New
          York to Sitka.   The banner is being held up by a group of 30
          PEOPLE with excited looks on their faces.
          Richard's mom DEBBIE (60) is front and center.   She's a sweet
          lady who cooked Richard a hot breakfast every morning until he
          left the house.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (89) also waits.   She's lived a long time and
          doesn't have a lot of time to screw around.
          When they see Richard, they SCREAM.   Margaret's face drops.

          ALL
          There he is!!!   Where's Margaret?
          Richard blanches white.   Margaret looks back with eyes that say
          "What the hell is going on?"

          

          

          

          

          26.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (noting banner)
          That's sweet.
          Richard goes over to the group.   Margaret keeps walking.

          RICHARD
          What are you guys doing here?   What's with
          the sign?

          DEBBIE
          So you're "just dating," huh?   I can't
          believe you didn't tell us!

          RICHARD
          Didn't tell you what?

          ANNIE
          We're not saying anything until you let us
          meet Margaret.   Now, where's our girl?
          Richard looks around.   Margaret keeps her head down and tries to
          avoid eye contact.

          RICHARD
          Uh.   Margaret?   You need to come over here.
          Like now.   Honey.
          The Handsome Man sees Richard with the banner people, calling for
          Margaret to come over.   Margaret winces.

          MARGARET
          I have to go now.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (putting it together)
          What kind of sick shit is this?
          Margaret nods.   This would be a tough one to explain.

          MARGARET
          Have a great life.
          Margaret walks toward the group.   Richard puts out his hand and
          silently pleads for Margaret to hold it.   At the last second, she
          takes it.

          RICHARD
          Everyone, this is Margaret.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's nice to meet you.   Now, do you prefer
          being called Margaret, or the Dragon Lady?
          We've heard it both ways.
          Everyone laughs.

          

          

          

          

          27.

          DEBBIE
          Annnie!

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's not like he hasn't told her that he
          used to call her the Dragon Lady.   They're
          getting married.

          RICHARD
          (real "casual")
          Now, ah, where did you hear that?   The whole
          "getting married" thing?

          DEBBIE
          Oh, that man from the government.   Gilber-
          something.   Said he was checking up on you
          two.   Said it was technicality, because
          Margaret was from Canada.

          RICHARD
          What, ah, did you tell him?

          DEBBIE
          Well for one thing, that you were in a lot
          of trouble for not telling us that you two
          were getting married!

          RICHARD
          No.   Really.   What did you say?

          DEBBIE
          Just that you were coming up here this
          weekend.   That we hadn't seen you in a
          while, and that we'd heard about Margaret
          for years, but that we'd never met her.
          Debbie turns to Margaret and takes both of her hands.
          DEBBIE (CONT'D (cont'd)
          The way that Richard talked about you?   I'll
          admit, I didn't see this coming.

          MARGARET
          Me neither.
          Debbie picks up some of the bags and starts walking toward the
          exit.   Everyone else follows her lead.

          ON THE MOVE

          DEBBIE
          So why all the silly secrecy?

          RICHARD
          It wasn't a secret.   We didn't tell anyone.

          

          

          

          

          28.

          DEBBIE
          Well, is your family just anyone?

          RICHARD
          No, I didn't mean...

          DEBBIE
          I should be mad at you two.   But, but... I'm
          just so excited!

          MARGARET
          (re: group)
          Uh, is everyone coming to our hotel?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Oh, we cancelled your reservation.   You're
          part of the family now.     Family doesn't
          stay at a hotel.   Also, we've got another
          little surprise for you two.

          MARGARET
          Surprise?   Another surprise?

          RICHARD
          She's not good with surprises.

          MARGARET
          I'm really not good with surprises.

          EXT. SITKA AIRPORT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Debbie stops.   Sitka Airport is very small, so they are already
          outside by all the cars parked in the loading zone.
          Debbie and Annie excitedly look at each other.

          DEBBIE
          Well you two...

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          ...you're getting married this weekend!

          MARGARET                                                           RICHARD
          What?                                                              What?
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          The whole kit and caboodle.
          Margaret gives both these women a look that says "what are you
          talking about?"

          DEBBIE
          When Gilber-something told us you were
          getting married...

          GRANDMA ANNIE

          

          

          

          

          29.

          DEBBIE
          ...God rest their souls...

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          ...or friends...

          DEBBIE
          ...we decided to give you a wedding.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Engagement party tonight...

          DEBBIE
          ...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight.
          Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks.

          MARGARET
          Are you witches?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Just quaint.   During the solstice it's good
          luck.   It's an Alaskan thing.

          DEBBIE
          We've planned everything.
          Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          I'm old, Margaret.   I don't have much time
          left.   Richard lives so far away, and I
          never see him.   Now I find out he's getting
          married, and I have a chance to see my one
          grandchild's wedding day.   It's a dream come
          true for me.   A dream come true.   Please let
          me see Richard get married before I die.
          Please.
          Long beat.   Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.
          Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.   Finally,
          she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up.
          The crowd cheers.

          EXT. SITKA - DAY

          A procession of cars makes its way through town.

          INT. PICKUP - DAY

          Debbie and Grandma sit in the front of the truck, all smiles.
          Margaret and Richard sit as far away from each other as possible
          in the backseat of the extended cab.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          Margaret tries to get Richard's attention, but he's looking out
          the window.   Finally she pinches him and Richard jumps. He gives
          Margaret a "what did you do that for" look.

          MARGARET

          (MOUTHING)
          The Dragon Lady!?
          Richard shrugs.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the
          plans made already for my birthday.   Just a
          few changes here and there, and we made this
          weekend a wedding.
          Margaret stares at Richard.

          MARGARET
          I'm a lucky woman.
          Margaret does her best to smile.

          EXT. DOCK - DAY

          The cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere, near a small
          dock.   Everyone gets out of the cars and starts walking to the
          ocean.   Margaret is confused.

          MARGARET
          I'm not getting out of this car until you
          tell me where we're going.

          RICHARD
          Come on, it'll be OK.   I promise.
          Richard points to a small island about a mile away.

          EXT. YACHT - DAY

          Everyone rides on a 75 foot yacht.   Lots of polished wood and
          chrome.   Someone passes out beers on board, and the mood is
          festive.   Margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene.

          MARGARET
          Who are you people?
          Richard lets Margaret wonder.

          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY

          The ship docks and we get our first glimpse of the Paxton Estate.
          It sits above the rest of the wooded island and is as tasteful as
          a 15 bedroom Alaskan mansion can be.
          Richard's father, GEOFFREY (60) waits on the dock. He is a bear

          

          

          

          

          31.

          GEOFFREY
          So you must be Margaret.   We've heard a lot
          about you.   All of it bad.
          Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical
          sling backs.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          I mean, I almost shit myself when I heard he
          was marrying the devil woman.

          MARGARET
          I thought it was the dragon lady?

          GEOFFREY
          Either way.

          RICHARD
          Hey dad.
          Richard shakes his father's hand.   It's a little stiff.

          GEOFFREY
          Welcome home.   Good to see â€˜ya.

          RICHARD
          You too.

          GEOFFREY
          Been a while.

          RICHARD
          Yeah.   You'd think you could make it to the
          airport to mark the occasion.
          Grandma Annie interrupts.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Help him with the bags Geoffrey.
          (to Richard and Margaret)
          Let's get you two settled.
          As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots
          Geoffrey a look that says "be nice".

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          The house is decked out in sheik Alaskan decor.   Somehow, it
          makes bear heads and deer antlers look good.   Everything is first
          class.   Margaret is a little awe struck.

          DEBBIE
          We'll show you around later.

          MARGARET
          Uh huh.

          

          

          

          

          32.
          Out of nowhere, a small HUSKY PUPPY startles Margaret and jumps
          on her.

          DEBBIE
          Balzac!   Down!   No!
          Debbie pulls the dog off of Margaret and pushes him toward the
          kitchen.   Margaret tries to take it in stride and make small
          talk.

          MARGARET
          What a great name.   Balzac's "Lost
          Illusions" is one of my favorite novels.

          DEBBIE
          Oh.   Well, this Balzac's got epididymitis.
          Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to
          illustrate how Balzac really got his name.
          Not understanding, Margaret looks over at Balzac as he walks
          away.   Off her shocked reaction, we understand right away that
          this puppy Husky is an anatomic marvel.
          DEBBIE (cont'd)
          No one on the island wanted him when he was
          born.   We figured he deserved a home.

          GEOFFREY
          And don't let him outside, or the eagles
          will snatch him.

          RICHARD
          C'mon dad...

          GEOFFREY
          I mean it.   They come out of that
          rehabilitation center mean.   And hungry.

          RICHARD
          Don't listen to him, Margaret.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE UPSTAIRS - DAY

          Debbie opens a door for Richard and Margaret.

          DEBBIE
          You'll be sleeping here.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          The room is beautiful, right out of Architectural Digest.

          DEBBIE
          Bathroom is there, all the towels are in the
          armoire by the bed.   Just let me know if you

          

          

          

          

          33.

          MARGARET
          Thank you.   Where's Richard's room?

          DEBBIE
          Oh, we took down his "shrine" years ago.
          And don't worry, I'm under no illusion that
          you two haven't slept in the same bed
          before.   Richard can sleep here too.

          MARGARET
          Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie.

          DEBBIE
          It was her idea.   Anything to help get her a
          great grandchild.
          Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother.

          MARGARET
          Great.   You know, I've gotten used to his
          breathing at night.

          DEBBIE
          I thought so dear.
          Debbie leaves and shuts the door.   Margaret reverts back to her
          old self.

          MARGARET
          I'm about 15 seconds from bitch.

          RICHARD
          Calm down.

          MARGARET
          What is going on here?

          RICHARD
          Hell if I know.

          MARGARET
          You had no idea they knew about us getting
          married?

          RICHARD
          You think I'd bring you here if I did?

          MARGARET
          Well, we just gotta tell â€˜em.

          RICHARD
          Tell â€˜em what?

          MARGARET
          Tell â€˜em the truth.   About us.

          

          

          

          

          34.

          RICHARD
          Wrong answer.   No way.

          MARGARET
          What do you mean no way?   This is crazy.

          RICHARD
          No, crazy was lying to the federal officer.

          MARGARET
          Well I don't like this.

          RICHARD
          Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice
          to a Class C felony!   For one second could
          you not be so selfish?

          MARGARET
          Selfish?

          RICHARD
          Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you
          only worry about yourself every second of
          every day?

          MARGARET
          How is it selfish to tell the truth?

          RICHARD
          Look.   We're awful, awful people.   In the
          last forty eight hours, we've lied to...
          everyone.   We need to protect the people
          downstairs.   We can't ask these good,
          decent, not awful people to lie for us.
          Let's keep the darkside to ourselves.
          Margaret takes a second to make up her mind.

          MARGARET
          Fine.   But if we do this, you need to stop
          lying to me.

          RICHARD
          What've I lied to you about?

          MARGARET
          Why did you tell me that you were poor?

          RICHARD
          I never said that.

          MARGARET
          Well, you never told me you were rich.

          RICHARD
          When does that come up?

          

          

          

          

          35.

          MARGARET
          I don't know, how about, "Hi, my name is
          Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry."

          RICHARD
          Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you
          would have fired me if you knew.

          MARGARET
          No I wouldn't.

          RICHARD
          Come on!   You're always yammering on about
          your scrappy childhood, and how you fought
          for those soccer scholarships, and how the
          rich kids made fun of you in prep school for
          working in the kitchen.   You're totally anti-
          rich.

          MARGARET
          I'm not anti-rich.

          RICHARD
          Oh yes you are!   And you know what makes it
          worse?   You have money!

          MARGARET
          I earned...

          RICHARD
          ...every penny I have.   Blah, blah, blah.
          You need new material.

          MARGARET
          Hey.   Watch it.   You're still my assistant.

          RICHARD
          You were going to promote me anyway.

          MARGARET
          Sure of that?

          RICHARD
          Nope.   Not at all.
          Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror.

          MARGARET
          Well, come on.   If we're going to do this,
          we might as well put on a show.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Downstairs, the engagement party is in full swing.   The starched
          wait staff stands out in the crowd, because the raucous party-
          goers are all dressed in flannel, T-shirts and baseball hats.

          

          

          

          

          36.
          Ponytails rule for the women, and almost all the men have shaggy
          hair and beards.   No dress code here.
          Like the house, the party is first class.   Ice sculptures melt,
          champagne is served on silver trays, and the buffet overflows
          with salmon and king crab.
          Margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some
          WELL WISHERS, Richard's parents, and Balzac.

          MARGARET
          I went to Union college in upstate New York.
          It's a small liberal arts school that no one
          has ever heard of.
          Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (looks at glass)
          Lime?

          RICHARD
          Be right back.
          Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges.   Geoffrey elbows Debbie in
          the side, "What was that?"

          WELL WISHER #1
          How long have you been with your company?

          MARGARET
          Since I graduated college.
          Richard comes back with the lime.   Margaret takes it and doesn't
          say thank you.

          RICHARD
          She's been there since she was nineteen.

          GEOFFREY
          Nineteen?   Wow.   That's how long?

          MARGARET
          Oh, who's counting...
          Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her.

          GEOFFREY
          No.   How many years is that?   Exactly.
          Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look.

          MARGARET
          Well, let me see.   That would be sixteen or
          seventeen years.   Exactly.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          GEOFFREY
          I was never good with big numbers.   That
          makes you... thirty six now?

          MARGARET
          Just turned thirty seven.   Born on May 20th.
          I'm a Taurus.
          Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Richard)
          I need some protein.

          RICHARD
          There's some salmon.
          Margaret shakes her head no.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Crab?
          Margaret nods yes.   Richard steps away to find a waiter.
          Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding.

          GEOFFREY
          Keep him on a short leash, huh?   Does he
          roll over when you whistle?
          Debbie hits Geoffrey.

          DEBBIE
          He's just being a good host.
          Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow.   For Geoffrey's
          benefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard.

          MARGARET
          Thank you, honey.   You're being so sweet.
          Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.

          RICHARD
          Uh, sure.   Honey.

          WELL WISHER #2
          So you just got some big promotion?

          MARGARET
          I'm editor in chief, now.
          Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret.

          RICHARD

          (BEAMING)
          I'm so proud of my girl.

          

          

          

          

          38.
          From behind them, a melodic, etherial VOICE interrupts.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Editor in chief?   You're marrying up,
          Richard.
          Everyone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN (26).   She is
          Grace Kelly in Patagonia and Timberland.   Adding insult to
          injury, she doesn't have eyeliner on.

          RICHARD
          Gert!?
          Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and
          spilling her tonic water on her shirt.   He doesn't notice what
          he's done, and leaves Margaret.   She's peeved.
          RICHARD (cont'd)

          (FLUSTERED)
          What are you?   What are you doing here?

          GERTRUDE
          Your dad made me come.

          RICHARD
          From Chicago?
          Gertrude laughs.   The group watches these two see each for the
          first time in years.   There is instant chemistry, and Richard has
          forgotten about Margaret completely.

          GERTRUDE
          No.   I live here now.

          RICHARD
          You what?

          GERTRUDE
          I moved back about six months ago.   I'm
          teaching second grade.   At Baranof.

          RICHARD
          Did your husband move up here too?

          GERTRUDE
          Uh, no.   I, ah, got divorced.

          RICHARD
          Oh my God.   I'm sorry.

          GERTRUDE
          Me too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna
          meet the bride.
          Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret.

          

          

          

          

          39.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Hi, I'm Gertrude.   But call me Gert.

          MARGARET
          You're a Gertrude?

          GERTRUDE
          A family name from hell.

          MARGARET
          I'm sure it's been a curse.

          GEOFFREY
          Gert and Richard were quite the item in high
          school.
          Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence.

          GERTRUDE
          Oh Please.   Ancient history.

          GEOFFREY
          Feels like yesterday to me.

          GERTRUDE
          (ignoring Geoffrey)
          So tell me everything.   I hear it wasn't
          exactly love at first sight?

          MARGARET
          Not exactly...

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Now Richard, what I want to know is how you
          proposed.
          This grabs the group's full attention.   Everyone loves to hear a
          story like this.

          RICHARD
          Well...
          Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Uh, uh, um, I...

          GEOFFREY
          Yeah.   How did you pop the question?
          Richard is a deer in the headlights.   This is getting ugly.
          Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in.

          MARGARET
          Can I tell this one, honey?

          

          

          

          

          40.

          RICHARD
          Uh.   Sure.

          MARGARET
          I'm an early, early riser and go for a run
          everyday.   Well, it was our six month
          anniversary and I was out for my normal jog
          in the park, when who do I see in a horse
          drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting
          for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So
          I ran up to the carriage and asked him what
          was going on, and he put his finger to his
          lips and says, "shhhh."   So there I am in my
          jogging clothes, next to the most handsome
          mute in the world - have you seen him in a
          tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and
          smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later,
          we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best
          part, we're the only people in the place
          because Richard got them to open up early.
          Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just
          as the sun starts to peek above the trees,
          this beautiful man gets down on one knee,
          and says "I didn't want one more sunrise to
          go by without you knowing that you are the
          light of my life, and that I would be the
          luckiest man in the world if you would be my
          wife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry
          me?"
          The group is silent, waiting for the clincher.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I said yes.
          The group gives a collective "ahh".   Grandma Annie takes both
          Margaret and Richard by the hand.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          You are a good boy Richard, and you make me
          very proud.   I love you Richy.

          RICHARD
          I love you too, Grandma.
          Grandma hugs the couple.   Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and
          Gertrude.

          GEOFFREY
          So did this happen before or after the INS
          agent came sniffing around?

          DEBBIE
          What is wrong with you?   I'm sorry Margaret.
          Margaret doesn't miss a beat.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          MARGARET
          Oh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my
          lawyers have been dealing with all of this.
          When you told us at the airport it was the
          first time I'd heard about it.   I'm so
          embarrassed.

          DEBBIE
          Don't be, dear.   Geoffrey's just an ass.
          While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink
          that says "I've got this under control".   The moment is
          interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He
          takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear.

          RICHARD
          Margaret Mill's phone.
          (off answer)
          One second please.
          Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          It's our friend, Frank.
          Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem.

          MARGARET
          Excuse me, I'll just be a second.
          Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that
          lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't
          notice Balzac follow her outside.

          EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear.   Balzac
          follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him.

          MARGARET
          Don't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the
          wishy washy writer who changes his mind
          every two seconds.
          Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING
          to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking.
          Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the
          phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Balzac)
          Sit and be quiet!
          Balzac sits and pouts.   Margaret walks away and puts the phone
          back to her ear.

          

          

          

          

          42.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I fired Bob because he didn't have your best
          interest in mind.   Our job is to help you
          succeed.   He wasn't doing that.
          Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she
          notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not
          sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him
          peacefully sit in the grass.
          She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret
          shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when --
          WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and
          takes off.   Margaret jumps.
          There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle.
          She stays calm on the phone.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Could you hold on just a second?
          With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the
          eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and
          Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened.
          Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone
          and picks it up.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (NONCHALANT)
          Sorry, dropped my phone.
          Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in
          circles above her.   She decides to wrap up the call quick and get
          back to the house.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything.
          But know this.   This book is your legacy...
          Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac
          again.   She runs.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to
          introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me-
          tomorrow-with-your-decision.   My-phone is-
          always-on.   Talk-to-you-soon.
          The eagle bears down on them with talons out.   Just as the eagle
          is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone
          to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs
          Margaret's phone and flies off.   Margaret freaks.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          

          

          

          

          43.
          Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the
          eagle as an offering.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Take the dog!   Take the dog!

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE

          Inside, the elegant party carries on.

          DEBBIE
          Where's Margaret?   We need to go.

          RICHARD
          Go where?

          DEBBIE
          It's a surprise.   Girls are going into town.
          And the boys stay here.   I told you, we've
          planned everything.

          RICHARD
          Um.   She's outside.
          Debbie and Richard turn around and look out a picture window.
          They see Margaret running with Balzac above her head.

          DEBBIE
          Oh that's sweet, she's playing with my
          Balzac.

          EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY

          The eagle is long gone, but Margaret is still running with the
          dog trying to bait it back.

          MARGARET
          This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle.   C'mon,
          bring back the phone.
          Richard calls out from the house.

          RICHARD
          What are you doing?

          MARGARET
          The eagle took my phone!

          RICHARD
          Are you drunk?

          MARGARET
          Your dad was right!   The eagle tried to take
          the dog, so I saved it, then it came back
          and took my phone.

          

          

          

          

          44.

          RICHARD
          Did the dingo eat your baby, too?

          MARGARET
          Frank's going to call me on that phone.   I
          need it!

          RICHARD
          Relax.   I've got your information backed up
          on the laptop.   I'll just get you a new
          phone and switch the number.   No problem.

          MARGARET
          Oh.

          RICHARD
          Now come on.   You're going somewhere with my
          mom and the girls.

          MARGARET
          I'm not going anywhere.

          RICHARD
          You want a new phone?   You're going.

          EXT. PIONEER BAR - DAY

          The Pioneer bar is a classic Alaskan bar, decorated with pictures
          of every fishing vessel that has made Sitka its home.
          But tonight estrogen rules, as all the patrons are women CHEERING
          for an oiled, toned, and BEARDED MAN in a tiny thong who gyrates
          to the beat of Prince's "Sexy Motherfucker."   On stage with the
          dancer, Margaret tries to not look miserable in her NOVELTY

          BACHELORETTE PARTY WEDDING VEIL WITH DEVIL HORNS.

          DEBBIE
          Work it Hank!

          GERTRUDE
          Is that a salmon down your pants?
          The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from
          Margaret's face.   Margaret remains straight faced.

          MARGARET
          Definitely not a salmon.
          The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his
          wiggling ass and gives her a feel.   She can't help but give and
          embarrassed smile.   Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the
          splits.   Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation.
          Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek.   She
          begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand.

          

          

          

          

          45.

          HANK
          Ah, ah, ah.   I was just the warm up.
          Hank sits Margaret down, and blindfolds her with a scarf.

          MARGARET
          What's going on?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Just sit there dear.

          MC
          Don't be shy ladies, tip well and often,
          show Hank how much you appreciate his
          assets!   And now... Ramone!
          The room goes silent as a middle aged RAMONE comes on to the
          stage.   He has a pot belly, threadbare thong and a thin mustache.
          Ramone's dance has a Latin theme to it, and he's very good at it.
          Margaret is oblivious.

          MARGARET
          What's that smell?
          Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about
          an inch away from her face.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (belly laugh)
          Ahhh!!!
          Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone.
          After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger
          at her naughty behavior.

          RAMONE
          You are a naughty devil.
          Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns,
          Margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies.

          MARGARET
          Good lord.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Ramone was the only male dancer on the
          island for years. No one has the heart to
          tell him to hang it up.

          MARGARET
          Want me to do it?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Thank you dear, but let's keep it our
          secret.

          

          

          

          

          46.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - SHORELINE - DAY

          Snow capped mountains watch 20 MEN in short sleeves hit golf
          balls into the ocean.   Green pontoon rafts bob in the water, made
          up to look like golf greens.   Golf balls are stacked in pyramid
          formations at every hitting area.
          Richard comes down from the house to join the group.   Geoffrey
          jokes with MR. MAGUIRE (60's, good natured) as they hit balls.

          GEOFFREY
          ...yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that
          dissolve in the water.

          MAGUIRE
          How does she come up with this shit?

          GEOFFREY
          She just does.   I stopped trying to figure
          out how.
          Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way.   Mr.
          Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is.

          MAGUIRE

          (JOKING)
          I'm mad at you, son!

          RICHARD
          Why's that, Mr. Maguire?

          MAGUIRE
          You fly up here and don't call me?

          RICHARD
          Sorry â€˜bout that.

          MAGUIRE
          What good is me owning an airline if I can't
          give you free tickets?

          RICHARD
          You're right.   Don't know what I was
          thinking...

          MAGUIRE
          Damn, straight.   Don't let it happen again!
          (hands Richard a golf club)
          Here, you take over.   This game is for
          pussies, I'm getting a drink.
          Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with
          one another for the first time.   Things are awkward between
          father and son, and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid
          conversation.   Geoffrey finally makes small talk.

          

          

          

          

          47.

          GEOFFREY
          Maguire's stepping down in January.   He's,
          uh, handing things over to Matty.
          Richard gives his dad a look.   He knows where this is going.

          RICHARD
          That's great for them.

          GEOFFREY
          So.   How's work with you?

          RICHARD
          Good.   Busy.   You know.

          GEOFFREY
          I do.   I do.   Hey, did I tell you that we're
          opening a little office in Japan?

          RICHARD
          Congratulations.

          GEOFFREY
          We're not just a mom and pop operation
          anymore.   We're going global.

          RICHARD
          Uh-huh.
          Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second.   He's been
          thinking about this moment for a long time.

          GEOFFREY
          I could really use your help.

          RICHARD
          Dad.   Please.   I'm in New York.   Margaret's
          in New York.   We have jobs.

          GEOFFREY
          I know.   I know.   It's just...

          RICHARD

          (CHALLENGING)
          It's just what?

          GEOFFREY
          You're only a secretary.
          This pisses Richard off immediately.

          RICHARD
          Again with the secretary thing!   I've told
          you, I'm an assistant!

          

          

          

          

          48.

          GEOFFREY
          Just because you call yourself an
          "assistant" doesn't mean you're not really
          just a secretary.

          RICHARD
          Well if I'm "just a secretary", why would
          you want me up here anyway?   Sounds like
          you're doing great without me.

          GEOFFREY
          It's not like that and you know it.

          RICHARD
          Then how is it?   Explain it to me.
          Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening.

          GEOFFREY
          Last week, a man stuck his finger up my
          butt...

          RICHARD
          This man was a doctor?

          GEOFFREY
          ...and it got me thinking about you.

          RICHARD
          I'm not sure this is coming out right.

          GEOFFREY
          Just shut up for a second, okay?   I want you
          to have what I built.   But I'm running out
          of time to show you things.

          RICHARD
          Stop being so dramatic.

          GEOFFREY
          I'm not being...
          (takes a hard line)
          I need you to stop dicking around down there
          and get serious.

          RICHARD
          So this is all about what you want?

          GEOFFREY
          That's not what I said.

          RICHARD
          And me in New York with Margaret?   That
          isn't serious?

          

          

          

          

          49.

          GEOFFREY
          One day the woman is the Antichrist, and the
          next day she's the love of your life?   How
          is that serious?

          RICHARD
          Things change, dad.

          GEOFFREY

          (INDIGNANT)
          Things change?

          RICHARD
          Things change.

          GEOFFREY
          Things change?

          RICHARD
          Yes.   Things change.

          GEOFFREY
          Things change.   That's your explanation?
          Know what I think?   I think you banged your
          boss and fell in love, that's what I think.
          Some sorta mommy complex.

          RICHARD
          Nice, dad.   We gotta have these Cosby
          moments more often.   This is great.
          Richard drops his club and walks back to the house.

          EXT. PIONEER BAR - DAY

          Margaret steps outside to have a moment to herself.   She's on a
          patio overlooking the ocean.   It is late, but the sun is hanging
          just over the horizon.

          GERTRUDE
          They can be a little overwhelming, but
          they're great people.

          MARGARET
          What?   I'm just working on my tan.
          (off Gertrude's look)
          It's been a long day.
          Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging.

          GERTRUDE
          Around the solstice they don't watch the
          clock.   Pretty much party â€˜til they fall
          over.

          MARGARET

          

          

          

          

          50.

          GERTRUDE
          I actually missed it when I was in the
          states.

          MARGARET
          Chicago, right?

          GERTRUDE
          Yeah.   Since college.

          MARGARET
          And now you're back?

          GERTRUDE
          Six months now.   Call me crazy, but I love
          it.   Think I'm back for good.

          MARGARET
          Really?   I don't know.   Don't you miss...

          GERTRUDE
          Neimans?   Starbucks?   Escalators?
          Margaret laughs.   She likes this woman.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Yeah.   I miss it.   Believe me, growing up I
          never thought I'd end up divorced and back
          here teaching at my old elementary school.
          That was always Richard's plan.

          MARGARET
          For you to get divorced?

          GERTRUDE
          (smiles, remembering)
          No.   I was going to teach, he was going to
          run his dad's business.   He was like a
          little old man.   Had it all worked out.

          MARGARET
          Are we talking about the same guy?

          GERTRUDE
          What do you mean?

          MARGARET
          Well, Richard's such a player.
          Gertrude looks confused.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I mean he was a total player.   Before we
          started dating.   Six months ago.

          GERTRUDE

          

          

          

          

          51.

          MARGARET
          That surprises you?

          GERTRUDE
          Did he ever tell you why we broke up?

          MARGARET
          We don't really talk much about stuff like
          that.

          GERTRUDE
          Oh.   Well I should shut up...

          MARGARET
          No, no.   Please.   I mean, we are getting
          married.   I want to know these things.
          Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.

          GERTRUDE
          He proposed to me.   When we were seniors.
          Margaret laughs.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry.   I didn't mean to...   He proposed
          to you in high school?

          GERTRUDE
          He bought this sweet little ring, and got
          down on his knee.   It was so cute.

          MARGARET
          You must have...

          GERTRUDE
          ... freaked out?   Oh you bet.   I broke up
          with him on the spot.

          MARGARET
          I would hope so.

          GERTRUDE
          After getting rejected the first time, I
          can't imagine how hard it was for him to get
          up the courage to ask you.
          Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is
          being so honest with her.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Anyway.   The idea that my little old man
          could be a player...   It's just not the
          Richard I knew.   Good thing you're making an
          honest man of him again.

          

          

          

          

          52.
          Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in
          one swig.   She has a hard time finishing it off.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Well I'm empty.   I'm going to go get
          another.   I think I hear Ramone wrapping up,
          let's get back to the girls.

          MARGARET
          I'll be right in.
          Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean.   Gertrude goes inside.
          Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          We are awful people.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          THWACK!   An axe slams down and splits a log in two.   Hands
          quickly place another log down and THWACK!   We pull back to find
          Richard playing the role of executioner.   He's still mad after
          talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood.   Rage
          Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world.
          Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht.
          Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves.   Debbie's
          mood deflates when she sees Richard.

          DEBBIE

          (SHOUTING)
          Richard!   Honey!   Is everything OK?
          With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear
          or see the girls.
          Annie shakes her head.   Something is up.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY

          Geoffrey pets Balzac as he watches SportsCenter on a sixty inch
          plasma television.   The ladies arrive and Annie and Debbie step
          in front of the TV, blocking his view.   Margaret watches from the
          door, not sure what is going on.

          GEOFFREY
          Excuse me?   I'm watching that.

          ANNIE
          Why is Richard chopping wood?

          DEBBIE
          And don't play dumb.   What did you do?
          Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          GEOFFREY
          Nothing.   I didn't do anything... will you
          please move.
          The showdown intensifies.   Margaret excuses herself.

          MARGARET
          I am so tired.
          Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice.   He's still mad.
          Margaret just smiles.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Think I'm going to take a shower and clean
          off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for
          a great night.
          Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night.   Once
          she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey.   He
          looks genuinely unnerved.

          GEOFFREY
          Stop looking at me like that!

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite
          a sweat.     He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through
          shirt, and gets a whiff of himself.   Ew.   He stinks.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Margaret walks into the private bathroom attached to her room and
          shuts the door.   We hear her turn on the shower.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY

          Geoffrey defends himself to Debbie and Annie with great
          conviction.   Richard walks right by the fighting trio, but
          doesn't notice anyone.   He continues to listen to his iPod and
          his attention is focused on the controls, as he looks for the
          playlist "Songs I Shouldn't Like" and Charlene's hit "I've Been
          to Paradise, But I Haven't Been to Me."

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY


          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret turns off the shower, pulls back the curtain and reaches
          for a towel.   All she finds is a miniature unabsorbent decorative
          hand towel.   Shit.

          IN THE BEDROOM
          Richard enters the room smiling as Charlene sings "...I've been
          undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't

          

          

          

          

          54.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret's ears perk up.   The bathroom is a disaster because she
          has dripped water everywhere looking for a towel.

          MARGARET
          Richard, is that you?

          IN THE BEDROOM
          Richard opens the armoire next to the bed and pulls out an
          incredibly absorbent Egyptian cotton towel.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was.   Richard
          isn't there, but she sees the armoire open and the towels waiting
          for her.   How did she miss that?

          MARGARET
          Richard, are you...
          Then out of nowhere, Balzac (he followed Richard in) startles
          Margaret.

          BALZAC
          Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!
          Margaret slips on the wet floor and falls on her ass.   Her foot
          kicks the door open as she retreats from the vengeful puppy.

          ON THE BEDROOM'S DECK
          Richard is oblivious as he hangs his wet clothes over a rail on
          the deck attached to the room.   He makes sure that no one is in
          the yard, pulls down his shorts, and hangs them up as well.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Naked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret
          manages to pull herself up by the toilet.   She wants a towel
          badly, but Balzac guards the doorway.   She tries reason.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry bout the eagle.   But I saved you.
          Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily.   Margaret grabs
          the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.

          ON THE BEDROOM DECK
          Richard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is
          open.   That's weird.

          

          

          

          

          55.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat,
          ready to strike.   Balzac will not be intimidated, and continues
          to growl and not let her out of the bathroom.   Margaret knows
          that she can't hit a dog, and looks for another way out.   Then
          she spots the bathroom mat.

          IN THE BEDROOM
          Richard saunters towards the bathroom, wearing only his iPod.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Balzac puts a paw onto the bath mat.
          Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top.
          Balzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls
          hard, sliding the bath mat and Balzac to the back of the
          bathroom.   With Balzac out of the way, she runs out, closes the
          door behind her and...

          IN THE BEDROOM
          WHAM!   Margaret crashes into Richard and they fall to the floor.
          It takes a second for them to realize that they are holding each
          other buck naked.

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                        Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          The two quickly separate and spastically try to cover up.   A
          rapid fire back and forth ensues.

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          Why are you naked?                                                   Why are you wet?

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          Don't look at me!                                                    You tackled me!

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          It was the dog!                                                      You're blaming the dog again?

          MARGARET
          Will you just hand me a towel!
          Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked.   When he looks
          under the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes..
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You're flashing brain!
          Richard quickly changes positions.   Out of desperation, he pulls
          the entire comforter off the bed.   He throws it Margaret's way,
          and she wraps herself in it.

          

          

          

          

          56.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You can cover up any time!
          Richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by
          the window.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Explain yourself!

          RICHARD
          I didn't know you were home!   I was outside
          chopping wood!

          MARGARET
          You didn't hear me?

          RICHARD
          I had my iPod on!

          (CONFUSED)
          Why did you jump me?
          Richard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts.

          MARGARET
          I didn't jump you.
          (off Richard's look)
          I didn't mean to jump you.   I didn't know
          you were here.

          RICHARD
          You didn't see me?

          MARGARET
          I was running from the dog!
          Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously.

          RICHARD
          Wait.   Were you tryin' to seduce me?

          MARGARET
          Oh please!   Don't flatter yourself.

          RICHARD
          Mmm-Hmmm.

          MARGARET
          Go take a shower.   You stink.

          RICHARD
          Fine.   But don't come sneaking in there.
          You're still my boss.   That'd be sexual
          harassment.

          

          

          

          

          57.
          Richard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door.   Margaret takes
          a breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up
          again.   Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his
          neck.   He gently puts him outside their room.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          There you go, buddy.   Go on and play before
          she makes a coat out of you.
          Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom.   Without
          looking back, Richard gets the final shot.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Puppy hater.

          LATER
          Richard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find
          to create himself makeshift bed on the floor.
          Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with
          the sun still shining outside.   She gets into her bed.

          MARGARET
          I'm never gonna to get to sleep.
          Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down
          outside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and
          the room is pitch black.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh.   Well.   Thanks.
          Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two
          silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.

          RICHARD
          It was kinda weird seeing you naked.

          MARGARET
          Can we not talk about this?

          RICHARD
          I'm just saying.   It was weird.

          MARGARET
          It wasn't weird.

          RICHARD
          How was that not weird?

          MARGARET
          Because we're... like teammates.

          RICHARD
          We're like teammates?

          

          

          

          

          58.

          MARGARET
          We are teammates.   And teammates see each
          other naked in the locker room.   All the
          time.   It's not a big deal.

          RICHARD
          Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the
          bed?

          MARGARET
          Good night, Richard.
          The two lay awake in silence for another beat.

          RICHARD
          Margaret?

          MARGARET
          Yes?

          RICHARD
          Don't take this the wrong way.

          MARGARET
          Okay...

          RICHARD
          You're a very beautiful woman.
          Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard.

          MARGARET
          Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - OFFICE - DAY

          Not a creature is stirring, except for Geoffrey who creeps into
          his office.   He shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic
          oak desk.   He finds a phone number with a New York City area code
          on a piece of paper.   He dials.

          GEOFFREY
          Yes.   Mr. Gilbertson?   My name is Geoffrey
          Paxton...
          Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the
          rest of the conversation.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Margaret wakes up.   She looks over to Richard asleep on the floor
          with a blanket and a pillow.   She stares maybe a beat too long,
          before there is a KNOCK on the door.

          MARGARET
          Who is it?

          

          

          

          

          59.

          DEBBIE (O.S.)
          It's me dear.   I made you two breakfast in
          bed.   Can I come in?

          MARGARET

          (STALLING)
          Uh, sure.   Just a second.
          Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden
          sailboat to wake him up.   She hits him in the head.

          RICHARD
          What the...

          MARGARET

          (MOUTHING)
          Your mother.
          Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his
          makeshift bed.   He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts
          his arm around Margaret.

          RICHARD
          Come on in mom!
          Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls.

          DEBBIE
          Well, it's your special day.
          Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on
          the edge of the bed.   She is buzzing with excitement.
          DEBBIE (cont'd)
          You two need your energy, so eat up.   We've
          got your dress fitting, have to get the
          house ready, and then your wedding.

          RICHARD
          I gotta run into town to get Margaret a new
          phone.

          DEBBIE
          Will you pick up some champagne while you're
          there?

          RICHARD
          No problem.

          DEBBIE
          And don't be gone for too long.   Lots of
          work to be done!

          

          

          

          

          60.

          MARGARET
          You don't have to go to all this trouble.
          Really.
          Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.

          DEBBIE
          Don't be silly.   This is the biggest day of
          your life.   You are coming into this family,
          and when it's family, it's no trouble.   If
          your parents were with us, they would do the
          exact same.
          Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes.   Richard
          jumps out of bed and goes to the food.

          MARGARET

          (TOUCHED)
          Your mom is just so sweet.   I haven't had
          someone make me breakfast in bed since I was
          a little kid.
          Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll.

          RICHARD
          (mouth full)
          I wish she hadn't.   I mean she almost caught
          us.   Damn, that was close.
          Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay
          attention to Margaret.

          MARGARET
          You just take all this for granted?   Your
          family, this house...
          Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret.

          RICHARD
          (mouth full)
          I'm sorry, what?   You gotta try these.
          Margaret looks at Richard with disgust.

          MARGARET
          Why are you doing this to them?

          RICHARD
          Huh?

          MARGARET
          Why am I here?   You didn't have to bring me
          here.

          RICHARD
          You made me bring you here!   You told me I

          

          

          

          

          61.

          MARGARET
          I didn't make you do anything.   You could of
          said no.

          RICHARD
          And what?   Start over at the bottom again?
          No way.

          MARGARET
          I get why a not rich person would do this.
          But you've got everything.   It doesn't make
          any sense.

          RICHARD
          Know what?   This is none of your business.

          MARGARET
          I wish it wasn't my business.   But
          unfortunately, it has become my business,
          because I made a deal with someone I thought
          I could trust.
          Richard stares at Margaret for a beat.   He's exasperated.

          RICHARD
          You wanna know why you're here?   I'll show
          you why you're here.

          MARGARET
          Fine.

          RICHARD
          We leave in a half hour.

          MARGARET
          I'll be ready in 20 minutes.
          Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it
          down on the plate.   She goes to her suitcase and looks for
          clothes.   A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          These are really good.
          She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves.

          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY

          Richard and Margaret board the yacht.   They wear athletic clothes
          and running shoes.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY

          Richard drives the yacht and Margaret sits by herself.

          

          

          

          

          62.

          EXT. PAXTON SEAFOODS PIER - DAY

          Richard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier.   Located in
          the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large
          warehouses, and buzzes with activity.   Fishing boats line the
          pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be
          processed.   Everything is clean and organized.
          Richard and Margaret walk down the pier.   He points to the SEALS
          that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps.   Damn, they're cute.
          Richard waves hello to WORKERS.   An elderly Phillipino man, BEK
          BEK, yells at them as he walks into a warehouse.

          BEK BEK
          Hey, Richard!   That the lucky lady?

          RICHARD
          Yes sir, it is!

          BEK BEK
          (to Margaret)
          You look much younger than everyone says.

          MARGARET
          That's great to hear.

          RICHARD
          See ya on the line, Bek Bek.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          Richard opens a locker and points.   We don't see at what.

          RICHARD
          Put this on.   I'll meet you outside.

          MARGARET
          But I don't...

          RICHARD
          Ah.   Put it on.

          EXT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          Margaret opens the door with a sour look on her face.   She's
          wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing
          boots, and gloves.

          MARGARET
          Is this really necessary?

          RICHARD
          You'll thank me later.
          Richard walks towards the warehouse.   Margaret follows in her

          

          

          

          

          63.

          INT. SLIME LINE - DAY

          Inside one of the brightly lit warehouses, workers at different
          stations process the fish that come off the boats.
          At the top of the line, Bek Bek is HANDCUFFED to the head
          decapitator machine.   He happily feeds whole salmon into a
          guillotine, where the heads are chopped off.   He awkwardly waves
          when he sees Margaret and Richard.

          MARGARET
          Why is he handcuffed to the machine?

          RICHARD
          So his hands don't go too far.   So he
          doesn't...
          Richard makes a chopping motion.   Margaret winces.

          MARGARET
          Nice.
          From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where
          their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You know, I shouldn't be here.   I was a
          vegetarian for six months in college.
          Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long
          line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are
          frozen.   With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller
          line and clean out all the left over intestines.

          WORKER
          There he is!   Big city boy come to show us
          how its done.

          RICHARD
          Ah, it's been a while.

          WORKER
          C'mon.   Show her how we do it.

          RICHARD
          Okay, okay.
          Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line.   Richard expertly
          demonstrates with a knife.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you
          don't want to bruise it.   Open her up, tilt
          the knife, and then pull with the grain of
          the fish.   Two quick stokes to clear the
          organs attached to the spine.

          

          

          

          

          64.
          Margaret looks nauseous.   Richard enjoys her discomfort.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the
          blood out of the vein.   Then send her down
          the line.
          Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before
          offering a knife to Margaret.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Wanna try it?
          Margaret doesn't say anything.   All the other workers watch.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          If it's too gross for you...

          MARGARET
          Gimme that.
          Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish.
          Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible
          between her and the salmon.

          RICHARD
          I did this for five summers.   Dad wanted me
          to earn my stripes before I took over.

          MARGARET
          Is that why you're still pissed at him?

          RICHARD
          Nah, I loved it here.

          MARGARET
          (re: fish guts)
          You loved this?

          RICHARD
          The slime line?   Hell no.   Nobody loves the
          slime line.   I loved this place.   The
          people.   Growing up, running this place was
          all I wanted.
          Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish.

          MARGARET

          (DISGUSTED)
          You wanted this?

          RICHARD
          I wanted to run this place. It was
          comfortable here.   It was what I knew.
          (re: fish)
          Don't forget the spine.

          

          

          

          

          65.

          MARGARET
          I wasn't gonna forget.
          Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on
          its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence.

          RICHARD
          But then things changed.   And it wasn't so
          comfortable anymore.

          MARGARET
          What kind of things changed?

          RICHARD
          Stuff.

          MARGARET
          (as if she didn't know)
          You mean, like, Gertrude?

          RICHARD
          Yeah...
          Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Oh my god.   She told you didn't she?

          MARGARET

          (INNOCENT)
          Told me what?
          Richard is embarrassed.   He turns away.

          RICHARD
          About the... you know.

          MARGARET
          The creepy teenage proposal?

          RICHARD
          Ah, shit!

          MARGARET
          You were a freak by the way.

          RICHARD
          OK, get it all out.

          MARGARET
          And she was right to break up with you.

          RICHARD
          You done?
          Margaret nods yes.

          

          

          

          

          66.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I know now that it was the right thing, but
          it screwed me up for a little while.

          MARGARET
          For a little while?   Don't sell yourself
          short.

          RICHARD
          When Gert crushed my heart into little
          pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great
          anymore.

          MARGARET
          So you moved to the open arms of New York
          City?

          RICHARD
          At first it was about getting as far away
          from this place as possible, but then I fell
          in love with it.

          MARGARET
          With scheduling my pilates?

          RICHARD
          With editing.   See, as an only kid I'd
          always read a lot, but until I worked for
          you I didn't love it.   I mean, when I
          realized that we could find the next
          Cuckoo's Nest, or Catch 22, or...

          MARGARET
          (with reverence)
          ...To Kill a Mockingbird.   It's all about To
          Kill a Mockingbird.

          RICHARD
          Exactly!   We could find the next To Kill a
          Mockingbird.   God damn, how great is that?
          Margaret smiles.   She never knew that Richard had this kind of
          passion for the job.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          So when I tell my folks that I want to spend
          my life finding books?   My dad goes ape
          shit.                                                             "How dare you forsake your family...
          you'll come crawling back to us... you're
          nothing without our help."   I left that
          night and we didn't talk for a year.
          Haven't been back here since.

          MARGARET
          So we're "getting married" so you can give
          daddy the finger?

          

          

          

          

          67.

          RICHARD
          No.
          Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving look.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Sorta.   OK, Yes.   Coming back here with
          you...   I get the promotion and I get to
          show off.   You're editor in chief.   You make
          a good prop.

          MARGARET

          (SMILING)
          I guess that's a compliment.

          RICHARD
          So now you know I'm a petty asshole.   Am I
          trustworthy again?

          MARGARET
          Oh yeah, we're good.   By the way, you're
          more screwed up than I am, Paxton.

          RICHARD
          Yeah.   Thanks.

          MARGARET
          One more question...

          RICHARD
          Yes, everyone at work thinks you're a
          lesbian.

          MARGARET
          That wasn't my question.

          RICHARD
          I know.   Just lashing out.
          Margaret smiles.

          MARGARET
          Can we stop gutting fish?   I need my phone.

          INT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY

          Richard and Margaret enter the well appointed general store,
          filled with food, booze and electronics.   A mini Wal Mart.

          RICHARD
          Hey Ramone.

          RAMONE
          Hey Richard.   Hola mi amo.
          Margaret recognizes Ramone, the male dancer from last night.

          

          

          

          

          68.

          MARGARET

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Hey.
          They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You know him?

          RICHARD
          He was my shop teacher.

          MARGARET
          Of course he was.   How many people are on
          this island?
          They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne.

          RICHARD
          Like eight thousand?   Depends on the time of
          the year.

          MARGARET
          Feels smaller.
          With the cart full they head to the checkout.

          RICHARD
          (to Ramone)
          You got the phone I called about?

          RAMONE
          Charged up, ready to go, number changed.
          Ramone throws Richard a phone.

          RICHARD
          Thanks, Ramone.

          RAMONE
          No problem.
          Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave.   She awkwardly waves back.
          Richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay.
          Margaret is confused.

          EXT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Richard keeps pushing the cart, Margaret catches up.

          MARGARET
          Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff?

          RICHARD
          It's our stuff.

          

          

          

          

          69.
          Richard points to the "Paxton General Store" sign.

          MARGARET
          That must have been handy in High School.

          RICHARD
          You have no idea.

          MARGARET
          Should you leave the cart?

          RICHARD
          It's our cart.   I didn't know you were such
          a prude.

          MARGARET
          I've come to realize that being my assistant
          gave you more access to my life than I ever
          imagined, but there are a few things you
          don't know about me.

          RICHARD
          I doubt it.   When I started, you were still
          wearing those Ugg boot things.

          MARGARET
          (deadly serious)
          I told you never to talk about that.

          RICHARD
          I'm just saying it's been a long time.   I
          know it all.
          Margaret turns on her new phone.   It searches for a signal.

          MARGARET
          (up to the challenge)
          Did you know I took disco lessons in the
          sixth grade?

          RICHARD
          Where?

          MARGARET
          The Y.

          RICHARD
          Margaret 1, Richard 0.

          MARGARET
          Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang.

          RICHARD
          At Woodstock?

          

          

          

          

          70.

          MARGARET
          I won tickets on the radio and saw them at
          the fair.

          RICHARD
          What'd they sing again?

          MARGARET
          You know.

          (SINGING)
          Cherish the love we have, we should cherish
          the life we live...
          Richard shakes his head.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Well they were good.

          RICHARD
          You had a lot of soul there, Canada.

          MARGARET
          I really like "The O.C.".   Not fake, ha, ha
          isn't it funny I like this trash.   I really
          like it.

          RICHARD
          Wow.   I'm getting shut out here.

          MARGARET
          Allergic to pine nuts.

          RICHARD
          Knew that.

          MARGARET
          Afraid of penguins.

          RICHARD
          Huh.

          MARGARET
          Haven't slept with a man in a year and a
          half.

          RICHARD
          Holy shit!   You are a lesbian!
          A MOTHER walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty
          look.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (to mother)
          My bad.
          The mother walks on.   Margaret is mortified and walks faster.

          

          

          

          

          71.

          MARGARET
          Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that
          gets a Holy shit?   I've been busy!

          RICHARD
          That's a really long time.

          MARGARET
          That hurts coming from Mr. Magic Pants.

          RICHARD
          I knew it had been slow going, but I figured
          there was a booty call in there somewhere.

          MARGARET
          Yeah, well, I'm not good at that.

          RICHARD
          I find that hard to believe.

          MARGARET
          No, not that.   I'm great at that.   Aces.
          Top notch.

          RICHARD
          I'll have to take your word for it.

          MARGARET
          Yes.   You will.

          RICHARD
          How, exactly, do you define top notch?
          Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone.   In
          an instant, she's all business.

          MARGARET
          I need a computer and the internet.   Now.

          INT. FISHERMAN'S NET INTERNET CAFE - DAY

          Designed to attract tourists, the Fisherman's Net is awash in bad
          nautical props and fishing gear.   A bored TEENAGE CLERK in a
          PIRATE OUTFIT greets Margaret and Richard.

          PIRATE
          Aye lassie, welcome to the cyber seas.   Our
          T-1 line is faster than a clipper ship in a
          hurricane, but for now ye be needing to
          scrawl your mark on this sign up sheet.
          Margaret looks and sees that all the computers are taken.

          

          

          

          

          72.

          MARGARET
          No, no, no.   I need on now.   I've got a
          Booker prize winning author demanding I send
          him an e-mail in the next forty five minutes
          explaining why he should stay with a
          publishing house that "makes" him do
          publicity.
          The Pirate looks at Margaret like she's speaking Chinese.

          PIRATE
          Arrgh...

          MARGARET
          Listen to me asshole...
          The Pirate looks around to make sure his boss can't hear.

          PIRATE
          Look lady.   You gonna put your name down on
          the list or not?
          Margaret is about to throttle the Pirate, when Richard pulls her
          back.

          RICHARD
          C'mon.   I got an idea.
          Richard leads Margaret to the door.   As they are leaving Margaret
          shouts out.

          MARGARET
          I didn't know there were a lot of pirates in
          Alaska!

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OFFICE - DAY

          Margaret sits at a computer, furiously opening her e-mail.
          Richard has brought her to his elementary school, where he and
          his old principal, MRS. WHITING, stand over Margaret.

          MRS. WHITING
          I'm so excited about the wedding!

          RICHARD
          Thanks for letting us use your computer.

          MRS. WHITING
          No problem.
          (to Margaret)
          So what flowers are you going with?
          Margaret turns around annoyed, but manages to keep her cool.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry, but could I have a minute alone

          

          

          

          

          73.

          MRS. WHITING
          Oh.   Sure.

          RICHARD
          Show me around will you Mrs. Whiting?   It's
          been years.

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALL - DAY

          Richard and Mrs. Whiting walk around the elementary school.

          MRS. WHITING
          Do you think she'll be long?   I've got work
          to do.

          RICHARD
          She'll be out of there in two shakes.
          Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a
          class of second graders.   He stops transfixed.

          MRS. WHITING
          (re: Gertrude)
          We are so lucky to have her.   Mr. Megher
          really left us shorthanded when he ran off
          in the middle of the school year.   He's
          living out in the forest now with his
          wolves.   Full time.
          Richard hasn't heard anything that Mrs. Whiting has said.   He's
          hypnotized by Gertrude.   She looks happy teaching these kids, and
          they hang on her every word.
          MRS. WHITING (cont'd)
          Will you excuse me?   The bell is about to
          ring, I need to get ready for recess.

          RICHARD
          (not paying attention)
          Uh, sure.
          Mrs. Whiting leaves.   Richard goes to the door and Gertrude sees
          him.   Good lord can that woman smile.   She waves him in.

          INSIDE THE CLASSROOM
          The kids all turn to see Richard when he opens the door.

          GERTRUDE
          Class, this is my old friend Richard.

          CLASS
          (all together)
          Hi Richard!

          

          

          

          

          74.

          GERTRUDE
          Richard and I used to be in this very same
          classroom together.   We even had your old
          teacher, Mr. Megher.

          CHILD #1
          Mr. Megher smelled like farty eggs!
          The class giggles.

          GERTRUDE
          That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick.
          The BELL RINGS.   One girl gets up.   Gertrude eyeballs her.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Marcia?

          CHILD #2
          Sorry.
          The child sits back down.   Gertrude waits a beat.

          GERTRUDE
          OK, everyone is excused for recess.
          All the kids pop up and head to the door.   Mrs. Whiting directs
          traffic outside.   Richard makes his way to Gertrude.

          RICHARD
          Patrick's right.   He did smell like eggs.

          GERTRUDE
          It's still not a nice thing to say.   And
          actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog
          and...
          (makes smoking pot motion)
          ...Matanuska Thunderfuck.   But let's keep
          that between us.

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OFFICE - DAY

          Margaret reads over her e-mail to Frank.

          MARGARET

          (READING)
          I give you my word as an editor and a
          friend...
          The door opens suddenly, and Margaret SHOUTS.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (STERN)
          Five more minutes!   Please!

          

          

          

          

          75.
          Margaret turns to find a PIG TAILED GIRL in the doorway.
          Terrified.   She SHRIEKS and runs off.   Margaret wants to
          apologize, but needs to keep working.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (WEAKLY)
          Sorry.

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

          Gertrude and Richard wipe down the chalk boards together.   They
          are very comfortable together and have an easy rapport.

          RICHARD
          Remember when Mr. Megher made us do this
          after school for a week?

          GERTRUDE
          That was your fault.

          RICHARD
          Was not!

          GERTRUDE
          You tried to kiss me.   A girl has to defend
          herself.

          RICHARD
          C'mon!
          (Tom Cruise ala Top Gun)
          I had the shot.   I took it.
          Gertrude rolls her eyes.   She's heard this a hundred times.

          GERTRUDE
          No Top Gun.   Please.

          RICHARD
          What?   You loved my Top Gun.

          GERTRUDE
          No.   You loved your Top Gun.   I just smiled
          and laughed like a good girlfriend.

          RICHARD
          That's right.   Ice... man.   I am dangerous.
          Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise.
          Gertrude is not impressed.

          GERTRUDE

          (LAUGHING)
          Really.   Stop.

          RICHARD
          That cuts deep.   I'll have you know that

          

          

          

          

          76.
          Talk of Margaret immediately shuts Gertrude down.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (noticing her change in mood)
          Uh, is something wrong?

          GERTRUDE
          No.   Nothing's wrong.

          RICHARD
          It's been awhile, but I can still tell when
          something's wrong with you.
          Gertrude doesn't want to say anything.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          What is it?   You know I hate it when you get
          all quiet.

          GERTRUDE
          I wish there was a better way to say this.

          RICHARD
          Better way to say what?

          GERTRUDE
          I made a huge mistake.   With you.   Breaking
          up with you.   I'm sorry.

          RICHARD
          Are you apologizing for high school?

          GERTRUDE
          Yes.

          RICHARD
          Oh, thank God.   I thought this was like,
          something big.

          GERTRUDE
          This is something big.

          RICHARD
          I coulda used this about five years ago, but
          I'm all good now, promise.   Thank you for
          saying that, though.
          Gertrude sees that Richard isn't getting her point.   She pulls
          herself together.

          GERTRUDE
          I think...
          (looking down)
          I want you back.

          RICHARD

          

          

          

          

          77.

          GERTRUDE
          (more to herself)
          Oh God, he's making me say it again.
          (looking at Richard)
          I want you back.   Like... we should be
          together.   All the time.

          RICHARD
          Whoa, whoa, whoa.   Rewind.

          GERTRUDE
          I know this isn't the best time to bring
          this up.

          RICHARD

          (RHETORICAL)
          My wedding day isn't the best time for you
          to bring up the idea of us dating?
          Richard's reaction stings, and Gertrude begins to well up.
          Bringing this up is very hard for her.

          GERTRUDE
          I'm not talking about dating!   You should
          move back here.   We can have the life you
          always talked about in High School.   I'm
          ready for that now.

          RICHARD
          Why are you doing this?

          GERTRUDE
          I know that the timing here sucks.   But we
          are meant to be together.   I know it.   I
          think you know it too...

          RICHARD
          No, I don't.   I don't know it.
          Richard begins to pace.   Not sure what to say.   Every time he
          opens his mouth, he can't find the words.
          Then, from the door, an interruption.

          MARGARET
          Hey guys.
          Holy shit.   Did Margaret hear anything?   Her face gives nothing
          away.   Gertrude and Richard act like nothing just happened, but
          look guilty as hell.

          GERTRUDE
          Oh.   Hey Margaret.

          RICHARD
          Uh, you all done?

          

          

          

          

          78.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   We'll see what he says.

          RICHARD
          Great.   Great.

          MARGARET
          You ready to get back to the house?

          RICHARD
          Uh.   Yeah.   Uh-huh.

          MARGARET
          Well let's go.   See you at the wedding,
          Gertrude.
          Gertrude just smiles.

          GERTRUDE
          Yeah.   See you at the wedding.

          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY

          Richard and Margaret unload champagne.   Richard is still thinking
          about Gertrude and wanting to be alone.

          MARGARET
          So, what did you and Gertrude talk about?
          Richard lies.

          RICHARD
          Nothing.   About her school.   The kids and
          stuff.   Apparently my second grade teacher
          was a pot head.

          MARGARET
          That was it?   I was gone for awhile...

          RICHARD
          (cuts her off)
          Yeah.   That was it.   You know, I can do
          this.   You should really go try on the dress
          for my mom.

          MARGARET
          I was going to go for a run first, it's been
          three days since I got out, I'm feeling
          crazy.

          RICHARD
          (could care less)
          Whatever.
          Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but
          doesn't push it.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          EXT. PAXTON TRAIL - DAY

          Margaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods.   She's running
          hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's
          accumulated over the last thirty six hours.   She's lost in her
          own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop.

          MARGARET
          What now?
          Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.   She
          soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN
          dancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a
          carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as
          he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song
          that sounds centuries old.

          SHAMAN
          Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik
          pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani
          takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm.
          Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance.
          He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs.
          Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath.   He yells out again.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          Margaret, welcome!
          She looks around.   Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          Come to me, Margaret of New York.
          Nope, that's her.   She carefully steps out into the clearing.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          It is I, father Paxton.
          Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up.

          MARGARET
          What, ah, are you doing?

          GEOFFREY
          My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and
          clear my head.   As you know, things have
          been a little crazy around here.   You should
          join me.

          MARGARET
          Ya know, I've got to get back.

          GEOFFREY
          You closed minded southerners amuse me.
          Never willing to leave the nest and try

          

          

          

          

          80.

          MARGARET
          I'm a big fan of the nest.
          Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher.

          GEOFFREY
          Dance with me!   You besmirch my ways if you
          deny my circle.
          Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents.

          MARGARET
          OK, OK.   I "accept your circle."
          Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.

          GEOFFREY
          Clear your mind and follow me.
          Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body.   Margaret
          follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it.   After
          a few moments, Margaret stops.

          MARGARET
          I'm gonna head back.

          GEOFFREY
          We're not done.

          MARGARET
          I think I am.
          Margaret begins to leave.   Geoffrey calls after her.

          GEOFFREY
          Margaret?
          Margaret stops and turns around.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.   But
          I'm making an effort here.   Don't leave now.
          Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.   Geoffrey is pleased.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Thank you.
          (switching gears)
          Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik
          pifiksailiriju m 1k...
          Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and
          speeds up the dance.   Margaret is getting better, but it is still
          painfully awkward.

          

          

          

          

          81.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          ...tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut
          qangalan uarm.
          Geoffrey speeds up the dance.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Now you.

          MARGARET
          Me what?

          GEOFFREY
          Chant.

          MARGARET
          Chant what?

          GEOFFREY
          Whatever comes out, just chant.   It is the
          way.   You'll feel better.

          MARGARET
          I can't...

          GEOFFREY
          Close your eyes.   Chant.
          Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing.   Margaret closes her eyes,
          but can't figure out what to say.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Chant!

          MARGARET
          I don't know any chants!

          GEOFFREY
          Chant!

          MARGARET

          (GUTTERAL)
          Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...
          Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low
          noise.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...

          GEOFFREY
          Chant!
          The drum beat continues.

          MARGARET

          

          

          

          

          82.
          They continue to dance, Margaret is getting into it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to the wall...
          More sand.   More fire.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to sweat drop down my balls...
          Geoffrey stops dancing.   What did she say?
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to all these bitches crawl...
          Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken
          out into a â€˜Lil John song.   She continues to dance.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...To all skee skee motherfucker...
          Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...all skee skee got damn...
          From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out.

          DEBBIE
          Geoffrey!
          Margaret stops chanting â€˜Lil John.

          GEOFFREY
          Oh Debbie, I didn't do anything.
          Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Is she singing about balls?

          MARGARET
          He told me I had to chant!

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Oh, you poor dear.   Geoffrey, you can't do
          this!
          (to Margaret)
          He's an eighth Tlingit, dear.

          DEBBIE
          He does this to keep in touch with "his
          people".

          

          

          

          

          83.

          GEOFFREY
          Don't make fun of my heritage!   And it was
          helping.   Don't you feel better?   I feel
          better.

          DEBBIE
          Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned
          up.   You've got a dress to try on.   And
          Geoffrey, put that fire out and come in and
          help us with this wedding.
          Geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and
          the drum beat stops.

          GEOFFREY
          Fine.
          With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end.

          INT. PAXTON MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

          Debbie and Annie wait outside a bathroom door in a massive master
          bedroom.   They talk to Margaret through the door.

          DEBBIE
          I am so excited.   Aren't you excited?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          This was my dress from 1929.   My mother made
          it by hand.   Amazing how things come back
          into style.   How does it fit?
          Margaret speaks through the door.

          MARGARET (O.S.)
          Just buttoning up here.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Drum roll!
          Grandma and Debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds.
          Margaret opens the door and smiles.   She's unsure of herself, but
          looks fantastic.   The dress fits great, except...
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Your boobs are bigger than mine ever were.

          MARGARET
          Yeah, it's a little snug.

          DEBBIE
          Come over here.
          Debbie leads Margaret to a mirror.   Grandma Annie follows.

          

          

          

          

          84.

          MARGARET

          (ADMITTING)
          It's a lovely dress.
          Debbie looks at Margaret, and spontaneously begins crying.

          DEBBIE
          (through the tears)
          You're so beautiful, and such a great match
          for my Richard.   I know I've just met you,
          but a mother can tell.   When he looks at
          you, I can tell he's in love.   I'm so happy
          I get to share your day.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Debbie, please.   We've got work to do.

          DEBBIE
          You're right.
          Debbie collects herself, then starts crying again.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          You go work downstairs, I'll finish this.
          Debbie tries to calm down, but can't.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Go!
          Debbie nods in agreement.   Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in
          tears.   Margaret and Annie watch her go.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Had to get rid of her before I gave you
          this.   Don't think she woulda recovered.
          Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around
          Margaret's neck.   When she is done, a stunning blue necklace lays
          on Margaret's neck.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          You needed something blue.   It's silly, but
          I didn't want to take any chances.

          MARGARET
          It's beautiful.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's hematite.   Alaska diamonds.   The blue
          ones like this are very rare.   My great
          grandfather gave it to my great grandmother
          when they were married.   They were quite a
          scandal, you know.   He was Russian and she
          was Tlingit.

          85.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Back then, you had to get approval from
          every person in the tribe before you got
          married.   It almost broke them up.

          MARGARET
          How'd they stay together?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Don't know.   But I'm sure happy they did,
          none of us would be here if they hadn't.
          Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          I want you to have it.
          This is awful news for Margaret.   She might as well be stealing
          from Annie.

          MARGARET
          No, no, no.   I can't.   Really.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          I don't want to hear it.   It's yours.
          Grandmothers like to give their stuff away
          to their grandchildren.   Makes us feel like
          we'll always be a part of your life, even
          after we're gone. Take it.
          Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time
          feels like a complete and total fraud.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Are you feeling all right, dear?
          Margaret doesn't speak.   Annie patiently waits for her reply.

          MARGARET
          Well.   Thing is...
          Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...the dress is just a little tight.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Oh, don't worry about that.   We've got these
          seams by the arm, this'll be easy.
          Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          We can fix this no problem.
          Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard helps WORKERS build a stage for the band.   He's still in
          a foul mood when Margaret interrupts in a panic.

          MARGARET
          We need to talk.

          RICHARD
          I'm a little busy.

          MARGARET
          Well I'm freaking out.   I need to get away
          from here.   From everyone.   Now.

          RICHARD
          Go for another run.

          MARGARET
          No!   I did that.   It did not help.

          RICHARD
          I'm a little tired of you making demands and
          me just jumping...

          MARGARET
          (re: wedding stuff)
          We're not going to need any of this if I
          don't get out of here.

          RICHARD
          OK, high maintenance.   Let's go.

          EXT. PAXTON SPEED BOAT - DAY

          Unlike the bulky yacht, this boat is built for speed and
          maneuverability. Richard starts her up.

          MARGARET
          Move over, I'm driving.
          Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel.

          RICHARD
          You don't know where we're going.
          Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off.

          MARGARET
          It doesn't matter.

          ON THE OPEN OCEAN
          Margaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the
          horizon.

          

          

          

          

          87.
          As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees,
          blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the
          coastline have a calming effect on both of them.   In Alaska, it
          doesn't take long to leave humanity behind.
          Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep
          mountain walls on either side.   Although it is still warm out, an
          icy beach can be seen straight ahead.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Where are we?

          RICHARD
          The north pole.   Congratulations, we made
          it.
          (off Margaret's look)
          It's a glacier.   Tracy's Arm.   You better
          let me take it from here.

          MARGARET
          I'm fine.

          RICHARD
          Oh.   OK.   So like me, you've navigated a lot
          of glacier fields?   And not died?
          Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Lady, you've got issues.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   I'm a control freak.   Fine.

          RICHARD
          It doesn't stop there.

          MARGARET
          This coming from the sociopath.

          RICHARD
          Oh, please.

          MARGARET
          I'd never bring me here.

          RICHARD
          You drove!

          MARGARET
          I mean to Alaska.

          RICHARD
          Are you kidding me?
          Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.

          

          

          

          

          88.

          MARGARET
          You're sick.   Doing this to them.

          RICHARD
          I explained to you...

          MARGARET
          They love you.   Do you get that?

          RICHARD
          Of course.

          MARGARET
          And you're still willing to lie to them?

          RICHARD
          Like you didn't know.

          MARGARET
          Didn't know what?

          RICHARD
          That we were going to lie to them.

          MARGARET
          I didn't know!

          RICHARD
          Well that makes you either stupid, or
          ignorant.

          MARGARET
          You think I'm stupid?

          RICHARD
          No, but what's behind door number two...

          MARGARET

          (SCREAMS)
          I forgot!   OK?   I forgot!

          RICHARD
          Forgot what?

          MARGARET
          What it was like!

          RICHARD
          What what was like?

          MARGARET
          To have a family!   I forgot what it was like
          to have a family.   I've been on my own since
          I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was
          like to have people that love you, and make
          you breakfast, and give you necklaces...

          

          

          

          

          89.
          Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of
          breath.   She goes to the side of the speed boat.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I'm going to take a walk.

          RICHARD
          We need to head back...

          MARGARET
          Alone.   I need alone time.

          RICHARD
          What?
          Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look.

          MARGARET
          I'm, uh, about to lose my shit.   Big time.
          I need a second.

          RICHARD
          But...

          MARGARET

          (PANICKED)
          Stop right there!
          Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I'm going to be over there.   Away from you.
          Just sit down, turn around, and act like
          you're not here.
          Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down
          and turn around.   He does.   Margaret gets off the boat and walks
          away from him on the glacier.

          ON THE GLACIER
          Margaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (manic, to herself)
          You can do this.   Couple more hours, and
          then you'll never see these people again.
          Eventually you'll write a letter.
          Apologize.   Send the necklace back.

          RICHARD
          (from the boat)
          Margaret!

          MARGARET
          No talking!

          

          

          

          

          90.

          RICHARD
          (from the boat)
          Watch your step, OK?   It can be dangerous.

          MARGARET
          Again, you're not supposed to be...
          Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.

          ON THE BOAT
          Richard sits with his back turned to Margaret, waiting for her
          reply.   He doesn't hear anything.   That's weird.

          RICHARD
          (back still turned)
          Margaret?
          Richard turns around and looks for Margaret.   He doesn't see her.
          He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the
          direction he last saw Margaret.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Margaret?   I know I'm breaking "the rules"
          here, but where are you?
          He takes one more step before he hears...

          MARGARET (O.S.)

          (YELLING)
          Richard!!!!!!!!   Help!!!!!!!!
          Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her
          voice.   He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that --
          Margaret's been swallowed by the ice.   Her upper torso sticks out
          of the glacier, held up by her arms.   Her eyes are wide, and
          she's almost hyperventilating.     It's a bizarre sight.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh, thank God!
          Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.
          Margaret is really scared.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?

          RICHARD
          I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   Just relax.   I'll
          get you out of there.   You've broken through
          an ice bridge.   It happens all the time.   No
          biggie.

          MARGARET
          Don't do that.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          RICHARD
          Don't do what?

          MARGARET
          The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they
          tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to
          death that they're going to be OK.   Don't do
          that!

          RICHARD
          It's not like that.   Really.   We do need to
          be careful here though, I don't want us both
          to fall in.   Stay still, OK?

          MARGARET
          Uh-huh.
          Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the
          ice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way.

          RICHARD
          So, I'm going to walk up to you and very
          slowly pull you out.   OK?

          MARGARET
          I'm really cold.

          RICHARD
          Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded
          by ice.

          MARGARET
          (makes sense)

          OK.
          Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to
          his knee.   He calmly looks down on her.

          RICHARD
          So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits.
          I'm probably going to touch boob.   But don't
          freak out.
          Margaret shakes her head yes.   Richard reaches down and slowly
          lifts her out of the ice.   Margaret doesn't say a word.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          When I get you all the way out, I need you
          to hold onto me.   I'm going to carry you
          over there.
          Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.   He's
          strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her "over
          the threshold" style, away from the hole in the ice.   He speaks
          once they're safe.

          

          

          

          

          92.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I've, uh, never done that before.

          MARGARET
          You said it was "no biggie".

          RICHARD
          Yeah.   Well.   You OK?

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   I'm fine.
          Richard smiles.   Margaret smiles back.
          Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits
          just right.   Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (SMILING)
          You shouldn't of laughed at me.

          RICHARD
          You woulda laughed at me.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   While I was getting my camera.
          The two stare at each other for a beat.   There's a real spark.
          They might kiss.

          RICHARD
          Gertrude wants me back.
          Whoah.   Not what she was expecting.   She looks down.

          MARGARET
          And?

          RICHARD
          Well.   It seemed like you were having...
          second thoughts.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   I was.

          RICHARD
          Maybe we should do it.   Come clean.

          MARGARET
          Put me down.
          Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.   She tries to regain
          her composure.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You wanna call it off?

          

          

          

          

          93.

          RICHARD
          If you do.

          MARGARET
          Fine.   It's over.   We'll tell them when we
          get back.

          ON THE BOAT
          Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her.
          Richard drives the boat.   They don't talk.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above
          them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting
          married.   The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a
          hurry.   He's clearly been waiting.

          GEOFFREY
          Come with me.

          RICHARD
          Where's mom, dad?   We all need to talk.

          GEOFFREY
          Not now.   C'mon.
          Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do.
          Geoffrey storms off and they follow.

          EXT. PAXTON GUESTHOUSE - DAY

          Richard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the
          guesthouse.   Geoffrey stops before they go in.

          GEOFFREY
          (to Richard)
          I haven't told your mother about any of
          this, and I don't plan to.
          (to Margaret)
          I was really beginning to like you.   Sorry
          about this.
          Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside.

          INSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE
          The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court.   In the
          middle of the court, a man patiently sits on a metal folding
          chair.   It's Gilbertson.   He smiles.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Hey there kids.   Good to see ya!

          

          

          

          

          94.

          RICHARD
          (to Dad)
          What did you do?
          Geoffrey doesn't answer.   He's not proud of himself.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (getting angry)
          What did you do, dad?!

          GEOFFREY
          I called him yesterday.   He told me that you
          were lying, and that he was going to catch
          you.   That he was going to send you to
          prison.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          (to Richard)
          We made a deal and dad here flew me up.   Now
          you tell the truth, and get off scott free.
          It's like it never happened for you.

          RICHARD
          You made a deal with him?   On my behalf?

          GEOFFREY
          You were making a mistake...

          RICHARD
          That's none of your business.

          MARGARET
          It's fine.

          RICHARD
          The hell it is.   It is not fine!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Oh quack, quack, quack.   Just tell me what
          really happened, and I'll be on my way.   No
          one gets hurt, we all get what we want.
          Margaret takes Richard's hand.

          MARGARET
          It's OK.   Tell him.

          RICHARD
          (to Geoffrey)
          You do not get to make this decision.   This
          is my decision.
          (to Gilbertson)
          The truth is... I've been working for
          Margaret for three years.   Six months ago we
          started dating.   I recently asked her to
          marry me, and she said yes.   See you both at

          

          

          

          

          95.

          GEOFFREY
          What are you doing, Richard?

          RICHARD
          (grabs Margaret's hand)
          Come on, we gotta get ready.
          Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          The couple walks briskly to the house.

          RICHARD
          What was I thinking?   They act like they're
          nice, but really, they're evil.

          MARGARET
          He's only doing it because he loves you.

          RICHARD
          Are you defending him?   Are you defending
          the king dick?

          MARGARET
          Just stop.   Think about this.

          RICHARD
          Oh, I've thought about it.   And know what I
          think?   I think you saved my life.   Thank
          you, Margaret.   Getting married to you is
          the best thing that's ever happened to me.
          Without this, I might've ended up back here.
          Up at the house, Debbie opens the door.

          DEBBIE
          There you are!   You two almost gave me a
          heart attack.   C'mon, get dressed!

          RICHARD
          Coming mom!
          (to Margaret)
          Time to sack up.
          Richard winks and goes inside.   Margaret follows, not sure.

          THE WEDDING MONTAGE
          -- Chairs are set up outside.
          -- Guests arrive via boat.
          -- Richard stands on the deck, wearing his tuxedo.   Gertrude
          arrives for the wedding, and they lock eyes.   Richard waves hello
          and mouths "Sorry."   He goes back inside.

          

          

          

          

          96.
          -- Geoffrey sits in his bedroom and watches TV.   He's not dressed
          for the wedding yet.   Debbie shakes her head at him in the mirror
          as she puts on her ear rings.
          -- Gilbertson eats every hors d'oeuvre that's offered to him.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Grandma knocks on the door and comes inside.   We see Margaret
          from head to toe.   The dress, veil and flowers look amazing.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          If I were one to brag, I'd say that dress is
          perfect.

          MARGARET
          Matches the shoes.
          Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Those'll be your best friend.   Wedding shoes
          stink.   You ready?

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          With the ocean in the background, 200 GUESTS sit in white chairs.
          Richard stands under a gazebo, and smiles at his mother in the
          front row.   He ignores Geoffrey.
          Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson.
          From the gazebo, Richard nods at a GROUP OF CELLO PLAYERS, who
          begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads "Kool and
          the Gang, Cherish".   Heads turn with the start of the music, to
          see Annie walk Margaret down the aisle.
          When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles.

          MARGARET
          (mouthing to Richard)
          Nice song.
          Richard shrugs his shoulders.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Is that your song, dear?

          MARGARET
          I guess so.
          Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle.   Looking up,
          Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone.                      (Yes, the same
          guy from the liquor store and the strip club.)

          RAMONE

          

          

          

          

          97.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's me, Ramone.
          Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard.   They
          whisper while they walk up to Ramone.

          RICHARD
          You look gorgeous.

          MARGARET

          (SMILING)
          You look disgusting.

          RICHARD
          So, is this what you dreamed of when you
          were a little girl?

          MARGARET
          Oh, you bet.
          They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Ramone.

          RAMONE

          (QUIETLY)
          Mi amo.
          (To the crowd)
          We are gathered here today to celebrate one
          of life's greatest moments.   To give
          recognition to the beauty, honesty, and
          unselfish ways...
          Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's
          looking straight ahead, determined to get through this.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          ...of Richard and Margaret's true love...
          "True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the
          audience notices.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          ...before their family and friends.
          "Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and
          Geoffrey.   She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in
          order to keep himself seated.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          For it is family and friends who taught
          Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only
          right that family and friends all celebrate
          that love here today.

          

          

          

          

          98.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          And if there is anyone who has cause why
          this couple should not be united in marriage
          and love, they must speak now or forever
          hold their peace.
          Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask.
          Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention.
          He's not sure what to do.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          Mi amo, do you have a question?
          We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted
          shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself.

          MARGARET
          No.

          RAMONE
          Then why is your hand up?

          MARGARET
          I have something to say.   It's not a
          question though.

          RAMONE
          Can it wait â€˜til after?

          MARGARET
          Uh.   Um.   No.

          RICHARD
          What are you doing?
          Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd.     They
          stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner.

          MARGARET
          Hey there, folks.   Thanks for coming out.
          I've got a little announcement to make about
          the "wedding."

          RICHARD
          Don't do this.
          Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand.

          MARGARET
          Not sure the best way to tell you all this.
          But, uh... I made Richard marry me.   This is
          all a sham.
          Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air.

          

          

          

          

          99.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I was going to get kicked out of the country
          -- so I told Richard that I would destroy
          his career if he didn't marry me.

          RICHARD
          Now wait...

          MARGARET
          Richard.   Please.   Let me finish.
          (to the Paxton family)
          Richard wanted to stop this when we got off
          the plane, but I wouldn't let him.   Don't
          blame him.   This is all my fault.
          (to Ramone)
          Could you get the band started?   And give
          these people something to drink.
          (to Gilbertson)
          And you.   Meet me at your dingy in ten,
          you're taking me to the airport.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You got it!
          Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks
          back up the aisle with all eyes on her.   She stops when she gets
          to Gertrude and leans down.

          MARGARET
          Take care of him.

          GERTRUDE
          Promise.
          Margaret walks back into the house.   Alone.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Margaret's wedding dress is laid out on the bed.   Her bag is
          packed.   Richard knocks and comes in.   Margaret is on the phone.

          MARGARET
          (unenthusiastically to phone)
          Uh-huh.   Yeah.   That's great Frank.   Good
          news.   Talk to you on Monday.
          Margaret hangs up.

          RICHARD
          So Frank's back in?
          Margaret nods distractedly.   Getting Frank to do the publicity
          tour doesn't mean much right now.

          MARGARET
          Yup.   He's in.   For now.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          RICHARD
          Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird?

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   Right.
          Margaret starts collecting her bags.

          RICHARD
          Great exit back there.

          MARGARET
          Thanks.   Fun weekend.

          RICHARD
          Same old, same old, around here.

          MARGARET
          Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to
          strip the sheets, so I just left them.

          RICHARD
          I'll let her know.

          (BEAT)
          Why did you tell them all that?

          MARGARET
          It was getting too messy.   We weren't going
          to be able to keep it up.

          RICHARD
          Don't start lying to me now.
          Margaret stops for a moment.

          MARGARET
          I heard you and Gertrude at the school.   I
          think she meant what she said.   She's a
          great girl, you should stay.   It's the right
          thing.   You're perfect for each other.

          RICHARD
          But... but what about you?   What are you
          gonna do?
          Margaret wants to keep the conversation short.

          MARGARET
          Don't worry about me.   I'll survive.

          RICHARD
          So what?   This is it?

          MARGARET
          Yup.   This is it.

          

          

          

          

          101.
          Margaret walks to the door, but stops.   She turns to Richard.
          Despite her best effort to act cold, she can't help herself.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (SINCERE)
          Have an amazing life, OK?   You're a good
          person.   You deserve it.
          She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it.   It's electric, but
          Margaret denies it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Goodbye, Richard.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Margaret walks down to the dock carrying her suitcase.   She can
          hear that the party is in full swing and smiles.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY

          Gilbertson drives his little speedboat and Margaret holds her
          suitcase tight.   It's choppy, and the outboard motor is loud.
          The two have to yell to talk.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I want you to say the words.

          MARGARET
          I'm not doing great in the dignity
          department, can we not do this right now?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Say it.
          Margaret closes her eyes.   Hating that it's come to this.

          MARGARET
          I'll publish your book.
          Gilbertson smiles.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Now was that so hard?

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard sits by himself and finishes a beer by the shore.
          Gertrude walks up to him, looking fabulous, with two more beers.

          GERTRUDE
          So here's the deal.   I'm going to have a
          million questions for you tomorrow...
          Gertrude sits down next to Richard.

          

          

          

          

          102.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          ...but for now I thought we'd just sit here
          and drink beer.   OK?
          Richard nods.   Gertrude hands him a beer.

          RICHARD
          Thanks.
          Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek.   Then, realizing
          where and who he is with, he puts his beer down.   He turns to
          Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the
          lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss.
          When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed.
          Richard looks worried.   Something is wrong.

          GERTRUDE
          You have been practicing.

          RICHARD
          Waddya mean?

          GERTRUDE
          Well.   Margaret told me that you, uh, turned
          into bit of a man whore down there.
          Richard looks down.   A bit ashamed.   Gertrude makes light.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          You're gonna have to put that in check if
          you move back.   Cause me and Beth Cable are
          the only two real options up here... and
          I'll kick that bitch's ass.
          Richard gives her a polite smile.   He's not really in the mood to
          joke.   Gertrude notices.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          So no jokes yet?   Too soon?

          RICHARD
          I'm sorry.   I'm just a little... confused.

          GERTRUDE
          That kiss didn't seem "confused."
          Richard takes a beat to collect himself.

          RICHARD
          You're amazing, Gert.   And I've thought
          about being with you for a long time.   A
          long time.   When you said those things at
          the school?   I've dreamed about hearing you
          say those things.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          103.
          RICHARD                                                         (cont'd)
          But as crazy as this seems.   I know now...
          that we're just not meant to be.
          Gertrude pulls back like she's been punched.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Thing is... when I said goodbye to Margaret?
          I felt sick.   For the three years we worked
          together, I wanted to be as far away from
          her as possible.   But now that she's gone?
          I'm just really... sad.   I want her with me.
          What is that?
          The question hangs in the air.

          GERTRUDE
          I don't know.

          RICHARD
          I think I have to find out.

          GERTRUDE
          Find out what?

          RICHARD
          If she feels the same way.
          Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry.

          GERTRUDE
          Well.   OK then.   What's a girl gonna do?
          (voice cracking)
          I guess you want who you want.
          Gertrude gives a melancholy smile.

          RICHARD
          I'm so sorry.

          (BEAT)
          But, I gotta go.

          GERTRUDE
          Uh-huh.
          Richard gets up.

          RICHARD
          Are you OK?

          GERTRUDE
          I'm fine.   Really.   Go.
          Gertrude nods her approval and Richard runs off to the party.

          

          

          

          

          104.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - PARTY - DAY

          Debbie, Geoffrey and Annie sit at a table next to the bar,
          dumbstruck looks on their faces.   Ramone mixes drinks and flips
          bottles.   Richard runs up to them all, looking excited.

          GEOFFREY
          What are you so God damn happy about?

          RICHARD
          What?   Oh.   Well, I'm, uh, going to see
          Margaret.

          GEOFFREY
          What?!

          DEBBIE
          She violated you.   We should report her.

          RICHARD
          Who you gonna report her to, mom?

          DEBBIE
          Oh my God.   He's got the Stockholm syndrome.

          RICHARD
          I don't have the Stockholm syndrome.   And
          she didn't violate me.

          DEBBIE
          What is going on, Richard?
          Richard slows down and explains to his mom.

          RICHARD
          I'm sorry I lied to you.   That was an awful
          thing to do.   But it took this weekend for
          me to see how funny, and screwed up and
          perfect Margaret is for me.   I think
          she's... the one.

          DEBBIE
          But you already thought she was the one.

          RICHARD
          No, I didn't.   Not until she left.

          DEBBIE
          Really?   Does she think that too?

          RICHARD
          I don't know.   I've got to get to the
          airport to find out.
          Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile.

          

          

          

          

          105.

          DEBBIE
          (so romantic)
          He's going to stop her from leaving!   At the
          airport!

          RICHARD
          But I gotta hurry.   Her plane leaves any
          second.   I might not make it.

          DEBBIE
          (so romantic)
          He's not sure he's going to make it!

          GEOFFREY
          Are you buying this horse shit?

          DEBBIE
          Oh, Geoffrey!

          RICHARD
          I don't have time to explain this to you.

          GEOFFREY
          Well then make some god-damn time.   Cause I
          won't let you throw your life away for some
          woman.

          RICHARD
          I don't care.

          GEOFFREY
          Excuse me?

          RICHARD
          I don't care.   I love you and want you to
          understand.   But I'm not asking your
          permission here.   I'm doing this.

          GEOFFREY
          Oh, really?
          From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts.

          ANNIE
          Boys!   Stop it! Stop it!   Stop it!
          But suddenly, a look of panic flashes across Annie's face.   She
          grabs the table to steady herself, but pulls the table cloth,
          causing a loud crash.   Geoffrey and Richard run over.

          GEOFFREY
          Mom, are you OK?

          ANNIE
          I'm having a... I need to go to the
          hospital.   Fast.

          

          

          

          

          106.

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Margaret and Gilbertson board the jet together.   Margaret finds
          her seat in first class and discovers the Handsome Man from the
          flight before sitting nearby.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (re: Gilbertson)
          Is this another gay assistant?
          Margaret doesn't say anything and takes her seat.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          TWO COAST GUARDSMAN carry Annie on a gurney to their waiting
          helicopter.   Geoffrey, Richard, and Debbie follow behind.   They
          all pile into a large chopper and fly off.

          INT. COAST GUARD HELICOPTER - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          An oxygen mask covers Annie's face.   Geoffrey holds her hand.
          Annie motions for Geoffrey to come closer and he leans down.
          Geoffrey sits up and shouts over the helicopter noise.

          GEOFFREY
          Richard!   She has something she wants to say
          to us!
          Richard leans down, and joins Geoffrey and Annie.   Their three
          heads are very close together.   Annie speaks to them both through
          the oxygen mask.

          ANNIE
          Listen to me.   You two need to stop
          fighting.   You'll never see eye to eye, but
          you're family.   If this doesn't stop, one
          day you'll regret it.
          (to Geoffrey)
          Promise me you'll stand by Richard, even if
          you don't agree with him.

          GEOFFREY
          I... I promise.

          ANNIE
          And Richard.   Promise you'll work harder to
          be a part of this family.

          RICHARD
          I promise, Grandma.

          ANNIE
          OK, then.
          Annie closes her eyes.   She looks peaceful.   A moment passes.

          

          

          

          

          107.
          Then suddenly Annie takes off her mask, sits up, and yells to th
          pilot.
          ANNIE (cont'd)
          (as if nothing happened)
          I'm feeling much better.   I don't need to go
          to the hospital.   Take us to the airport,
          please.
          Richard and Geoffrey are confused.   Stunned even.

          GEOFFREY
          What... what is going on?
          (so the Coast Guard can't hear)
          Did you fake a heart attack?

          ANNIE
          We didn't have time for your squabbling, and
          I knew a helicopter would be the quickest
          way to the airport.   It seemed like the best
          way.

          RICHARD
          The best way?

          ANNIE
          And remember, you two promised me that
          you're going get along.   I wasn't kidding
          about that.

          COAST GUARD PILOT
          Ma'am, I'm not authorized to take you to the
          airport...

          ANNIE
          (to pilot)
          Larry Ferris!   Don't make me call your
          mother!

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Gilbertson talks non-stop.   Margaret is in hell.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...I want my book launch to be special.   I'm
          thinking we throw a soiree at the Nevsky
          Monastery.   In St. Petersberg?
          Margaret stares at him blankly.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          (as if she should know)
          Where Dostoyevsky is buried?   Hello?   I
          thought you were a professional...
          Margaret closes her eyes to numb the pain.

          

          

          

          

          108.

          EXT. SITKA AIRPORT - DAY

          The helicopter lands, and Richard jumps out.   His family follows
          as they run to the control tower.

          INT. AIRPORT TOWER - DAY

          CHUCK has an easy job.   Jets fly into Sitka, but there are only
          about six flights a day.   He is half awake as he radios
          Margaret's flight.   Reggae music plays in the background.

          CHUCK
          Flight 1601, you're clear for takeoff.

          PILOT (O.S.)
          Roger that, Chuck.
          The PHONE RINGS in the tower.   Chuck picks up.   Intercut as
          necessary, with Richard running on a cell phone.

          CHUCK
          Tower.   Talk to me.

          RICHARD
          Hey Chuck, it's Richard.

          CHUCK
          Hey man.   Heard about your lady bailing.
          How often does this happen to you?

          RICHARD
          Need you to do me a solid, brother.   I gotta
          see my girl and she's on that flight.   Could
          you stop it for me?

          CHUCK
          No can do brohan.   Need a good reason for
          the FAA holes.   Lose my jobby job if I
          delivered that favor.

          RICHARD
          Oh, c'mon Chuck!

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          The plane rattles as it gains speed for takeoff.   Margaret
          studies the safety pamphlet, trying to ignore Gilbertson.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...so next topic.   Celebrities.   Let's
          invite the Bill Clinton's and leave out the
          Paris Hilton's, OK?
          Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane
          leave Sitka.

          

          

          

          

          109.

          EXT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard and his family stand outside the tower and watch
          Margaret's plane take off.

          RICHARD
          Well.   That's it.   Once she gets back to New
          York, it'll be like this never happened.
          Richard looks defeated.   Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and
          takes a deep breath.

          GEOFFREY
          So, you know I think you shouldn't be with
          Margaret, right?

          RICHARD
          You've made that crystal clear.

          GEOFFREY
          Good.
          (looks at Annie)
          Well, consider this me keeping my promise.
          Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button.   He waits
          for an answer.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          (to phone)
          Hey!   Maguire!   Yeah, yeah, yeah, her
          running out was something.   But that's what
          I'm calling about.   I've got a favor to ask
          you, â€˜bout one of your planes...

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Gilbertson continues to talk.   Margaret is in a stupor.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...you know those two hundred pages I took
          out?   I'm going to put them back...
          A flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Ms. Mills?   Would you come with me?
          Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson.

          MARGARET
          Yes, of course.
          She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          What's this about?

          

          

          

          

          110.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          (never done this before)
          There's someone on the radio for you.
          The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant CB located at
          the front of the plane, outside the cockpit.
          FLIGHT ATTENDANT (cont'd)
          Uh, a Richard Paxton?
          Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat belt.

          MARGARET
          Tell him I'm not here.

          CUT TO:

          INT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard and his family are huddled around the radio in the tower.
          Chuck sits nearby.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
          (from radio)
          I'm sorry.   She won't come talk to you.

          RICHARD
          Shit!   She's never going to pick up...

          CHUCK
          (to Richard)
          Know what, home slice?   Cut this chica
          loose.   You remember Beth Cable?   She'd
          totally be into you...
          Suddenly, Richard has an idea.   He picks up the hand mic.

          RICHARD
          Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you
          ask the captain to do me one more favor...

          CUT TO:

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          DING!   The captain comes on over the loudspeaker.

          CAPTAIN
          (over plane loudspeaker)
          Welcome to flight 1601 to Seattle, this is
          your captain.   We've reached our cruising
          altitude of 30,000 feet.   Flight time'll   be
          three hours and thirty minutes.   And
          Margaret?   Richard has something he'd like
          to say to you.

          

          

          

          

          111.

          RICHARD (O.S.)
          (over loudspeaker)
          Uh, hey Margaret.   And cause I'm on the
          loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane.
          The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's
          Margaret.   Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and acts like she
          doesn't know either.
          RICHARD (O.S.) (cont'd)
          (over loudspeaker)
          This certainly isn't how I wanted to do
          this.   I mean, I'm not really into the whole
          baring your soul in front of strangers
          thing, but I figure it's now or never.   So
          here goes.

          CUT TO:

          INT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard puts down the hand mic for a second to gain composure.
          His family encourages him on.

          CHUCK
          You're doing great, man.
          Richard pushes the button down on the hand mike.

          RICHARD
          I know you're used to being on your own.
          And that you're comfortable with your life
          the way it is.   And that in a million years
          you wouldn't have thought that we should be
          together.   I know, because I felt the exact
          same way.

          CUT TO:

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Every passenger is enraptured by the words coming out of the
          loudspeaker.   The flight attendants, the Handsome Man, everyone.

          RICHARD (O.S.)
          (over loudspeaker)
          And you know what else I know?   I know that
          I'm tired of being alone.   And I think
          you're tired of being alone too.   So come
          on.   Talk to me.   Please.
          The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (with genuine concern)
          Do you really feel like you're alone?

          

          

          

          

          112.

          MARGARET
          Oh, good lord.

          CUT TO:

          INT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard and his family stare at the radio, waiting to see if
          there is going to be an answer.   Chuck crosses his fingers.

          MARGARET (O.S.)
          (from radio)
          What the hell are you doing?
          Everyone in the tower smiles.   They're making progress.

          RICHARD
          We need to talk.
          (Intercut as necessary.   Margaret stands at the front of the
          plane with the passengers watching.)

          MARGARET
          About what?

          RICHARD
          Have you ever thought there might be a
          reason we've been together for the last
          three years?

          MARGARET
          As boss and assistant.

          RICHARD
          Things change, Margaret.

          MARGARET

          (INCREDULOUS)
          Things change?

          RICHARD
          Yeah, things change.

          MARGARET
          Is that the best you got?
          Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say "see, that's what I said."
          Richard composes himself.

          RICHARD
          Now, tell me the truth.   When you left, were
          you relieved or sad that we didn't have an
          excuse to be together anymore?
          Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up.   That was a good one.

          

          

          

          

          113.

          MARGARET
          What's your point?

          RICHARD
          Because I am sick that you left.   And if you
          feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be
          together?
          Margaret goes to answer, but stops.   Richard is right.   She wants
          to go back.   Even the passengers on the plane can see it.
          Gilbertson panics.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Are you thinking about going back to him?
          Margaret doesn't answer.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          We have a deal!   You can't back out now!
          The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying
          to break up Richard and Margaret.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Sir, you need to sit down.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I will do no such thing.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Sir, I'm ordering you to return to your
          seat.
          Other passengers yell "sit down asshole" at Gilbertson.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Who said that?

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Sir, this is your third and final warning!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Listen sweetheart...
          (he pokes the flight attendant)
          I'm a federal officer, so why don't you get
          me another cocktail and mind your own...
          BUZZ! ZAP!                                                            400,000 Volts of electricity surge through
          Gilbertson.   He twitches violently and crashes to the floor.
          Behind him, The Handsome Man holds a stun gun and a badge.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Well, I'm a federal Air Marshall.   And
          you're under arrest for disobeying a crew
          member, assault, and possible intoxication.

          

          

          

          

          114.
          The Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around
          Gilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom.   He then
          takes the CB from Margaret and speaks to the passengers.
          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)
          Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need
          to get this unruly passenger off the plane
          ASAP.   Sitka's the closest airport, so if
          it's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain
          turn this bird around.
          There are wild cheers from the passengers.   Margaret blushes.
          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)
          (winks at Margaret)
          Told you I was a romantic.

          EXT. SITKA AIRPORT RUNWAY - DAY

          Flight 1601 glides to a safe landing.   Richard and his family
          wait on the tarmac, and the plane taxis to them.   A truck drives
          stairs to the front door of the plane and the door opens.
          Margaret steps out.   Richard walks up the steps.

          MARGARET
          This wasn't supposed to happen.
          Richard looks Margaret in the eye.

          RICHARD
          But it did.
          Margaret looks down.   A little embarrassed.

          MARGARET
          I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved.
          Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and
          plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him.
          The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Uh, sorry, but excuse us.
          The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson
          down the steps.

          MARGARET
          (to Gilbertson)
          Hey!   Do you think getting arrested might
          affect you at work?
          Gilbertson has no retort.

          

          

          

          

          115.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh, and I'm not going to be able to publish
          your book after all.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          So you are getting married this weekend?

          MARGARET

          (SMILING)
          Absolutely not.   But who knows?
          (looking at Richard)
          We might by the time you get out of jail.
          Gilbertson makes a "go to hell" face and shuffles off.
          Margaret turns back to Richard.   All smiles.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I've got some explaining to do.
          Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of
          Richard's family.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Debbie)
          Hi.   I'm Margaret.   I've known your son for
          years, but we've just recently begun to see
          each other romantically.
          (to Geoffrey)
          I want to get to know you all, and spend
          some real time up here in Alaska.
          (to Annie)
          I'm not sure when you are going to see him
          get married, but I promise as long as I'm
          with him, he'll be happy.
          Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          That's all we ever wanted.
          Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug.   Debbie joins
          in.   Then Geoffrey.   Passengers cheer.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. PAXTON ISLAND - DANCEFLOOR - DAY

          The party is in full swing.
          Balzac chases his balls.
          Ramone slides onstage and SINGS with the band.   He has a
          beautiful voice.
          Debbie and Geoffrey cut a rug.   They've done this before.

          

          

          

          

          116.
          Gertrude and Annie chat and laugh at a nearby table.   The
          Handsome Man brings Gertrude a drink.   Grandma Annie winks and
          leaves these two alone.
          Margaret and Richard dance.   All smiles, even though they aren't
          very good.
          And as everyone dances, we track up the tallest tree on the
          island, to an eagle's nest at the very top.   Inside the nest,
          three eaglets chirp along to the music, snuggled up to Margaret's
          phone.

Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                         princess. But she had an enchantment 
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                         only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                         Many brave knights had attempted to 
                         free her from this dreadful prison, 
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                         the tallest tower for her true love 
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                         a load of - (toilet flush)
 
               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
               after the ogre.
 
               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                                     MAN1
                         Think it's in there?

                                     MAN2
                         All right. Let's get it!

                                     MAN1
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
                         thing can do to you?
 
                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
                         bread.
 
               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly 
                         peeled skin.
 
                                     MEN
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
                         quite good on toast.
 
                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)
 
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
               men are in the dark.
 
                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away. 
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks 
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. 
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and 
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)
 
                         
               THE NEXT DAY

               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
               little pigs.
 
                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it 
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
 
                         
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
                         broom in half)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
                         Next!
 
                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.

                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
                         Give me another chance!
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
                         nose grows)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
                         Take it away.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
                         Help me!
 
               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
               to the table.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
                         if you can prove it.
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
 
                         
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
                         you ever saw.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Get her out of my sight.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey! I can fly!

                                     PETER PAN
                         He can fly!

                                     3 LITTLE PIGS
                         He can fly!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         He can talk!

                                     DONKEY
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might 
                         have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
                         but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
                         fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins 
                         to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink 
                         to the ground.)
 
               He hits the ground with a thud.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) 
                         After him!
 
                                     GUARDS
                         He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
                         Turn!
 
               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
               quickly hides behind Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         You there. Ogre!

                                     SHREK
                         Aye?

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
                         to place you both under arrest and transport 
                         you to a designated resettlement facility.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, really? You and what army?

               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
               begins walking back to his cottage.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Can I say something to you? Listen, 
                         you was really, really, really somethin' 
                         back here. Incredible!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Are you talkin' to...(he turns around 
                         and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back 
                         around and Donkey is right in front 
                         of him.) Whoa!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell 
                         you that you that you was great back 
                         here? Those guards! They thought they 
                         was all of that. Then you showed up, 
                         and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
                         like babes in the woods. That really 
                         made me feel good to see that.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's great. Really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, it's good to be free.

                                     SHREK
                         Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
                         freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
                         I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
                         wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
                         stick with you. You're mean, green, 
                         fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
                         the spit out of anybody that crosses 
                         us.
 
               Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
               loudly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
                         don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
                         work, your breath certainly will get 
                         the job done, 'cause you definitely 
                         need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
                         you breath stinks! You almost burned 
                         the hair outta my nose, just like the 
                         time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
                         continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
                         his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten 
                         berries. I had strong gases leaking 
                         out of my butt that day.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Why are you following me?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause 
                         I'm all alone, There's no one here beside 
                         me, My problems have all gone, There's 
                         no one to deride me, But you gotta have 
                         faith...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't 
                         have any friends.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Wow. Only a true friend would be that 
                         cruelly honest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Listen, little donkey. Take a look at 
                         me. What am I?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really 
                         tall?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your 
                         torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that 
                         bother you?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Nope.

                                     SHREK
                         Really?

                                     DONKEY
                         Really, really.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, I like you. What's you name?

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek? Well, you know what I like about 
                         you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me 
                         thing. I like that. I respect that, 
                         Shrek. You all right. (They come over 
                         a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) 
                         Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live 
                         in place like that?
 
                                     SHREK
                         That would be my home.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. 
                         You know you are quite a decorator. 
                         It's amazing what you've done with such 
                         a modest budget. I like that boulder. 
                         That is a nice boulder. I guess you 
                         don't entertain much, do you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         I like my privacy.

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, I do too. That's another thing 
                         we have in common. Like I hate it when 
                         you got somebody in your face. You've 
                         trying to give them a hint, and they 
                         won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
                         (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I stay with you, please?

                                     SHREK
                         (sarcastically) Of course!

                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please! I don't wanna go back there! 
                         You don't know what it's like to be 
                         considered a freak. (pause while he 
                         looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. 
                         But that's why we gotta stick together. 
                         You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Okay! But one night only.

                                     DONKEY
                         Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto 
                         a chair.) No! No!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         This is gonna be fun! We can stay up 
                         late, swappin' manly stories, and in 
                         the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Where do, uh, I sleep?

                                     SHREK
                         (irritated) Outside!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, 
                         I don't know you, and you don't know 
                         me, so I guess outside is best, you 
                         know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek 
                         slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do 
                         like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was 
                         born outside. I'll just be sitting by 
                         myself outside, I guess, you know. By 
                         myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's 
                         no one here beside me...
 
               SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

               Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
               a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
               noise. He stands up with a huff.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (to Donkey) I thought I told you to 
                         stay outside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (from the window) I am outside.

               There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
               made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
               and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
 
                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Well, gents, it's a far cry from the 
                         farm, but what choice do we have?
 
                         
                                     BLIND MOUSE2
                         It's not home, but it'll do just fine.
 
                         
                                     GORDO
                         (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes 
                         and lands on his shoulder.)
 
                                     GORDO
                         I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's 
                         ear)
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ow!

                                     GORDO
                         Blah! Awful stuff.

                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Is that you, Gordo?

                                     GORDO
                         How did you know?

                                     SHREK
                         Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are 
                         you doing in my house? (He gets bumped 
                         from behind and he drops the mice.) 
                         Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves 
                         with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, 
                         no, no. Dead broad off the table.
 
                         
                                     DWARF
                         Where are we supposed to put her? The 
                         bed's taken.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Huh?

               Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
               The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
               him.
 
                                     BIG BAD WOLF
                         What?

               TIME LAPSE

               Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging 
               him to the front door.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm 
                         a terrifying ogre! What do I have to 
                         do get a little privacy? (He opens the 
                         front door to throw the Wolf out and 
                         he sees that all the collected Fairy 
                         Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, 
                         no. No! No!
 
               The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
               pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
               flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         What are you doing in my swamp? (this 
                         echoes and everyone falls silent.)
 
                         
               Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a 
               tent.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right, get out of here. All of you, 
                         move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! 
                         Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more 
                         dwarves run inside the house) No, no! 
                         No, no. Not there. Not there. (they 
                         shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to 
                         look at Donkey)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite 
                         them.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         We were forced to come here.

                                     SHREK
                         (flabbergasted) By who?

                                     LITTLE PIG
                         Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed 
                         and he...signed an eviction notice.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where 
                         this Farquaad guy is?
 
               Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, I do. I know where he is.

                                     SHREK
                         Does anyone else know where to find 
                         him? Anyone at all?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Me! Me!

                                     SHREK
                         Anyone?

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! 
                         Me, me!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy 
                         tale things. Do not get comfortable. 
                         Your welcome is officially worn out. 
                         In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad 
                         right now and get you all off my land 
                         and back where you came from! (Pause. 
                         Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) 
                         You! You're comin' with me.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, that's what I like to hear, 
                         man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart 
                         friends, off on a whirlwind big-city 
                         adventure. I love it!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (singing) On the road again. Sing it 
                         with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get 
                         on the road again.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What did I say about singing?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I whistle?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I hum it?

                                     SHREK
                         All right, hum it.

               Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

               DULOC - KITCHEN

               A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually 
               dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         That's enough. He's ready to talk.
 
                         
               The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
               onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
               table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
               up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs 
                         and plays with them) Run, run, run, 
                         as fast as you can. You can't catch 
                         me. I'm the gingerbread man.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         You are a monster.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'm not the monster here. You are. You 
                         and the rest of that fairy tale trash, 
                         poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell 
                         me! Where are the others?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's 
                         eye.)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
                         Now my patience has reached its end! 
                         Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to 
                         pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop 
                         buttons.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         All right then. Who's hiding them?
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the 
                         muffin man?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives 
                         on Drury Lane?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Well, she's married to the muffin man.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         She's married to the muffin man.

               The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         My lord! We found it.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Then what are you waiting for? Bring 
                         it in.
 
               More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
               They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
               Mirror.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         (in awe) Ohhhh...

                         Magic mirror...

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks 
                         him up and dumps him into a trash can 
                         with a lid.) No!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. 
                         Is this not the most perfect kingdom 
                         of them all?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         Well, technically you're not a king.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a 
                         hand mirror and smashes it with his 
                         fist.) You were saying?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         What I mean is you're not a king yet. 
                         But you can become one. All you have 
                         to do is marry a princess.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Go on.

                         (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back 
                         and relax, my lord, because it's time 
                         for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
                         And here they are! Bachelorette number 
                         one is a mentally abused shut-in from 
                         a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
                         and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
                         include cooking and cleaning for her 
                         two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
                         (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette 
                         number two is a cape-wearing girl from 
                         the land of fancy. Although she lives 
                         with seven other men, she's not easy. 
                         Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
                         find out what a live wire she is. Come 
                         on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows 
                         picture of Snow White) And last, but 
                         certainly not last, bachelorette number 
                         three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded 
                         castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
                         But don't let that cool you off. She's 
                         a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
                         and getting caught in the rain. Yours 
                         for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows 
                         picture of Princess Fiona) So will it 
                         be bachelorette number one, bachelorette 
                         number two or bachelorette number three?

                         Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number 
                         three, my lord!

                         Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess 
                         Fiona.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I 
                         have to do is just find someone who 
                         can go...

                         But I probably should mention the little 
                         thing that happens at night.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll do it.

                         Yes, but after sunset...

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona 
                         my queen, and DuLoc will finally have 
                         the perfect king! Captain, assemble 
                         your finest men. We're going to have 
                         a tournament. (smiles evilly)
 
               DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section

               Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking 
               lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But that's it. That's it right there. 
                         That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.

                         So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY

                                     SHREK
                         Do you think maybe he's compensating 
                         for something? (He laughs, but then 
                         groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. 
                         He continues walking through the parking 
                         lot.)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

                                     MAN
                         Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing 
                         a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, 
                         screams and begins running through the 
                         rows of rope to get to the front gate 
                         to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. 
                         Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just 
                         - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins 
                         walking straight through the rows. The 
                         attendant runs into a wall and falls 
                         down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then 
                         continue on into DuLoc.)
 
               DULOC

               They look around but all is quiet.

                                     SHREK
                         It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, look at this!

               Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box 
               marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors 
               open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin 
               to sing.
 
                                     WOODEN PEOPLE
                         Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town
 
                         
               Here we have some rules

               Let us lay them down

               Don't make waves, stay in line

               And we'll get along fine

               DuLoc is perfect place

               Please keep off of the grass

               Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

               DuLoc is, DuLoc is

               DuLoc is perfect place.

               Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.

                                     DONKEY
                         Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready 
                         to run over and pull the lever again)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) 
                         No. No. No, no, no! No.
 
               They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Brave knights. You are the best and 
                         brightest in all the land. Today one 
                         of you shall prove himself...
 
               As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena 
               Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right. You're going the right way 
                         for a smacked bottom.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Sorry about that.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         That champion shall have the honor - 
                         - no, no - - the privilege to go forth 
                         and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona 
                         from the fiery keep of the dragon. If 
                         for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, 
                         the first runner-up will take his place 
                         and so on and so forth. Some of you 
                         may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing 
                         to make. (cheers) Let the tournament 
                         begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is 
                         that? It's hideous!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (turns to look at Donkey and then back 
                         at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. 
                         It's just a donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who 
                         kills the ogre will be named champion! 
                         Have it him!
 
                                     MEN
                         Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps 
                         into a table where there are mugs of 
                         beer)
 
                                     CROWD
                         Go ahead! Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just 
                         settle this over a pint?
 
                                     CROWD
                         Kill the beast!

                                     SHREK
                         No? All right then. (drinks the beer) 
                         Come on!
 
               He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel 
               of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the 
               other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides 
               past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. 
               As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger 
               beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. 
               Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much 
               fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice 
               to say that Shrek kicks butt.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

               Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek 
               gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah!

               A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time 
               and sees him.
 
                                     WOMAN
                         The chair! Give him the chair!

               Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men 
               are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding 
               sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you 
                         very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try 
                         the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)
 
               The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on 
               Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Shall I give the order, sir?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         No, I have a better idea. People of 
                         DuLoc, I give you our champion!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Congratulations, ogre. You're won the 
                         honor of embarking on a great and noble 
                         quest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest 
                         to get my swamp back.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Your swamp?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those 
                         fairy tale creatures!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you 
                         a deal. Go on this quest for me, and 
                         I'll give you your swamp back.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Exactly the way it was?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         And the squatters?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         As good as gone.

                                     SHREK
                         What kind of quest?

               Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field 
               heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Let me get this straight. You're gonna 
                         go fight a dragon and rescue a princess 
                         just so Farquaad will give you back 
                         a swamp which you only don't have because 
                         he filled it full of freaks in the first 
                         place. Is that about right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, maybe there's a good reason 
                         donkeys shouldn't talk.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't get it. Why don't you just pull 
                         some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle 
                         him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds 
                         his bones to make your bread, the whole 
                         ogre trip.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have 
                         decapitated an entire village and put 
                         their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, 
                         cut open their spleen and drink their 
                         fluids. Does that sound good to you?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, no, not really, no.

                                     SHREK
                         For your information, there's a lot 
                         more to ogres than people think.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Example?

                                     SHREK
                         Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. 
                         (he holds out his onion)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs the onion) They stink?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes - - No!

                                     DONKEY
                         They make you cry?

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     DONKEY
                         You leave them in the sun, they get 
                         all brown, start sproutin' little white 
                         hairs.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres 
                         have layers! Onions have layers. You 
                         get it? We both have layers. (he heaves 
                         a sigh and then walks off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both 
                         have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, 
                         not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody 
                         loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't care... what everyone likes. 
                         Ogres are not like cakes.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what else everybody likes? 
                         Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, 
                         you say, "Let's get some parfait," they 
                         say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"? 
                         Parfaits are delicious.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! You dense, irritating, miniature 
                         beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! 
                         And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Parfaits may be the most delicious thing 
                         on the whole damn planet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, I think I preferred your humming.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Do you have a tissue or something? I'm 
                         making a mess. Just the word parfait 
                         make me start slobbering.
 
               They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through 
               a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying 
               to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, 
               so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.
 
               DRAGON'S KEEP

               Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to 
               house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? 
                         You gotta warn somebody before you just 
                         crack one off. My mouth was open and 
                         everything.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd 
                         be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We 
                         must be getting close.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking 
                         about it's the brimstone. I know what 
                         I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It 
                         didn't come off no stone neither.
 
                         
               They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There 
               is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where 
               the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very 
               foreboding.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Sure, it's big enough, but look at the 
                         location. (laughs...then the laugh turns 
                         into a groan)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said 
                         ogres have layers?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, aye.

                                     DONKEY
                         Well, I have a bit of a confession to 
                         make. Donkeys don't have layers. We 
                         wear our fear right out there on our 
                         sleeves.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what I mean.

                                     SHREK
                         You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         No, I'm just a little uncomfortable 
                         about being on a rickety bridge over 
                         a boiling like of lava!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside 
                         ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll 
                         just tackle this thing together one 
                         little baby step at a time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Just keep moving. And don't look down.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. 
                         Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't 
                         look down. (he steps through a rotting 
                         board and ends up looking straight down 
                         into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! 
                         Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me 
                         off, please!
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you're already halfway.

                                     DONKEY
                         But I know that half is safe!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. 
                         You go back.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, no! Wait!

                                     SHREK
                         Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance 
                         then, shall me? (bounces and sways the 
                         bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't do that!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces 
                         the bridge again)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, that!

                                     SHREK
                         Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to 
                         bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across 
                         the bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

                                     SHREK
                         You said do it! I'm doin' it.

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, 
                         I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) 
                         Oh!
 
                                     SHREK
                         That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks 
                         towards the castle)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. So where is this fire-breathing 
                         pain-in-the-neck anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. 
                         (chuckles)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.
 
                         
               INSIDE THE CASTLE

                                     DONKEY
                         You afraid?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         But...

                                     SHREK
                         Shh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton 
                         and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong 
                         with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 
                         response to an unfamiliar situation. 
                         Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might 
                         add. With a dragon that breathes fire 
                         and eats knights and breathes fire, 
                         it sure doesn't mean you're a coward 
                         if you're a little scared. I sure as 
                         heck ain't no coward. I know that.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. 
                         Now go over there and see if you can 
                         find any stairs.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (putting on a helmet) The princess will 
                         be up the stairs in the highest room 
                         in the tallest tower.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What makes you think she'll be there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I read it in a book once. (walks off)
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle 
                         the stairs. I'll find those stairs. 
                         I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs 
                         won't know which way they're goin'. 
                         (walks off)
 
               EMPTY ROOM

               Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it 
                         to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm 
                         the stair master. I've mastered the 
                         stairs. I wish I had a step right here. 
                         I'd step all over it.
 
               ELSEWHERE

               Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.

                                     SHREK
                         Well, at least we know where the princess 
                         is, but where's the...
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (os) Dragon!

               Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. 
               Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon 
               breathes fire.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, look out! (he manages to get 
                         a hold of the dragons tail and holds 
                         on) Got ya!
 
               The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek 
               goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the 
               tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying 
               on the floor.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Aah! Aah!

               Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small 
               part of the bridge he's on.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh, 
                         what large teeth you have. (the dragon 
                         growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth. 
                         I know you probably hear this all time 
                         from your food, but you must bleach, 
                         'cause that is one dazzling smile you 
                         got there. Do I detect a hint of minty 
                         freshness? And you know what else? You're 
                         - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! 
                         I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. 
                         You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 
                         (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes 
                         at him) What's the matter with you? 
                         You got something in your eye? Ohh. 
                         Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, 
                         but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon 
                         blows a smoke ring in the shape of a 
                         heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm 
                         an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd 
                         work out if you're gonna blow smoke 
                         rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him 
                         up with her teeth and carries him off) 
                         No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
 
               FIONA'S ROOM

               Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona 
               so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She 
               then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off 
               the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. 
               Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for 
               a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders 
               and shakes her away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Oh! Oh!

                                     SHREK
                         Wake up!

                                     FIONA
                         What?

                                     SHREK
                         Are you Princess Fiona?

                                     FIONA
                         I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to 
                         rescue me.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

                                     FIONA
                         But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our 
                         first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, 
                         romantic moment?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should 
                         sweep me off my feet out yonder window 
                         and down a rope onto your valiant steed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         You've had a lot of time to plan this, 
                         haven't you?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) Mm-hmm.

               Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down 
               the hallway.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But we have to savor this moment! You 
                         could recite an epic poem for me. A 
                         ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I don't think so.

                                     FIONA
                         Can I at least know the name of my champion?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     FIONA
                         Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds 
                         out a handkerchief) I pray that you 
                         take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Thanks!

               Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.

                                     FIONA
                         (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         It's on my to-do list. Now come on! 
                         (takes off running and drags Fiona behind 
                         him.)
 
                                     FIONA
                         But this isn't right! You were meant 
                         to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. 
                         That's what all the other knights did.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, right before they burst into flame.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly 
                         stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek 
                         ignores her and heads for a wooden door 
                         off to the side.) Wait. Where are you 
                         going? The exit's over there.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I have to save my ass.

                                     FIONA
                         What kind of knight are you?

                                     SHREK
                         One of a kind. (opens the door into 
                         the throne room)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. 
                         I believe it's healthy to get to know 
                         someone over a long period of time. 
                         Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs 
                         worriedly) (we see him up close and 
                         from a distance as Shrek sneaks into 
                         the room) I don't want to rush into 
                         a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally 
                         ready for a commitment of, uh, this 
                         - - Magnitude really is the word I'm 
                         looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that 
                         is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what 
                         are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just 
                         back up a little and take this one step 
                         at a time. We really should get to know 
                         each other first as friends or pen pals. 
                         I'm on the road a lot, but I just love 
                         receiving cards - - I'd really love 
                         to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's 
                         my tail! That's my personal tail. You're 
                         gonna tear it off. I don't give permission 
                         - - What are you gonna do with that? 
                         Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. 
                         No, no, no. No! Oh!
 
               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings 
               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks 
               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. 
               He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps 
               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. 
               Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and 
               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto 
               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms 
               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey 
               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and 
               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hi, Princess!

                                     FIONA
                         It talks!

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's 
                         the trick.
 
               They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots 
               a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a 
               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His 
               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles 
               off and walks lightly.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

               Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll 
                         take care of the dragon.
 
               Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the 
               castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping 
               chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that 
               is still around the dragons neck.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (echoing) Run!

               They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot 
               pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons 
               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on 
               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They 
               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look 
               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to 
               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the 
               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs 
               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a 
               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You 
                         did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. 
                         (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) 
                         You're - - You're wonderful. You're... 
                         (turns and sees Shrek fall down the 
                         hill and bump into Donkey) a little 
                         unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed 
                         is great, and thy heart is pure. I am 
                         eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears 
                         his throat.) And where would a brave 
                         knight be without his noble steed?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         I hope you heard that. She called me 
                         a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         The battle is won. You may remove your 
                         helmet, good Sir Knight.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, no.

                                     FIONA
                         Why not?

                                     SHREK
                         I have helmet hair.

                                     FIONA
                         Please. I would'st look upon the face 
                         of my rescuer.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

                                     FIONA
                         But how will you kiss me?

                                     SHREK
                         What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the 
                         job description.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Maybe it's a perk.

                                     FIONA
                         No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know 
                         how it goes. A princess locked in a 
                         tower and beset by a dragon is rescued 
                         by a brave knight, and then they share 
                         true love's first kiss.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. 
                         Wait. You think that Shrek is you true 
                         love?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well, yes.

               Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.

                                     DONKEY
                         You think Shrek is your true love!
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         What is so funny?

                                     SHREK
                         Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: 
                         Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. 
                         Now - - Now remove your helmet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Look. I really don't think this is a 
                         good idea.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Just take off the helmet.

                                     SHREK
                         I'm not going to.

                                     FIONA
                         Take it off.

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     FIONA
                         Now!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. 
                         (takes off his helmet)
 
                                     FIONA
                         You- - You're a- - an ogre.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is 
                         all wrong. You're not supposed to be 
                         an ogre.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Princess, I was sent to rescue you by 
                         Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who 
                         wants to marry you.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Then why didn't he come rescue me?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Good question. You should ask him that 
                         when we get there.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But I have to be rescued by my true 
                         love, not by some ogre and his- - his 
                         pet.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Well, so much for noble steed.

                                     SHREK
                         You're not making my job any easier.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. 
                         You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he 
                         wants to rescue me properly, I'll be 
                         waiting for him right here.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all 
                         right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy. 
                         (he swiftly picks her up and swings 
                         her over his shoulder like she was a 
                         sack of potatoes)
 
                                     FIONA
                         You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

                                     SHREK
                         Ya comin', Donkey?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm right behind ya.

                                     FIONA
                         Put me down, or you will suffer the 
                         consequences! This is not dignified! 
                         Put me down!
 
               WOODS

               A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just 
               hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, so here's another question. Say 
                         there's a woman that digs you, right, 
                         but you don't really like her that way. 
                         How do you let her down real easy so 
                         her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't 
                         get burned to a crisp and eaten?
 
                                     FIONA
                         You just tell her she's not your true 
                         love. Everyone knows what happens when 
                         you find your...(Shrek drops her on 
                         the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to 
                         DuLoc the better.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You're gonna love it there, Princess. 
                         It's beautiful!
 
                                     FIONA
                         And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? 
                         What's he like?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Let me put it this way, Princess. Men 
                         of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. 
                         (he and Donkey laugh)
 
               Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off 
               the dust and grime.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't know. There are those who think 
                         little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona: 
                         Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're 
                         just jealous you can never measure up 
                         to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. 
                         But I'll let you do the "measuring" 
                         when you see him tomorrow.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow? 
                         It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop 
                         to make camp?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, that'll take longer. We can keep 
                         going.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But there's robbers in the woods.

                                     DONKEY
                         Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting 
                         to sound good.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything 
                         we're going to see in this forest.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I need to find somewhere to camp now!
 
                         
               Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.
 
               
               MOUNTAIN CLIFF

               Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves 
               a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! Over here.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, we can do better than that. I 
                         don't think this is fit for a princess.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         No, no, it's perfect. It just needs 
                         a few homey touches.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Homey touches? Like what? (he hears 
                         a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona 
                         who has torn the bark off of a tree.)
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee 
                         good night. (goes into the cave and 
                         puts the bark door up behind her)
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You want me to read you a bedtime story? 
                         I will.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (os) I said good night!

               Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the 
               boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona 
               still inside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, What are you doing?

                                     SHREK
                         (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, 
                         come on. I was just kidding.
 
               LATER THAT NIGHT

               Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring 
               up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations 
               to Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, 
                         the only ogre to ever spit over three 
                         wheat fields.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future 
                         from these stars?
 
                                     SHREK
                         The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. 
                         They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, 
                         the Flatulent. You can guess what he's 
                         famous for.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I know you're making this up.

                                     SHREK
                         No, look. There he is, and there's the 
                         group of hunters running away from his 
                         stench.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little 
                         dots.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, Donkey, sometimes things are 
                         more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what 
                         we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Our swamp?

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, when we're through rescuing 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's 
                         no "our". There's just me and my swamp. 
                         The first thing I'm gonna do is build 
                         a ten-foot wall around my land.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real 
                         deep just now. You know what I think? 
                         I think this whole wall thing is just 
                         a way to keep somebody out.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, do ya think?

                                     DONKEY
                         Are you hidin' something?

                                     SHREK
                         Never mind, Donkey.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, this is another one of those onion 
                         things, isn't it?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, this is one of those drop-it and 
                         leave-it alone things.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Why don't you want to talk about it?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Why do you want to talk about it?

                                     DONKEY
                         Why are you blocking?

                                     SHREK
                         I'm not blocking.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, yes, you are.

                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, I'm warning you.

                                     DONKEY
                         Who you trying to keep out?

                                     SHREK
                         Everyone! Okay?

                                     DONKEY
                         (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. 
                         (grins)
 
               At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to 
               the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and 
                         walks over to the edge of the cliff 
                         and sits down)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What's your problem? What you got against 
                         the whole world anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Look, I'm not the one with the problem, 
                         okay? It's the world that seems to have 
                         a problem with me. People take one look 
                         at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, 
                         stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before 
                         they even know me. That's why I'm better 
                         off alone.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what? When we met, I didn't 
                         think you was just a big, stupid, ugly 
                         ogre.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, I know.

                                     DONKEY
                         So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small 
                         and Annoying.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny 
                         one, right there. That one there?
 
                         
               Fiona puts the door back.

                                     SHREK
                         That's the moon.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, okay.

               DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom

               The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays 
               in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic 
               Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, 
                         show her to me. Show me the princess.
 
                         
                                     MIRROR
                         Hmph.

               The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Ah. Perfect.

               Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up 
               to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly 
               at her image in the mirror.
 
               MORNING

               Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey 
               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes 
               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along 
               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles 
               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too 
               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but 
               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona 
               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still 
               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking 
               in his sleep.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like 
                         it like that. Come on, baby. I said 
                         I like it.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)

                                     DONKEY
                         Huh? What?

                                     SHREK
                         Wake up.

                                     DONKEY
                         What? (stretches and yawns)

                                     FIONA
                         Good morning. Hm, how do you like your 
                         eggs?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good morning, Princess!

               Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.

                                     SHREK
                         What's all this about?

                                     FIONA
                         You know, we kind of got off to a bad 
                         start yesterday. I wanted to make it 
                         up to you. I mean, after all, you did 
                         rescue me.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, thanks.

               Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.

                                     FIONA
                         Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead 
                         of us. (walks off)
 
               LATER

               They are once again on their way. They are walking through the 
               forest. Shrek belches.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek!

                                     SHREK
                         What? It's a compliment. Better out 
                         than in, I always say. (laughs)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Well, it's no way to behave in front 
                         of a princess.
 
               Fiona belches

                                     FIONA
                         Thanks.

                                     DONKEY
                         She's as nasty as you are.

                                     SHREK
                         (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly 
                         what I expected.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people 
                         before you get to know them.
 
               She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly 
               from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into 
               a tree.
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         La liberte! Hey!

                                     SHREK
                         Princess!

                                     FIONA
                         (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?
 
                         
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! 
                         And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses 
                         up her arm while Fiona pulls back in 
                         disgust)...beast.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! That's my princess! Go find you 
                         own!
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a 
                         little busy here?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't 
                         know who you think you are!
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please 
                         let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. 
                         (laughs)
 
               Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out 
               from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         I steal from the rich and give to the 
                         needy.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         He takes a wee percentage,

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty 
                         damsels, man, I'm good.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         What a guy, Monsieur Hood.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Break it down. I like an honest fight 
                         and a saucy little maid...
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         What he's basically saying is he likes 
                         to get...
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush 
                         grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.
 
                         
                                     MERRY MEN
                         That's bad.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         When a beauty's with a beast it makes 
                         me awfully mad.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         He's mad, he's really, really mad.
 
                         
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         I'll take my blade and ram it through 
                         your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 
                         'cause I'm about to start...
 
               There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and 
               knocks Robin Hood unconscious.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Man, that was annoying!

               Shrek looks at her in admiration.

                                     MERRY MAN
                         Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at 
                         Fiona but she ducks out of the way)
 
                         
               The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to 
               get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.
 
               
               Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and 
               then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is 
               a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in 
               mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, 
               and Fiona begins walking away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Uh, shall we?

                                     SHREK
                         Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins 
                         walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, 
                         whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come 
                         from?
 
                                     FIONA
                         What?

                                     SHREK
                         That! Back there. That was amazing! 
                         Where did you learn that?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, 
                         uh, one has to learn these things in 
                         case there's a...(gasps and points) 
                         there's an arrow in your butt!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you 
                         look at that? (he goes to pull it out 
                         but flinches because it's tender)
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so 
                         sorry.

                         Shrek's hurt.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, 
                         Shrek's gonna die.

                         Donkey, I'm okay.

                                     DONKEY
                         You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm 
                         too young for you to die. Keep you legs 
                         elevated. Turn your head and cough. 
                         Does anyone know the Heimlich?

                         Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help 
                         Shrek, run into the woods and find me 
                         a blue flower with red thorns.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on 
                         it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die 
                         Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay 
                         away from the light!

                         (like it's obvious) For getting rid 
                         of Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ah.

                         Now you hold still, and I'll yank this 
                         thing out. (gives the arrow a little 
                         pull)

                         yankin'.
 
               As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and 
               Shrek keeps dodging her hands.

                         I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

                         Now, hold on.

                         hand over her face to stop her from 
                         getting at the arrow) Okay. What do 
                         you propose we do?

               Donkey is still looking for the special flower.

                         (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just

                         That's...is that blood?
 
               Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue 
               on their way.
 
               There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc. 
               Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a 
               small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as 
               Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back 
               into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting 
               and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb 
               that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it 
               around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins 
               eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. 
               Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting 
               it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning 
               it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group 
               arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc.

                         Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks 
                         Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, 
                         which I think means he has a really...(Shrek

                         what they always say, and then next 
                         thing you know, you're on your back.

                         I didn't want to say nothin', but I 
                         got this twinge in my neck, and when 
                         I turn my head like this, look, (turns 
                         his neck in a very sharp way until his 
                         head is completely sideways) Ow! See?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I'll get the firewood.

                         feel my toes! (looks down and yelps) 
                         I don't have any toes! I think I need 
                         a hug.
 
               SUNSET

               Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while 
               Fiona eats.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Mmm. This is good. This is really good. 
                         What is this?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.

                         No kidding. Well, this is delicious.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, they're also great in stews. Now, 
                         I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean 
                         weed rat stew. (chuckles)
 
               Fiona looks at DuLoc and sighs.

                                     FIONA
                         I guess I'll be dining a little differently 
                         tomorrow night.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp 
                         sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff 
                         for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare 
                         - - you name it.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) I'd like that.

               They smiles at each other.

                                     SHREK
                         Um, Princess?

                                     FIONA
                         Yes, Shrek?

                         I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) 
                         Are you gonna eat that?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic? 
                         Just look at that sunset.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's 
                         late. I-It's very late.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     DONKEY
                         Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on 
                         here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't 
                         you?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. 
                         You know, I'd better go inside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to 
                         be afraid of the dark, too, until - 
                         - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of 
                         the dark.
 
               Shrek sighs

                         Good night.

                                     SHREK
                         Good night.

               Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks 
               at Shrek with a new eye.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on 
                         here.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, what are you talkin' about?

                                     DONKEY
                         I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm 
                         an animal, and I got instincts. And 
                         I know you two were diggin' on each 
                         other. I could feel it.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You're crazy. I'm just bringing her 
                         back to Farquaad.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell 
                         the pheromones. Just go on in and tell 
                         her how you feel.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, 
                         even if I did tell her that, well, you 
                         know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause 
                         I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm 
                         - -
 
                                     DONKEY
                         An ogre?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah. An ogre.

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, where you goin'?

                                     SHREK
                         To get... move firewood. (sighs)

               Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already 
               is.
 
               TIME LAPSE

               Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is 
               nowhere to be seen.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, 
                         where are you? Princess?
 
               Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing 
                         no games.
 
               Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't 
               look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking 
               out.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Aah!

                         No, it's okay. It's okay.

                                     DONKEY
                         What did you do with the princess?
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey, I'm the princess.

                                     DONKEY
                         Aah!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to 
                         her stomach) Can you hear me?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey!

                                     DONKEY
                         (still aimed at her stomach) Listen, 
                         keep breathing! I'll get you out of 
                         there!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No!

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

                         This is me.

               Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets 
               down.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess? What happened to you? You're, 
                         uh, uh, uh, different.

                         I'm ugly, okay?

                                     DONKEY
                         Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 
                         'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a 
                         bad idea. You are what you eat, I said.

                                     DONKEY
                         What do you mean? Look, I ain't never 
                         seen you like this before.

                         It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little 
                         girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every 
                         night I become this. This horrible,

                         rescue me. That's why I have to marry 
                         Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun 
                         sets and he sees me like this. (begins

                         it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. 
                         Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly.

                         Shrek?

               OUTSIDE

               Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his 
               hand.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (to himself) Princess, I - - Uh, how's 
                         it going, first of all? Good? Um, good 
                         for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower 
                         and thought of you because it's pretty 
                         and - - well, I don't really like it, 
                         but I thought you might like it 'cause 
                         you're pretty. But I like you anyway. 
                         I'd - - uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble. 
                         Okay, here we go.
 
               He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey 
               and Fiona talking.

                         really, who can ever love a beast so 
                         hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" 
                         don't go together. That's why I can't 
                         stay here with Shrek.
 
               Shrek steps back in shock.

               Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks 
               away.

                         Look at my eye twitchin'.
 
               Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks 
               down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back 
               inside the windmill.
 
               MORNING

               Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still 
               awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.

                         runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek! 
                         Shrek, there's something I want...(she 
                         looks and sees the rising sun, and as 
                         the sun crests the sky she turns back 
                         into a human.)
 
               Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards

                                     SHREK
                         Every word.

                                     FIONA
                         I thought you'd understand.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who 
                         could love a hideous, ugly beast?"
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         But I thought that wouldn't matter to 
                         you.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at 
                         him in shock. He looks past her and 
                         spots a group approaching.) Ah, right 
                         on time. Princess, I've brought you 
                         a little something.
 
               Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal 
               sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only 
               like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers 
               march by.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots 
                         the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that? 
                         Couldn't have been the donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona.

                                     SHREK
                         As promised. Now hand it over.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece 
                         of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared 
                         out, as agreed. Take it and go before 
                         I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper) 
                         Forgive me, Princess, for startling 
                         you, but you startled me, for I have 
                         never seen such a radiant beauty before. 
                         I'm Lord Farquaad.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad 
                         snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, 
                         for I was just saying a short... (Watches 
                         as Farquaad is lifted off his horse 
                         and set down in front of her. He comes 
                         to her waist.) farewell.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have 
                         to waste good manners on the ogre. It's 
                         not like it has feelings.
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, you're right. It doesn't.

               Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless 
                         Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. 
                         Will you be the perfect bride for the 
                         perfect groom?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would 
                         make - -
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (interrupting) Excellent! I'll start 
                         the plans, for tomorrow we wed!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get 
                         married today before the sun sets.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. 
                         The sooner, the better. There's so much 
                         to do! There's the caterer, the cake, 
                         the band, the guest list. Captain, round 
                         up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona 
                         on the back of his horse)
 
                                     FIONA
                         Fare-thee-well, ogre.

               Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches 
               them go.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting 
                         her get away.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah? So what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, there's something about her you 
                         don't know. Look, I talked to her last 
                         night, She's - -
 
                                     SHREK
                         I know you talked to her last night. 
                         You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if 
                         you two are such good friends, why don't 
                         you follow her home?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

                                     SHREK
                         I told you, didn't I? You're not coming 
                         home with me. I live alone! My swamp! 
                         Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! 
                         Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, 
                         talking donkeys!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But I thought - -

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! 
                         (stomps off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek.

               Montage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona 
               being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running 
               into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner 
               alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.
 
               SHREK'S HOME

               Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes 
               outside to investigate.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues 
                         with what he's doing.) What are you 
                         doing?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I would think, of all people, you would 
                         recognize a wall when you see one.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed 
                         to go around my swamp, not through it.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         It is around your half. See that's your 
                         half, and this is my half.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh! Your half. Hmm.

                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. 
                         I did half the work. I get half the 
                         booty. Now hand me that big old rock, 
                         the one that looks like your head.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Back off!

                                     DONKEY
                         No, you back off.

                                     SHREK
                         This is my swamp!

                                     DONKEY
                         Our swamp.

                                     SHREK
                         (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working 
                         with) Let go, Donkey!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You let go.

                                     SHREK
                         Stubborn jackass!

                                     DONKEY
                         Smelly ogre.

                                     SHREK
                         Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks 
                         away)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through 
                         with you yet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I'm through with you.

                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, 
                         "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now 
                         it's my turn! So you just shut up and 
                         pay attention! You are mean to me. You 
                         insult me and you don't appreciate anything 
                         that I do! You're always pushing me 
                         around or pushing me away.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so 
                         bad, how come you came back?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Because that's what friends do! They 
                         forgive each other!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive 
                         you... for stabbin' me in the back! 
                         (goes into the outhouse and slams the 
                         door)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, 
                         onion boy, you're afraid of your own 
                         feelings.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (os) Go away!

                                     DONKEY
                         There you are , doing it again just 
                         like you did to Fiona. All she ever 
                         do was like you, maybe even love you.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a 
                         hideous creature. I heard the two of 
                         you talking.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         She wasn't talkin' about you. She was 
                         talkin' about, uh, somebody else.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (opens the door and comes out) She wasn't 
                         talking about me? Well, then who was 
                         she talking about?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. 
                         You don't wanna listen to me. Right? 
                         Right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey!

                                     DONKEY
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh) 
                         I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, 
                         stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, that's what friends are for, right?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Right. Friends?

                                     DONKEY
                         Friends.

                                     SHREK
                         So, um, what did Fiona say about me?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         What are you asking me for? Why don't 
                         you just go ask her?
 
                                     SHREK
                         The wedding! We'll never make it in 
                         time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's 
                         a will, there's a way and I have a way. 
                         (whistles)
 
               Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so 
               they can climb on.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey?

                                     DONKEY
                         I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
 
                         
               They both laugh.

                                     SHREK
                         Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a 
                         noogie)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, all right. Don't get all 
                         slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All 
                         right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't 
                         had a chance to install the seat belts 
                         yet.
 
               They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc.

               DULOC - CHURCH

               Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there. 
               The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.
 
               
                                     PRIEST
                         People of DuLoc, we gather here today 
                         to bear witness to the union....
 
                                     FIONA
                         (eyeing the setting sun) Um-

                                     PRIEST
                         ...of our new king...

                                     FIONA
                         Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead 
                         to the "I do's"?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (chuckles and then motions to the priest 
                         to indulge Fiona) Go on.
 
               COURTYARD

               Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with 
               a boom. The guards all take off running.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. 
                         If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 
                         that? (she nods and goes after the guards) 
                         Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You 
                         wanna do this right, don't you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         (at the Church door) What are you talking 
                         about?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         There's a line you gotta wait for. The 
                         preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or 
                         forever hold your peace." That's when 
                         you say, "I object!"
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't have time for this!

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen 
                         to me! Look, you love this woman, don't 
                         you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yes.

                                     DONKEY
                         You wanna hold her?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please her?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes!

                                     DONKEY
                         (singing James Brown style) Then you 
                         got to, got to try a little tenderness. 
                         (normal) The chicks love that romantic 
                         crap!
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right! Cut it out. When does this 
                         guy say the line?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         We gotta check it out.

               INSIDE CHURCH

               As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the 
               windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see.
 
                                     PRIEST
                         And so, by the power vested in me...
 
                         
               Outside

                                     SHREK
                         What do you see?

                                     DONKEY
                         The whole town's in there.

               Inside

                                     PRIEST
                         I now pronounce you husband and wife...
 
                         
               Outside

                                     DONKEY
                         They're at the altar.

               Inside

                                     PRIEST
                         ...king and queen.

               Outside

                                     DONKEY
                         Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, for the love of Pete!

               He runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard.
 
               
               INSIDE CHURCH

                                     SHREK
                         (running toward the alter) I object!
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Shrek?

               The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, now what does he want?

                                     SHREK
                         (to congregation as he reaches the front 
                         of the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin' 
                         a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first 
                         of all. Very clean.
 
                                     FIONA
                         What are you doing here?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, it's rude enough being alive 
                         when no one wants you, but showing up 
                         uninvited to a wedding...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Fiona! I need to talk to you.

                                     FIONA
                         Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little 
                         late for that, so if you'll excuse me 
                         - -
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you can't marry him.

                                     FIONA
                         And why not?

                                     SHREK
                         Because- - Because he's just marring 
                         you so he can be king.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         He's not your true love.

                                     FIONA
                         And what do you know about true love?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen 
                         in love with the princess! Oh, good 
                         Lord. (laughs)
 
               The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The 
               whole congregation laughs.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         An ogre and a princess!

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek, is this true?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, 
                         my love, we're but a kiss away from 
                         our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! 
                         (puckers his lips and leans toward her, 
                         but she pulls back.)
 
                                     FIONA
                         (looking at the setting sun) "By night 
                         one way, by day another." (to Shrek) 
                         I wanted to show you before.
 
               She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self. 
               She gives Shrek a sheepish smile.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona 
                         smiles)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! 
                         I order you to get that out of my sight 
                         now! Get them! Get them both!
 
               The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights 
               them.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, no!

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This 
                         marriage is binding, and that makes 
                         me king! See? See?
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, let go of me! Shrek!

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Don't just stand there, you morons.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll make you regret the day we met. 
                         I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll 
                         beg for death to save you!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, Shrek!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And 
                         as for you, my wife...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Fiona!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll have you locked back in that tower 
                         for the rest of your days! I'm king!
 
                         
               Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I will have order! I will have perfection! 
                         I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon 
                         show up and the dragon leans down and 
                         eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon 
                         here, and I'm not afraid to use it. 
                         (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on 
                         the edge!
 
               The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth 
               and falls to the ground.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Celebrity marriages. They never last, 
                         do they?
 
               The congregation cheers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Go ahead, Shrek.

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Fiona?

                         (smiles) I love you too.

               Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 
               'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.

                         Aawww!

               Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted 
               up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around 
               her.
 
                                     WHISPERS
                         "Until you find true love's first kiss 
                         and then take love's true form. Take 
                         love's true form. Take love's true form."
 
                         
               Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell 
               and then is slowly lowered to the ground.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are 
                         you all right?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well, 
                         yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed 
                         to be beautiful.
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you ARE beautiful.

               They smile at each other.

                                     DONKEY
                         (chuckles) I was hoping this would be 
                         a happy ending.
 
               Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...

               THE SWAMP

               ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm 
               a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek 
               and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting 
               carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet 
               which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end 
               up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet 
               instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now 
               has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona 
               walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over 
               singing the song.

                         (as he's done singing and we fade to 
                         black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't 
                         breathe. I can't breathe.

 As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to
          slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States.
          The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through
          the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see
          large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's
          winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one
          small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear
          the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           It has been said that magic vanished from
           our world a long time ago. And that
           humanity can no longer fulfill its
           desires through the power of wishes.
           To those who have lost the wondrous
           vision of childhood eyes, submitted here
           is the story of a little boy, and a
           magical Christmas wish that changed his
           life forever.

           It began in 1985, in a town just outside
           Boston.
                         
          We see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at
          each other in the street.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           It was Christmas Eve, and all the
           children were in high spirits. That
           special time of year when Boston children
           gather together and beat up the Jewish
           kids.
                         
          Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled,
          and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball-
          throwing kids points at the sled kid.
                         
                          KID #1
           Hey, Greenbaum!

           Get him!
                         
          The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle
          him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy
          and innocent-looking) approaches the melee.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           But there was one child who wasn't in
           such good spirits. Little John Bennett.
           That one boy in every neighborhood who
           just has a tough time making friends.
                         
                          JOHN
           Hey guys, can I play?
                         
          The kids all look at him.
                         
                          KID #1/#2/#3
           Get outta here! / Get outta here,
           Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett!
                         
          The Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John.
                         
                          GREENBAUM
           Yeah, Bennett, get outta here!
                         
          The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly
          walks back toward his house.

           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           John longed with all his heart for that
           one true friend that he could call his
           own. And he knew that if he ever found
           that friend, he would never let him go.
                         
          John sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands,
          looking outside. John'S POV - We see the other kids all
          playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing
          snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A
          WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with
          open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun.

          John sits amidst unwrapped gifts. We see him opening a
          present. Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear.

           duck pond there, and... when nobody was

           John picked the perfect night to make a
           wish.
                         
          EXT. JOHN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The camera pivots around to face the sky. We see the
          snow falling from moonlit clouds. At the center of the
          clouds, there is a small patch of open air through which
          we can see stars. Suddenly, a shooting star whizzes by
          through the opening.

          sleeping next to it.

          The house and yard are covered with snow.
                         
                         
          INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SAME
                         
          John slowly opens his eyes. He turns over to face Teddy,
          but we see that Teddy is no longer next to him. John
          bolts upright and looks around, frantically.
                         
                          JOHN
           Teddy?

          John looks under the covers, but the bear is not there.
          He jumps out of bed and looks around the bed's perimeter,
          assuming that Teddy must have fallen off during the
          night. Finally, he checks underneath the bed. ANGLE
          FROM UNDERNEATH THE BED we see John looking around.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)

          John sits up again and freezes, looking right into the
          camera, wide eyed. ANGLE ON JOHN'S P.O.V.: We see the
          face of Teddy staring right at him. Teddy blinks once.
                         
                          TEDDY
           Hug me.
                         
          John yelps and stumbles back, falling over. He stares at
          Teddy, breathing heavily.
                         
                          JOHN

          A huge grin spreads across John's face. He gets up, runs
          to Teddy and hugs him.

          John's Dad sits at the breakfast table, reading the paper
          as John's Mom prepares eggs and bacon, putting it on
          their plates.
                          JOHN'S MOM
           Well, I think we had a wonderful
           Christmas this year.

          the ball into the cup "accidentally". Lori smiles. John

          John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up
          behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and
          grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss. We
          ANGLE ON Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering
          a "Home Sweet Home" picture into the wall. He steps
          back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall.
          He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there
          like an idiot.

          CLOSE ON a bong. PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales,
          his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for
          the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is
          ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple
          stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's
          evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's
          been around for three decades. He and John, who sits
          next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them.
          John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-
          worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a
          box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,
          he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the
          remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity
          Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,
          though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that
          this is a guy who has never really given up his
          childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted
          passes the bong to John.

          drives (his paws grip the wheel). We then cut to an

          reveal it crossing Boston's huge suspension bridge.

          John's car pulls up the street and into the parking lot,
          scraping its side against the corner headlight of one of
          the rental cars.

          looks at the damage.

          ANGLE ON THE RENT-A-CAR OFFICE - THOMAS, the branch
          manager, an intense, middle-aged man, is standing in the

           John! May I speak with you, please?

           Hi, Thomas! How are ya?
                         
          Thomas dryly waves back. Ted pulls forward, scraping the
          car again. He abruptly pulls out into traffic, and
          another car swerves a bit to get around him, honking.

           John, it's almost ten o'clock.
                         
                          JOHN
           I know, I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault.

                          THOMAS
           John, all you have to do is not fuck up,
           and you get my job when I go to corporate
           next month. You will be the new branch
           manager. All you have to do is not fuck
           up, and all you're doing is fucking up.
           Not that I don't think you're too fucked
           up to handle not fucking up my job, but
           you happen to be the least fucked-up
           person in the whole office. The next
           least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been
           here three fucking years longer than him.
           But I'm telling you, I will promote the
           fuck out of him if you fuck up one more
           time. That is all. Fuck.
                         
                          JOHN
           Sir, I promise, you're not gonna regret
           promoting the fuck out of me.
                         
                          THOMAS
           Good. I like hearing that. Because in a
           month my life now could be your life: a
           cushy $38,000-a-year branch manager who's
           personal friends with Tom Skerritt. It's
           not a bad life, is it?

          saw them earlier, bookending the day. John drinks a beer
          as they watch TV. Ted lights up a bong and inhales. The
          TV blares the opening titles of the 1980 film "Flash
          Gordon." As "Flash's Theme" plays:

          We hear another thunderclap. Ted runs into the room with

          that read "PLYMOUTH PUBLIC RELATIONS." Lori goes to her
          desk, looking exhausted. Lori's office friends, GINA,

           Oh, I'm okay... except I didn't have time
           for breakfast, the garage was full, I
           spilled coffee on my leg, and I have a
           boyfriend who can't sleep through a storm
           without his teddy bear.

           No, it's not that, I don't care about
           that. I'd love him even if he was a
           janitor. I mean, he's got a huge heart,
           we laugh together all the time, and it's
           just a bonus that he's like the hottest
           guy in Boston.

          gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the
          moves. John thrusts his butt back in one move,
          accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force
          to send her sprawling on the floor. As the crowd reacts
          to this, we see that it is Lori. She starts to get up,
          when John turns and rushes to help her to her feet.
                         
                          JOHN
           Oh my god, are you okay? Oh god, I'm so
           sorry!

           Um, yes. My head hurts a lot.

           Oh, man. Here, let me get you some ice.
                         
          She sits down. He reaches into a nearby glass, pulls out
          a handful of ice, and wraps it in a napkin. He puts it
          against her head. She inhales sharply for a moment.

           much you actually care about me. You

           night eggs and waffles, and we stayed
           there til 5 a.m. watching a movie on the

          We see John leaning against the bar, wearing a white Navy
          officer's uniform, a la Ted Stryker in "Airplane!" as
          "Stayin' Alive" blasts from the jukebox. ANGLE ON LORI,
          who is up on the dance floor, done up like Julie Hagerty.
          John takes his hat off, and tosses it O.S. coolly. He
          struts up to the dance floor, locks eyes with Lori. They
          circle one another for a beat. John suavely takes off
          his jacket, twirls it in the air a few times, and tosses
          it O.S. He then strikes a "finger up" disco pose, with a
          bullet SFX. He and Lori begin disco dancing
          simultaneously. He jumps up, locking his legs around
          Lori, who spins him around in circles, as we cut back to:

           There was no such rule.
          John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small
          box. Lori looks excited.
                         
                          JOHN
           Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for

          John slides the box over to Lori. She picks it up.

           Oh, John.
                         
          Lori unwraps the box and opens it. Inside is a pair of
          nice, but not-super-expensive-looking earrings.
                         
                          JOHN
           Those are the ones you liked, right?

          She opens up the card, which we see as John describes it.
          It says, "Happy 4 year anniversary! Love you."

                          JOHN
                          (NOTICING)
           Ah shit, hang on, my phone fell under the
           seat somewhere. Can you call it?
                         
          Lori punches his number on her cellphone. After a beat,
          we hear The Imperial March from "The Empire Strikes
          Back."
                         
                          LORI
           That's my ringtone?
                         
                          JOHN
           (laughs, embarrassed)
           Oh, yeah...
                         
                          LORI
           What is it? It sounds negative.

           No, it's from The Notebook.
                         
          He reaches under the seat, fishing for the phone, as she
          goes inside.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
                          (STRAINING)
           This is gonna take some doin'.
                         
                          LORI
           All right, well I'll see you upstairs.
                         
          He continues digging for the phone, as she walks inside.
                         
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
          Lori walks toward the apartment, but stops as she hears
          loud music coming from inside. She approaches the door
          cautiously and opens it, revealing...
                         
                         
          INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Lori enters a haze of pot smoke, and a very much trashed
          apartment (empty bottles, wrappers, etc.). Ted sits on
          the sofa with a small group of trashy-looking women.
          They're watching "Romancing the Stone," which plays very
          loudly on the TV.
                         
                          LORI
           What the hell is all this?!
                         
                          TED
           Lori! Hey, you're home early! The
           ladies and I were just watching
           "Romancing the Stone." Got it on Blu-
           Ray. Came in a two-pack with "Jewel of
           the Nile," but I don't know that we'll
           end up watchin' that one.
                         
                          LORI
           This place is a wreck! Who are these
           girls?
                         
                          TED
           Oh, where are my manners? Lori, this is
           Angelique, Heavenly, Cherene, and
           Sauvignon Blanc. I love you girls.
           Y'know, somewhere out there are four
           terrible fathers I wish I could thank for
           this great night.
                         
          The girls ad-lib "Hello," "Nice to meet you," etc.

          Lori glances around the room, then SCREAMS as she sees
          something in the corner.
                         
                          LORI

           Oh man, that's what Dierdre was doin'
           over there in the corner for so long.
           Remember, she was crouched over there and
           I thought she was just makin' a call or
                          SOMETHIN'--

                          TED
           Yeah, she's passed out in the bathroom
           now, she seemed like she was hopped up on
           somethin'. I mean, mystery solved, I
                          GUESS--
                         
                          LORI
           What the fuck!!!!
                         
                          TED
           Lori, if I can-- now this is just
           speculation, but... is it possible that
           this is not so much about the stool in
           the corner, and more about maybe
           tonight's dinner not measuring up to your
           expectations?
                         
                          LORI
           What!!! The fuck!!!
                         
          Lori is speechless with rage. At that moment, we see the
          lobster head poke in aggressively from behind the door.

          At that moment, John enters, holding his cell phone.
                         
                          JOHN
           Found my phone.
                         
          He stops, seeing everyone there.

          Ted and John walk slowly down the ramp circling the
          massive see-through tank, occasionally stopping to
          observe some of the more bizarre varieties of fish. John
          is oddly restrained. Something is on his mind. As they
          stroll, we see a nearby man keeping an eye on them. He
          seems much more interested in them than in the fish.
          This, we will find out later, is DONNY...

           No, you don't. You look dapper.

                          JOHN
           Look, I know it sucks, but you gotta make
           some money so you can pay for an
           apartment.

           I'm a special case. I'm a fucking
           talking bear. They might make an
           exception `cause they're all like, "Aaa!
           This bear can talk and do stuff! Let's
           give him a job and maybe he'll give us a
           few laughs," but then they're surprised
           at what a stellar performance I'm turnin'
           in. And then they practically have to
           give me the Anderson case.

          John discreetly pulls out a baggie of weed.

          the desk, staring at Ted.

          (Over music:) John and Ted walk across the Common,
          passing various park-goers. The occasional person
          notices and points with a "Hey, isn't that..." sort of
          look. They passes three cute girls who flag Ted down.
          Two pose with him as the third takes their picture with
          her cellphone. Ted poses for the photo with one hand on
          the girl's breast. She laughs hard. Ted waves goodbye,
          and he and John make their way over to a park bench.
          They sit. John takes out the weed, looks around for a
          beat, then starts to discreetly roll a joint.
                          TED
           Well, I'm a former celebrity with a
           minimum wage job. This must be what the
           cast of Different Strokes feels like.

           Excuse me.
                         
          John and Ted react, startled. John stuffs the weed in
          his pocket, accidentally dropping the buds in the rolling
          papers on the ground.
                         
          ANGLE ON a creepy-looking man glancing at them
          repeatedly. This is Donny, the fat kid we saw in the
          prologue. He has grown up into a thinner but no less
          creepy man.
                         
                          DONNY
           I'm sorry to bother you, but my son and I
           couldn't help but admire your teddy bear.
                         
          ADJUST TO REVEAL his son, who looks exactly like fat
          young Donny from earlier.
                         
                          JOHN
           (a little uncomfortable)
           Oh. Um, thank you.
                         
                          DONNY
           I'm Donny. And this is my boy, Robert.
           I have to tell you, I've been fascinated
           by your story ever since I was a boy. I
           remember seeing you on the Carson show.
           You were just wonderful.

           arrangement, here's my address and phone
           number.
                         
          He writes on a slip of paper and hands it to John. John
          smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet.

          glance back at Ted as they move off.

          He then breaks into a creepy falsetto.

          They exit. After a beat, the pigeon flies into frame,
          slamming right into a fucking tree.

           I know it wasn't easy, but I just want

           No, what I mean is, there's just no

           don't end up together. You're

           to do to her? Somethin' I call a Dirty
           Fozzie.
          Ted waves to the girl. She waves back. He makes a kissy
          face at her. She giggles and blows him a kiss back. He
          pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex. Her eyes
          widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. He grabs
          an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. The girl
          laughs hysterically. CLOSE ANGLE on Ted, as white liquid
          sprays all over his face from one side, then from the
          other. WIDEN to reveal he's squirting two bottles of
          pump hand soap on either side of him. The girl laughs
          and shakes her head "no."

           skydiving last year, but then she got
           pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we

           she had a miscarriage, and so we ended up
           getting to go skydiving, and it was so

           high heels, but Lori has a sort of...
           regal... trot.

           could take off work and go to Ted's. Am
           I right?

           John, Ted moved out so we could give
           ourselves a chance without him. You're
           not really giving anything a chance if
           you're blowing off work to get high with
           your teddy bear.

          INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
          Ted's boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a
          clipboard. He looks up, and his expression turns to
          confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at
          Ellen's register.
                         
                          FRANK
           What the hell?
                         
          He walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and
          notices him.
                         
           GUY IN LINE
           Hey, dude, you think you could open more
           than one register? There's like a
           thousand people here!
                         
                          FRANK
           There's supposed to be three registers
           open, for god's sake!
                         
          He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms
          off toward the back. He looks around the butcher's
          counter and produce area, then walk into the back
          storeroom.

          Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE
          ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost
          naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging
          her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away,
          with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock
          and horror.

           You had sexual intercourse with a

           produce that we sell to the public.

          We see the "CLOSED" sign on the door. Ted exits,
          finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the
          dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook
          shot into a trash can. He takes the shot:
                         
                          TED
           Kareem!
                         
          The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters.
                         
                          TED (CONT'D)
           You suck, Kareem.
          We hear a soft footstep somewhere O.S. Ted turns and
          looks around. There appears to be no one in the
          darkness.

          floor of his house. Rex points out various items bought
          at auction. John is visibly unenthused. He does not
          like this guy, and definitely does not trust him.
                         
                          REX
           ...and that's a Wade Boggs autographed
           bat. Just barely outbid Phil Donahue for
           that at auction.
                         
                          JOHN
           Wow, cool.
                         
                          REX
           Yeah, cool. And those boxing gloves were
           worn by Joe Louis in his first fight.
           (passing an abstract
                          PAINTING)
           This is art. Do you get it?
           (passing wall mounted pair of
                          GLASSES) )
           These were John Lennon's glasses. Worth
           about two million dollars.
           (passing photo on wall) )
           That's me and Tom Skerritt. Oh, and
           check this out.
                         
          Rex indicates a small, bronze-colored item on a stand.
                         
                          REX (CONT'D)
           See that? Know what that is?
                         
                          JOHN
                          (TOUCHING IT)
           No.
                         
                          REX
           That's Lance Armstrong's nut.
                         
          John quickly pulls his hand away.
                         
                          REX (CONT'D)
           Something, isn't it? Had it freeze-dried
           and bronzed.

           Every now and then, when I feel like my
           life's gettin' me down and things are
           tough, I just come in here and look at
           it, and it reminds me that things aren't
           so bad. That some people have it worse
           than me. I mean, he's only got one ball,
           and I have three. One of them, of
           course, being his.
                         
                          JOHN
           That's inspiring. You've led a rich
           life.
                         
                          REX
           I've fucked the shit outta life.
                          (THEN)
           So talk to me, Goose. How are things
           with you and Lori?
                         
                          JOHN
           Things are great, actually.
                         
                          REX
           That's good, that's good.
                         
                          JOHN
           You know... Lori would hate me for saying
           this, but... she's told me how you are at
           the office, and... as one gentleman to
           another, I just wanna say I really hope
           you fucking get Lou Gehrig's disease.
                         
                          REX
           Whoa, whoa, okay, look, I think I oughtta
           just clear the air here a little. I...
           just want you to know that... I mean,
           yeah, I'm kind of a "fun-time boss" and
           whatnot, but... look man, I do that with
           everybody at the office! I'm just a
           kook! I have no designs on your
           girlfriend. We work together, and that's
           it. I think you're a great guy and she's
           very lucky.
                         
          John is a bit surprised, not unpleasantly so, to hear
          this.
                         
                          JOHN
           Well... that's good to hear.
                         
                          REX
           Well, that's how it is, so...there we go.

          They stand there for a beat, looking at Lance Armstrong's
          nut. John's phone rings the "Knight Rider" theme. John
          answers it.

           Nathan Hale, "I regret that I have but
           one life to give for my country." Alan
           Hale, "Yes, I accept the role of the

                          JOHN

           Rex. I gotta go. I'll be back in thirty
           minutes tops, but Lori cannot find out.
           She absolutely cannot know I was gone.
           If you can cover for me... we're cool on

          He leaps over a hedge toward the parking area. He slides

          ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.

          John and Ted look at each other, squealing with delight.
          Everyone then does their shots.

          John and Ted don't answer for a beat. They look at each
          other nervously. It's clear neither one has any
          experience with this sort of thing.

          Merciless.
                         
                          ASIAN MAN

           DEATH TO MING!!!
                         
          Sam charges the Asian man, tackling him. They both
          tumble over the back of the couch, nearly knocking it
          over. The duck flies out of his arms, landing on the
          floor. It immediately goes after Ted, who screams.
          ANGLE ON SAM, who chokes the Asian man on the floor.
          John struggles to pull him off.
                          JOHN
           Sam, no! Get off him!
                         
          ANGLE ON TED - who circles confrontationally with the
          duck, as in an Irish bar fight. ANGLE BACK ON THE GUYS
          FIGHTING - The Asian man jabs Sam in the eye with the
          other end of the spoon, and Sam goes staggering backward,
          falling into John. They land on the table, smashing it
          in half. They fall to the floor on top of each other.
                         
                          ASIAN MAN
           You crazy! You crazy man!
                         
          The duck charges at Ted and slaps him across the face a
          few times with its wings.
                         
                          TED
           AAA! AAAA! OW!!
          The Asian man calls to the duck from the door.
                         
                          ASIAN MAN
           Come on, James Franco!
                         
          The duck takes one last whack at Ted and waddles over to
          the Asian man, fluttering up into his arms.

           Yeah. Turns out I'm gay or whatever.
           Had no idea. C'mon Jared, let's get a
           drink.
                         
          He and Jared walk off.
          ANGLE ON JOHN, who sits on the couch, looking zoned out
          and drained. Sam Jones approaches.

          partway down the stairwell, and stops short as he sees
          Lori at the bottom, coming partway up the stairs. They
          stare at each other for a beat. She looks as hurt,
          angry, and betrayed as a woman can be.

          Lori storms out into the street. After a beat, John runs
          out after her.

          She hastily pays the cabbie who waits outside. John
          catches up to her and grabs her arm, but she shakes him
          off. She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears.
                          JOHN (CONT'D)

           Jesus, Lori was right. I should have
           stopped hanging out with you a long time
           ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you
           around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going
           nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch
           movies with a teddy fucking bear. And
           because of that, I just lost the love of
           my life.

          8-year-old John and Ted are at the top of a hill with the
          soapbox racer. Ted is in the racer, wearing a helmet.
          John gives the racer a push, and Ted speeds off down the
          hill. At the bottom, he smashes into a tree, shattering
          the racer, and sending him flying out of it onto the
          ground. A dog runs into frame, snatches Ted up, and runs
          off with him. John sprints after the dog.

          on, check this out" gesture. He runs O.S. ANGLE ON the
          stage, where the animal band play their instruments. Ted
          is there among them, stiffly playing the banjo and

          side of the room, where he leans against the wall. He
          shakes his head in a "whatever" fashion, and walks toward

          of paint going down his back.

          headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about
          with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again,
          and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the
          chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted
          to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles
          backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing
          lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall,
          and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out
          of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord
          catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from
          John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and
          cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down,
          whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the
          bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach,
          clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He
          jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the
          clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor,
          yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his
          bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks
          blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face,
          and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.

          The TV wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a
          crash, right on his groin. John lies there, with the TV
          on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily.
          Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over
          to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing
          deteriorates into sobs.

           My dick is in the TV.
                         
          John continues to sob. Ted climbs down off the table and
          up onto the bed. He pushes the TV off John, then lies
          down next to him. Ted starts to sob himself.
                          TED
           I'm so sorry, Johnny. I'm so sorry.

           No, John, we can get her back. Look,
           remember when you were ten, and you hit
           that squirrel with your BB gun, and then
           when we saw it fall from the tree we both
           starting crying? Remember? And then we
           ran up to it and tried to give it CPR?
           And it came back to life? John, we could
           do that again.

           Thanks so much! We're gonna take a short
           break, but we'll be back in a few!

           Uh, hi. Um... This is for Lori Collins.

          Lori gets out of the shower, and begins towelling off,
          still reeling with disgust from her encounter with Rex.
          After a few moments, there's a knock at the door. Lori
          sighs with annoyance, and walks to the door, still in her
          towel. She looks through the peephole, but there's no
          one there. She opens the door cautiously, and looks out
          into the hall. There's no one there.

          She looks down with a start, and sees Ted standing there.
          He's blocking his view with one hand.

           Look, John loves you very much. More
           than anything in the world. And he's
           fallin' to fuckin' pieces without you.
           He knows he screwed up big time, but you
           gotta believe me that is wasn't all his
           fault. If you'll just give him one more
           chance to be with you--
                         
          She rolls her eyes.

           Ted... that's a very nice offer, but I
           don't want you to do that. This is about
           John and me and our problems. And I
           don't think it can be fixed.
                         
                          TED
           Because of me! Look, you want him to be
           a man. And I'm the one who's keepin'
           that from happening. As long as he's got
           his teddy bear, he's still a boy. And I
           care about him as much as you do. But
           I'm willing to give up the boy so you can
           have the man.

          shitty on the inside as on the outside. On the walls,
          there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings,
          photo spreads, etc. Most are from press from Ted's media
          heyday, but some are photographs of Ted and John out in

           When I was a little boy, I saw you on
           television. And I thought you were the
           most amazing, most wonderful thing I'd
           ever seen. Ever. And I asked my father
           if I could have a magical teddy bear,
           too. And he said no. And I was
           heartbroken. I decided that if I ever
           had a son, I would never say no to him.

           Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every once
           in awhile wouldn't hurt.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Me and Ted are gonna be best friends,
           daddy.
                         
                          DONNY
           Yes. You are. Happy play time.
          Donny shuts the door. Robert stares at Ted.
                         
                          TED

           Yeah well, fuck your dad.
                         
          Ted scrambles for the window and tries to open it. It
          doesn't budge. He takes a running leap at it, but just
          bounces off like a plush toy, and lands on the floor.

                          ROBERT

           punished me for it.

          Robert grabs Ted with one hand, and gets a grip on one of
          Ted's ears with the other hand. Robert pulls on the ear
          as hard as he can, and rips the ear off. Ted screams as
          loud as he can. Robert looks at him, holding the ear.

          Ted reaches the door, climbs up onto the chair, and turns
          the doorknob. He opens the door, and exits out into the
          hallway. After a beat, he re-enters, grabs his severed
          ear, and exits again.

          Ted nervously moves down the hallway toward the front
          door. He has it in sight on the far end of the living
          room, but when he gets closer to the living room doorway,
          he sees that Donny is sitting in an armchair, watching
          The Incredible Hulk (the old TV show). Ted darts back
          into the hallway before he's seen, but in the process,
          bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick
          knacks on it. One of them, a small ceramic penguin,
          falls over, making a sound. Donny turns and looks in the
          direction of the hallway.

          Ted looks panicky, not knowing what to do. After a beat,
          Donny leans forward as if he's about to get up.

           Okay.
          Ted breathes a sigh of relief, and walks the other way
          down the hall. He passes a door. He opens it, but it's
          just a storage closet. He's about to shut it, but
          notices a stapler amidst the odds and ends. He hastily
          begins stapling his ear back on.

          ANGLE BACK ON TED, who puts on last staple in.
          Satisfied, he exits the closet and continues down the

          He pauses, then gets into the car and sits down next to

          Ted runs through Donny's legs, and out into the hall. He
          races for the living room and the exit, but Robert steps
          in front of the door, blocking him.

          Robert turns the deadbolt on the door, locking it. Ted
          turns and bolts in the other direction back down the
          hallway, but sees Donny heading for him. Ted ducks into
          the dining room, as Donny lunges for him and misses.

          He's approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is
          opposing traffic moving in the other direction.
                         
                         
          EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
          Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding
          clipping one of the cars. A moment later, John and Lori
          come racing out of the tunnel. However, a truck drives
          through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks.
                         
                          LORI
           Shit!
                         
          She pounds on the steering wheel, frantically willing the
          truck to get out of the way. Finally it does, and they
          continue on into the city.

          Donny's car races through the streets, pursued by John
          and Lori, who are catching up again, but are still a ways
          behind.
                         
          INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Ted is still on the floor on the passenger's seat side.
          He looks around, and spots a "Club" underneath the seat.
          He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted
          grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing
          at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap
          Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few
          of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted
          away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then,
          with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in
          front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering
          wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles
          into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but
          can't.

          EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
                         
          Donny's car swerves out of control, veering up the
          street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it
          impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop.
          Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the
          back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of
          glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles
          for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit.
          TED'S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly.
          That little rip has done something... He shakes it off,
          and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles
          out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase
          Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door
          slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and
          disappears inside.
          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind
          Donny's car. They hurry out, just in time to see Donny
          and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the
          sidewalk after them.
                         
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND AREA - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an
          escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a
          ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red
          metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs
          on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his
          larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him
          down a bit.
                         
          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through
          the garage door, and running inside. They look around
          for a beat. ANGLE ON ROBERT, who turns and sees them
          (Donny has already made it over the fence). ANGLE BACK
          ON JOHN.
                         
           ROBERT (O.S.)
           NO!!
                         
          John and Lori turn just in time to see Robert charging at
          them!
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           You can't have my teddy bear!!
                         
          When Robert reaches John, John knocks him down with one
          punch to the face. Robert collapses. Lori and John look
          down at him.
                         
                          LORI

           Come on!
                         
          John and Lori run up the ramp, leaving a stunned Robert
          behind. When they reach the red fence, they look around,
          but it's unclear which way Ted and Donny have gone. John
          continues up the ramp (in the wrong direction) with Lori
          just behind him.

          Ted runs as fast as his stubby legs will carry him.
          Donny is in pursuit, and getting closer. The chase moves
          past a concession area, and up a few flights of stairs.
                         
                         
          EXT. UPPER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Ted runs out onto the upper level, and stops. The camera
          PIVOTS 180 DEGREES and ascends to reveal the expanse of
          FENWAY PARK down below. A few lights are on, and one
          lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt. Donny emerges from
          the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it. Ted sprints
          past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He
          has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted
          scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto
          the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED'S POV, it's
          a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't
          quite reach. Donny glances down at the drop for a beat,
          then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted.
          Ted climbs farther up the tower.
                         
          INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS

          run down the aisle, looking around with desperation.

          John turns and sees the drama playing out on the distant
          lighting tower.
                         
                          JOHN

          Ted is starting to gain ground, but he slips, and falls
          back down. He's about to pulls himself up again, when
          Donny grabs one of his legs.

          EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
          Ted struggles to pull himself from Donny's grasp, but he
          can't. CLOSE UP ON TED'S SIDE - The small rip from
          earlier begins to tear again. CLOSE UP ON TED'S FACE -
          His eyes go wide, and for a moment, his face freezes with
          fear. TED'S POV - His vision swims a bit more. He knows
          this is not good...

          The struggle continues. As Ted tries to pull himself
          free, the rip gets bigger. He reacts again, and again we
          see his vision swimming even more.

          EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
          Donny makes one final reach for Ted. He grabs Ted by the
          foot again, and pulls hard. With one great RRRIIIIIIP,
          Ted tears into two pieces. As John watches in shock, Ted
          falls through the air in SLO-MOTION, a shower of white
          stuffing descending with him. Lori watches with a hand
          over her mouth. The two halves of Ted land, along with
          the scattered white stuffing. Donny, still hanging,
          stares down at the fallen teddy bear. He starts pulling
          himself back over the ledge.
                         
          We lead and follow John as he runs back down through the
          stadium with desperate numbness. Lori climbs over the
          edge of the seating area, and runs toward him as well.
          ANGLE BACK ON DONNY, who pulls himself back over into the
          upper seating area. He hears the sound of a cop siren,
          and peers over the edge of the stadium. Seeing a cop car
          pull up far below, he makes a break for it.

          thread, and John puts Ted on the table. Lori starts to
          sew him up as John watches intently.

           Just try. Please. Just try.
                         
          She continues sewing, until she is all finished. They
          wait. Ted still does not move. John and Lori lower
          their heads.

          John sits on the couch, head in hands. Ted still lies on
          the coffee table. Lori enters with a blanket, and drapes
          it around him. She sits down next to him, bringing part
          of the blanket around herself. She places a hand on his
          shoulder.
                         
                          LORI
           John... I'm sorry. You did everything
           you could. I'm... I'm just so sorry.
                         
          She gently puts an arm around him. There is a
          thunderclap outside. John does not react.

          John is asleep, but we see that Lori is still lying
          awake. She sighs restlessly, and gets up. She walks
          over to the window, and looks out.

          ANGLE UPWARD - We see a cloudy sky, much like the one
          from that night when John was a child. As before, there
          is a small clear patch in the center. A shooting star
          whizzes by through the opening.

          Lori's eyes widen a bit in recognition. She stares at
          the shooting star for a beat, then closes her eyes and
          makes a wish...

          John wakes up, looks around groggily, then remembers. He
          gets out of bed, and walks toward the living room.

          He pauses for a beat... and walks in. The blanket is
          where it was left. John slowly removes it. Ted is still
          motionless. John lowers his head sadly. Suddenly, Ted's
          eyes snap open.

          cheering crowd. Ted waves happily to John, who waves
          back. John and Lori run down the aisle joyfully, passing
          pews full of people from the movie: Lori's co-workers,
