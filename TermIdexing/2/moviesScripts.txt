At the very edge of hearing, the tone of human VOICES.  
     Unintelligible, babbling, eerie.  Then a loud FLAPPING SOUND.  It 
     shifts from one side of the theater to the other, like something 
     moving among the wall hangings.

     As the TITLE appears, the noise mounts, drowning out the VOICES,
     agitated, becoming violent, banging... inhuman.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. HOUSING PROJECT, CHARLESTOWN, MASSACHUSETTS - DAY

     ON a housing project in the industrial outskirts of Boston.  The
     BANGING seems to flutter away, leading us along, searching... to a 
     tiny balcony, one of dozens, ten stories up.  And there, the source 
     of the sound --

     -- A SHEET, snapping in the wind.  The umbrella-like clothes line 
     on which it hangs bangs against a dirty glass door as if trying to 
     get in.

     THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR a woman paces inside, agitated.  The VOICES 
     rise over the banging, becoming intelligible --

     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY

     -- becoming a fight.  JANE, 30s, dark-haired, furious, wheels
     across a diminutive, neat, but poor living room.

                               JANE
                   It'll take a month to probate the
                   will, Nell!  A month!  Even if
                   Mother left you something, you
                   won't get it in time to pay the
                   rent.  So instead of complaining,
                   you should be thanking Lou for
                   getting you these two weeks to get
                   Mother's things packed.

     At first we can't even see who she's yelling at.  At first we don't
     even notice her.  Then we do...

     Holding herself, in a dim corner away from the light, small, plain,
     like a part of the faded room is ELEANOR VANCE, 20's -- Nell.
     She stares at the door.  The clothes line raps at the begrimed
     glass.

                               JANE (cont'd)
                   Nell?

     The wind dies, the banging stops.  Nell seems to hear Jane and 
     peers over at her, then across the room to Jane's bored husband,
     LOU.  He's turning a Franklin Mint commemorative coin set in his
     hands, studying it.

                               LOU
                   You're still going to have to
                   settle with your mother's landlord 
                   on the back rent.

     Nell watches Jane's little boy, RICHIE.  Unpacified by the 
     cartoons on the TV, he plows a plastic tank across a shelf through 
     neat rows of delicate PORCELAIN DOLLS.

                               NELL
                   I'm not going to stay.  I'll get a 
                   job.  I'll get my own apartment.

     Richie knocks a porcelain DOLL off, and it breaks all over the 
     carpet.  His parents don't notice.  But Nell feels it in the soul.  
     Richie stops.  A long beat.  He looks at her, insolent, then plows 
     on with his tank.

                               JANE
                   Nell.  A job?  Two months and
                   where is this job?  You have no
                   degree, you've never worked --

     Nell explodes in outraged fury, startling us.

                               NELL
                   -- I've never worked? --

                               JANE
                   You have no experience in the
                   world... the regular world.  What 
                   would you put on a resume?
                          (beat, softening)
                   Now we all appreciate what you did 
                   for Mother.  Isn't that right, 
                   Lou?

                               LOU
                   Eleven years.  Long time.

                               JANE
                   That's why we've been talking.
                   With me getting more time in
                   Accessories, and Lou at the shop 
                   all day, we need somebody to take 
                   care of Richie, do a little 
                   cleaning and cooking.  And in 
                   return you can have the extra 
                   room.

     She goes to Lou, puts a hand on his shoulder, proud of her 
     generosity.  All Nell can do is stare.

     And then: KNOCK KNOCK.  Like a shot Nell is out of the chair and
     turning for a set of FRENCH DOORS across the room.  It's all 
     reflex.  Nell catches herself.

     KNOCK KNOCK.  Richie, lying on the couch like he's sick, raps on 
     the wall with a wooden CANE and squeals:

                               RICHIE
                   Eleanor, help me!  I've got to 
                   pee!

     Nell REACTS, but rather than being amused or annoyed, a wave of 
     TRAUMA flickers over her face.  The reaction is so strong we 
     instantly know something is very wrong.

                               LOU
                   Richie, knock it off before I beat 
                   the crap out of you!

     Nell turns away, sick, breathing hard.

     Jane picks up a JEWELRY BOX from a dresser.

                               JANE
                   You're sure this is all of 
                   Mother's jewelry?  The lawyer said 
                   to make sure we took it to him...
                          (beat)
                   He said there might be some 
                   antique pieces.  Have you seen
                   anything?  Some of it might be
                   valuable.

     Nell knows what is going to happen to that jewelry.  Jane no longer 
     can bear the weight of Nell's stare, checks her watch.  She nods at 
     Lou.  Lou rises, pocketing the coin set.  Richie follows him out.

                               JANE (cont'd)
                   Think about our offer, Nell.  You 
                   don't know how hard it is out 
                   there.

     INT. NELL'S KITCHEN - DAY

     Nell rams through the door into the small kitchen, spotless, empty.
     And then bursts into tears.  Shaking, she digs in her back pocket 
     and pulls out a FINE FILIGREE NECKLACE.  Her mother's.  It's from 
     an age gone by.

     Clutching the necklace, she goes back out the door.

     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Nell crosses the living room straight for the closed French doors, 
     the glass obscured by gauze curtains.  She throws them open and 
     enters --

     INT. SICK ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- what once was a dining room.  Transformed into a sick room.  
     Drawn shades.  Dim.  The first traces of dust.

     Nell lingers in the doorway a beat, daunted.

     A perfectly made bed.  The PILLOW, however retains the IMPRESSION 
     of a head.  Lodged between the bed and a nightstand, a CANE.  On 
     the opposite side of the bed is a plastic toilet.  I.V. stand.  
     Shrouded white shapes.

     On the wall above the bed, a framed needlepoint counsels: A PLACE 
     FOR EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE.  A bit of wisdom.  A way 
     to live a life.

     A way Nell has lived for too long.  Seeing it galvanizes her into
     movement.  She goes to an old armoire, a medicine chest, opens it,
     removes a BOTTLE OF TYLENOL WITH CODEINE and marches out.

     INT. LIVING ROOM, NELL'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Nell closes the doors on the chamber of horrors, exhales.  She has 
     been holding her breath.

     INT. NELL'S KITCHEN - DAY

     Nell sits at her tiny kitchen table, water glass and Tylenol in 
     front of her.  The necklace dangles from her fingers.  She stares, 
     mesmerized by it.  Then she undoes the hasp.  The clothes line 
     outside BATTERS louder --

     -- and, defiant, Nell puts the necklace on.  She closes her eyes.

     Silence.  The battering has stopped.  A BEAT.  And then the PHONE 
     RINGS.  Nell opens her eyes.  The phone RINGS.  Keeps ringing.  
     Nell, feeling the drug, finds her way to the phone and picks up.

                               NELL
                   Hello?  Yes, this is Eleanor.
                   -- Where?  Yes, it's right here.

     Nell listens for a long moment.  She picks up the classifieds, 
     flips through.  And there it is:

                         TROUBLE SLEEPING?

     WANTED - RESEARCH SUBJECTS.  $900.00/.WEEK + RM.&BD. @ BEAUTIFUL 
     OLD HOUSE IN BERKSHIRES.  PSYCHOLOGY STUDY.

     END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

     INT. PSYCH OBSERVATION LAB - DAY

     The lab feels more like the video center of a security office than 
     a psychologist's laboratory.  Two banks of black and white monitors 
     give us images of men and women, different ages, different races, 
     wired to electrodes.  They are taking psychological tests, although 
     we never see the Testers.  The subjects are working through 
     variations on object manipulation and pattern recognition tests.  
     There are subtle differences between the two banks of monitors.  On 
     the left, the subjects are all twitching at exactly the same time, 
     on the right, the subjects are also twitching, but in no 
     discernible sequence.  The subjects on the left are better able to 
     concentrate on their tasks.  The subjects on the right keep 
     stopping, and going over what they have done.

     Two men, MALCOLM KEOGH, in his 50's, is a graying professor, the 
     head of the department; someone we trust.

     He faces PROFESSOR JAMES MARROW.  He is a man whose confidence 
     rests uneasily on his ambition, and in the tension between the two 
     is the power that makes him the teacher students love.  Right now, 
     though, he is defending himself before a Department Review.  This 
     is not a court martial with judges behind a desk, it's more free 
     form.

     The men are having a fight, and they are watched by OTHER 
     PROFESSORS.

                               MALCOLM
                   It's still an electric shock!

                               MARROW
                   Come on Malcolm, it's only seven
                   ohms, it's nothing, it's like a
                   joy buzzer!  And it's not about
                   the pain, it's about the
                   interference with concentration...

     Malcolm looks at the monitor.  This is Marrow's chance to explain 
     it again.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Look, look at what it does!  The 
                   subjects on the left, because they 
                   anticipate the shocks, make the 
                   adjustment, and lose nothing on 
                   their scores.  The subjects on the 
                   right, because the shocks are 
                   random, can't anticipate, and the 
                   distraction throws them off.

                               MALCOLM
                   Stop defending your science after 
                   the fact, Jim.  The department 
                   protocol for research is very 
                   clear about this, and you violated 
                   the rules.  I know, I know, I know 
                   that "Fear and Performance" is a 
                   big sexy idea, but as long as I'm 
                   chairman here you will need this 
                   department's endorsement to 
                   publish it, and right now I can't 
                   do that.

     At this moment, MARY LAMBRETTA, late 20's, Marrow's pretty T.A., 
     opens the door with an armload of files.  Whatever else she's 
     wearing, she wears glasses.  Marrow, seeing her, motions for her to 
     go away.  He doesn't break eye contact with Malcolm.  Mary 
     hesitates...

                               MARROW
                   Malcolm, this is essential work 
                   I'm doing.  Just think what my 
                   research can do for education.  
                   Elementary school classrooms near 
                   train tracks or airports, where 
                   loud noise is random; this helps 
                   to prove the need for sound 
                   insulation if the children are 
                   ever going to learn to read.

                               MALCOLM
                   And that will be a good place to 
                   end this study.

                               MARROW
                   No, Malcolm!  Individual 
                   performance is only part of it.  I 
                   know why baseball players choke 
                   for no reason, I know why 
                   violinists throw up with fear 
                   before every concert, and need to, 
                   to give a great performance, but 
                   what I want to know is, how fear 
                   works in a group...

                               MALCOLM
                   Not the way you've constructed 
                   your group, it's just not ethical!

                               MARROW
                   But if the group knows it's being 
                   studied as a group, you 
                   contaminate the results.  The 
                   deception is minor.

     Malcolm sees Mary Lambretta.

                               MALCOLM
                   Are you working with her?

                               MARROW
                   Mary, I'll meet you outside.

     She understands, and she closes the door.

                               MALCOLM
                   Why are you working with her?  
                   Mary Lambretta was thrown out of 
                   the department for trying to get a 
                   Ph.D. in psychic studies.

                               MARROW
                   And after she was thrown out, she 
                   needed a job.

                               MALCOLM
                   You don't believe in the 
                   paranormal.

                               MARROW
                   No, but she does, and that's all 
                   that matters.

                               MALCOLM
                   Does she know that's why you're 
                   using her?

                               MARROW
                   No.

                               MALCOLM
                   I, I just can't...

                               MARROW
                   She needed a job, Malcolm.  And 
                   she's smart.  And she helps me.

                               MALCOLM
                   I have a bad feeling about what 
                   you're doing.

                               MARROW
                   This is the last chapter.  Please, 
                   please give me clearance.  It's 
                   for science.

     Marrow waits.

                               MALCOLM
                   I'm gonna hate myself for this.

     But he nods.  Permission granted.

                               MARROW
                   Thank you.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LAB - DAY

     They open the door.  They walk out.  Mary is there.  She closes her 
     eyes, and does a gypsy voice.

                               MARY
                   I see a hostile man... he's (she 
                   describes him).  The hostile man 
                   does not believe in Madame Velka.

     This relieves the pressure.  Malcolm is not listening anymore and
     storms off.

                               MARY
                   You know what he's really upset 
                   about?

                               MARROW
                   What?

                               MARY
                   You're going to publish, he's 
                   going to perish... And why did you 
                   hire me for this?

     Marrow has a sly smile.  They go into his office through another 
     door in the lab.

     INT. MARROW'S OFFICE - DAY

     Long, narrow, badly lit, it's filled with filing cabinets, stacks 
     of unread textbooks still in publisher's plastic, a desk with 
     computer.  As soon as they enter, Mary looks at the phone.

                               MARY
                   It's for you.

     And then the phone rings.  He doesn't pick it right up, he lets it
     ring.

                               MARROW
                   You hear the vibrations in the 
                   wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in 
                   the wires, you feel it.  I could 
                   test it.

                               MARY
                   Test it.

     The phone still rings.  Marrow answers.

                               MARROW
                   Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.

                               MARY
                   How'd I know it was for you?

                               MARROW
                          (quickly)
                   Because it's my phone.
                          (back to the phone)
                   Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the 
                   boxes inside, thank you.  See you 
                   soon.  Thank you.

     He hangs up.

     Marrow is trying to read the first file as he goes to his desk.  
     Mary shows him a huge CORKBOARD covered with photos, articles, and 
     various items.

                               MARY
                   Here's how they're organized.  
                   Groups of five, very different 
                   personalities: scored all over the 
                   Kiersey Temperament Sorter just 
                   like you asked for.  And they all 
                   score high on the insomnia charts.

                               MARROW
                   Good.

     A PHOTO OF NELL falls on the floor.  Marrow scoops it up.  He holds 
     the photo of Nell up to Mary, and look at the written notes and 
     studies the graphs that go with it.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   This is correct?

                               MARY
                   Her mother died two months ago.  
                   She says she really wants to do 
                   this.  I didn't know if it'd be 
                   taking advantage...

     Marrow considers the lonely image for a long moment and then looks 
     at the graph of her test scores.

                               MARROW
                          (meaning the graph,
                           not the face)
                   What a beautiful profile.  How do 
                   you feel about her?  What does 
                   your intuition say?

     Mary balks at his teasing.

                               MARY
                   I put my favorites on the top.

     Marrow continues to study the files.

                               MARROW (OC)
                   Okay... this one's good... 
                   Extrovert Feeler... Okay... This 
                   one I like, too...

     We don't pay as much attention now to the cork board as to other
     images on the wall.  We find clinical-looking shots from Stanley
     Milgram's experiments: subjects appearing to scream in response to
     electrical shock.

     Rows of weeping prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment.

     Photos of victims crushed under the stands of a soccer stadium, the
     aftermath of a riot.  A picture of the Fuhrer before his mesmerized
     masses.  Mary opens a large envelope.  She takes out a photograph 
     that we can't see.

                               MARY
                   What's this?
                          (has to get his
                           attention)
                   What's this... this picture?

                               MARROW
                   That?  That's Hill House.

                               MARY
                   This is where we're going?

                               MARROW
                   Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?

     Mary studies the picture, and she can't answer him.  In her 
     glasses, we get the thinnest reflection of the photograph, a 
     glimpse of dark brick and high chimneys.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell, in a rust-wormed old Buick, glances from the road to 
     computer-drawn DIRECTIONS TO HILL HOUSE.  She HUMS A TUNE, soft, 
     lonely, like a lullaby but eerie, off-key.

     EXT. ROUTE 39 - DAY

     The car speeds down the country road, past old stone walls, out 
     into rolling meadow, its winding route taking it across the western
     Berkshires, farther and farther into the glorious hills.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Countryside speeds by.  She passes an antique store in a barn.  A
     handpainted sign warns MELBY'S APPLE FARM 100 YARDS.  Nell grabs 
     for the window handle, letting in air.

     She snorts, smelling, breathing like it was the first time in her
     life... sounding like a pig.  And it makes her burst out in
     embarrassing, animal laughter.

     EXT. HILLSDALE - DAY (ESTABLISHING)

     The white-steepled church, five stores and gas station of Hillsdale
     lie in a forgotten notch in the hills.

     EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

     Nell is pumping gas at a country station.  She is alone at the 
     pump.  As she finishes, she hears a BABY CRYING.  She looks up.  
     She is immediately drawn by the sound.

     She moves to a car at another pump.  The car is empty.  The windows 
     are rolled up.  She peers into the car, through the window, and 
     sees a toddler in a car seat.  The child is crying.  Nell looks 
     around, no one is there.  She makes faces at the baby, coos to it.

                               NELL
                   Hello Baby...

     She does a peek-a-boo game, and the baby stops crying, the baby 
     even starts to giggle.

     A VOICE from behind.

                               MOTHER (O.S.)
                   What's going on, what happened?

     Nell turns.  The Mother is a busy country mom, arms filled with 
     stuff from the gas station's market.

                               NELL
                   She's okay.  She woke up and she 
                   saw she was alone.

     The mother has the car open and the baby is smiling now.

                               MOTHER
                   Say thank you, Spencer.
                          (too much of an
                           explanation)
                   I was getting her something to 
                   drink.  She's been crying all 
                   day...

                               NELL
                   That's all right.

                               MOTHER
                   Of course you know, how many 
                   children do you have?

                               NELL
                   None.

                               MOM
                   Then you're a teacher.  Nursery 
                   school.

                               NELL
                   No.

                               MOM
                   You just... you seem like someone 
                   who takes care of children, lots 
                   of children.

                               NELL
                   Maybe... maybe someday.  I'd like 
                   that.

     The woman smiles in something like sympathy, and gets in her car.  
     When she does, we see a friendly GAS STATION ATTENDANT appear 
     behind Nell.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Umm, I'm a little lost.

                               GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                   Where you going?

     Nell takes out her computer drawn directions and an old map.

                               NELL
                   They sent me directions and I've 
                   got a map, but it's kind of 
                   confusing.  Here... it's a place 
                   called Hill House?

     His helpful attitude changes dramatically.

                               GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                   Hill House.

     He takes the map book and tears out the page and crumples it up.

                               NELL
                   What are you doing?

                               GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                   You don't want to go there.

     He turns abruptly and walks away.

                               NELL
                   Did I say something wrong to you?

     Nell slams the Buick door, and breathing hard, starts the engine.  
     She gets control, and puts the car in gear.  She's shaken.  Badly.

     EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY

     Nell's Buick bounces over a country road.  The car works its way up
     into the steep, switchbacking hills.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell looks out at the forest, feels a chill.  The road is more like 
     a tunnel through the forest than a road.

     EXT. HILLS - DAY

     Nell's car speeds through the trees, climbing the hills, higher and
     higher into the awesome solitude.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell takes a final switchback, and something off to the right 
     catches her eye, then is gone in the trees.  She watches again for 
     it.  There.  A glimpse of a gray stone property wall set back 
     twenty yards from the road.

     There it is again.  Moss-greened, twenty feet high, a wicked array 
     of iron spikes and glass mortared atop it.

     And then out of the tangled forest in front of her looms a pair of
     immense stone pillars.  Between them, a steel GATE as high as the 
     wall, chained and padlocked.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE GATE - DAY

     The gate stands immense.  Silent.  Forbidding.  Beyond them a 
     gravel drive curves away through the trees.  Nell kills her car, 
     gets out, instructions in hand.  No one in sight.  A long beat.  
     She reaches in and blows the HORN.

     The HORN shatters the air, rackets off the trees beyond the gate,
     echoing.  Silence.

     Nell blows the HORN a sustained staccato in annoyance.  The echo
     replies in a terrible, deafening battering of sound.  Nell covers 
     her ears.  Silence once again.

     In a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it.  It's
     locked good.  She turns --

     -- and there is a man right behind her.  It is MR. DUDLEY, his hair
     tied back like an ex-hippie.  He stands between Nell and her open
     car door, weed spear in hand.  He smiles at her -- rough, dirty,
     massive.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   What do you want?

                               NELL
                   Oh!  You scared me.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Me?  No.  What are you doing here?

                               NELL
                   Are you Mister Dudley, the
                   caretaker?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the 
                   caretaker.  What are you doing 
                   here?

                               NELL
                   I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm 
                   supposed to check in with Mrs. 
                   Dudley up at the house.  Is she 
                   here?

     She hands him the directions.  He glances at them.  She uses the
     distraction to get into her car.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Maybe she is...

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell looks at the gate, some part of her aware it's a point of no-
     return.  Mr. Dudley eases over to her window.  Mr. Dudley gives her 
     one last look and goes to the gate.  He produces a keyring and 
     undoes the padlock.

                               NELL
                   Why do you need a chain like that?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   That's a good question.  What is 
                   it about fences?  Sometimes a 
                   locked chain makes people on both 
                   sides of the fence just a little 
                   more comfortable.  Why would that 
                   be?

     He unwinds the enormous chain, heavy turn after heavy turn.  The 
     gates swing in, revealing HILL HOUSE.

                               NELL
                   Is there something about the 
                   house?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.

     Grinning, Dudley steps aside and Nell rolls through.  And at that 
     he just grins wider.  Nell pulls away.  Disturbed, she watches him 
     in the rearview mirror.  She turns and in front of her sprawls Hill 
     House.  At center, the features of the oldest part of the House 
     dwarf all others: towering, eye-like windows and the jaws of a 
     Grand Entry with carved ebony doors.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DAY

     The car rumbles up the drive toward the carport.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - DAY

     Nell stops the car in front of the entrance, right inside the 
     carport.  In the silence all we can hear is her breathing.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     Her car sits in front of the house, tiny, alone.  Its brake lights 
     go off.

     The finger-like pillars of the car port seem like a hand pinning 
     the car in place under the House's gaze.

     Nell gets out of the car.

     Nell stares, daunted... yet there is something about the House.  A
     romance in its lilac heavy Gothic decay.  Nell feels it, is drawn 
     to it.

     EXT. GRAND ENTRY - DAY

     Nell, suitcase in hand, climbs the steps to the front doors.  On 
     closer inspection, the snaking shapes of the carved doors depict a 
     Garden of Eden.  At center on the knocker, a tarnished silver Adam 
     takes the forbidden fruit from his counterpart Eve.

     Nell lifts Adam and knocks heavily.  There is no answer.  Nell 
     looks around for some sign of life.

     Off to one side is a LADDER and PAINT CANS.  Somebody must've been
     touching up the window trim.

     When she looks back the door is AJAR a fraction of an inch.

                               NELL
                   Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?  Mrs. 
                   Dudley, are you here?  Anybody?

     Tentative, she pushes it open into --

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- a vast entry towering away to a ceiling lost in shadow far 
     above.  Rays of light filter through floor-to-ceiling curtains.  
     Doors lead off in a half dozen directions.

     Every piece of woodwork or plaster in the house is carved, 
     filigreed, painted or ornamented in wild, ornate fashion.  It 
     overwhelms the eye.

                               NELL
                   Wow...

     She turns around, sets her suitcase on the marble floor.  A short
     hallway straight ahead seems to let onto some vast space, dimly 
     lit.

     And then Nell hears a SOUND.  Carrying through the empty halls from
     some distant place: a low, plaintive MOAN.

     Nell freezes.  The MOANING stops.  Nell strains her ears.  And then 
     the MOAN again.  It comes from the short hallway ahead.  Nell 
     starts for it.  The Moan stops.

     INT. HALL FROM ENTRY TO GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell moves down the hall.  It's dim, stale, lined with pier tables,
     candelabra.

                               NELL
                   Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?

     Her voice echoes from the room beyond.  She follows her own voice
     into --

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- A long, oval great hall.  Passages and doors lead off in all
     directions to God-knows-where.  A double-grand staircase at the far 
     end ascends to a landing shrouded in darkness before turning up the 
     next floor.  Magnificent ANIMAL HEADS carved on the newel posts 
     glare at her.

     Nell makes her way past clusters of furniture, stops at the center.
     Silence.  An ENORMOUS FIREPLACE dominates one wall.  Large enough 
     to stand in.  An iron mesh SCREEN hangs in its mouth.  Mantle and 
     chimney rise in dark, baroque masonry, becoming lost in the shadows 
     above.

     The MOANING sound.  Nell spins away from the fireplace.  The sound 
     rises from the door at the very back of the hall.  Nell takes a 
     step toward it.

                               NELL
                   Mrs. Dudley?

     She moves up to the door, puts a hand out to it.  The MOANING 
     rises. Nell pushes through --

     INT. 1ST FLOOR HALLWAY TOWARDS KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into a much narrower, curving hallway.  Doors all along it.  The
     sound comes from the door right there across from the one Nell just
     came through.  She flings it open --

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- and comes through into a vast kitchen.  A woman in black with 
     her back to Nell stands at a counter.  The moaning comes from a
     disreputable old CAN OPENER.

     Nell breaths, feels stupid.  The woman senses her, turns from her 
     cans of potatoes.  She is MRS. DUDLEY, sallow, unsmiling.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   It's make the soup or answer the 
                   door.  Can't do both.

                               NELL
                   Mrs. Dudley.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   So far.

     Mrs. Dudley wipes her hands, regards Nell, nods.

                               NELL
                   I'm Eleanor Vance, I'm with --

                               MRS.  DUDLEY
                   -- Dr. Marrow's group.  You're the 
                   first.

     Mrs. Dudley just stares with her sunken face.  It unsettles Nell.

                               MRS. DUDLEY (cont'd)
                   I'll show you your room.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY/MEZZANINE - DAY

     Mrs. Dudley glides up the stairs.  Nell follows, hoisting her 
     suitcase after her.  It appears the mezzanine ahead leads to a 
     hallway.  But as we draw closer what we thought was a hallway is an 
     ENORMOUS OIL PAINTING.  In it stands a man, his features lost in 
     the shadows above, only his body visible.

     The nameplate reads HUGH CRAIN.

                               NELL
                   Hugh Crain.

     Nell looks up: Mrs. Dudley waits coldly at the top of the stairs.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY

     Mrs. Dudley leads Nell down a curved hallway, over aged Persian
     carpets and turns to a door on her left.  She throws it open, 
     stands back.  Nell enters.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - DAY

     Nell lowers her suitcase.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   The Purple Room.  You're going to 
                   be the first visitors that Hill 
                   House has had since Mister Crain 
                   died.

     The room is spacious, in a rococo gothic style with low-relief
     woodwork on the walls rising to a dark, coffered, ceiling of carved
     ivory.  A king-size bed, furniture, all in blue purple.  An open 
     door gives a glimpse of a bathroom.

     A large fireplace dominates one wall.  Its mantle is carved with 
     the faces of children, happy, at play, alive.  Nell touches the 
     wood, loving.

                               NELL
                   They're so beautiful.  Aren't 
                   they?

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.

                               NELL
                   Well, I've never lived with 
                   beauty.  You must love working 
                   here.

     Mrs. Dudley peers at her.  A beat.  And then, cryptic:

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   It's a job.  I keep banker's 
                   hours.  I set dinner on the dining 
                   room sideboard at six.  You can 
                   serve yourselves.  Breakfast is 
                   ready at nine.  I don't wait on 
                   people.  I don't stay after 
                   dinner.  Not after it begins to 
                   get dark.  I leave before dark 
                   comes.  We live in town.  Nine 
                   miles.  So there won't be anyone 
                   around if you need help.  We 
                   couldn't even hear you, in the 
                   night.

                               NELL
                   Why would we --

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   -- no one could.  No one lives any 
                   nearer than town.  No one will 
                   come any nearer than that.  In the 
                   night.  In the dark.

     And with that Mrs. Dudley grins, rictus-like.  She turns and closes 
     the door after her.

     Nell stands there a long moment, the room silent, heavy, old.  She 
     goes to the windows, peers out.  Nothing but forest for miles.  The
     sun is setting.

     Nell removes her windbreaker, opens her suitcase, takes out a 
     blouse and skirt.  Decent enough clothes, but cheap, the tags still 
     on them.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY

     Nell emerges from her room in her new clothes.  The hallway curves 
     away into the distance, lined with massive, ornate doorframes like 
     the one to her room.

     Trying to get a better look, Nell searches the walls for a light
     switch, but can't find one.  She follows the chair rail back to --

     INT. MEZZANINE - SUNSET (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the mezzanine at the top of the stairs.  She searches in vain 
     for a light switch there.  Finally she spots a set of curtains and 
     slings them open.

     The light, late-day though it is, makes her wince.  The window 
     looks down on the driveway.  Outside a BEIGE CAR crunches over the 
     gravel.  Somebody else has arrived.

     Nell watches the car move past, trying to get a glimpse of the 
     driver, but from up here, all she can see is roof.

                               NELL
                   Finally.

     She backs away from the window, spins around --

     -- and out of the darkness, powerful, mad, looms the visage of Hugh
     Crain.  It is the painting.  It is only from up here on the second 
     floor with this curtain open that the FACE is visible in the late-
     day sunlight.

     Despite the artist's discretion, the lines in the man's skin, his
     eyes, his posture, cry of unspeakable sickness.

     Unconsciously, Nell takes a step back.  In the far b.g., near the 
     end of one of the halls, a DOOR stands open, the second or third 
     set of doors in the Gothic Hallway left of the painting.  Just as 
     it starts to come into view, and we're starting to see it, it 
     swings silently shut.

     But Nell has caught the movement out of the corner of her eye.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - DAY

     Nell stares down the long hallway.  Which door was it?

                               NELL
                   Hello?

     No response.  She starts down the hall, slow at first, then faster.

     She passes door after door, shadow after shadow, and as she nears 
     the end of the hall... there is no door here.  Not within 20 feet 
     of, where we thought we just saw it.

     A WHISPER.  VOICES.  Nell backs away.  And then LAUGHTER.  Behind 
     her.  It's coming from another stairwell.  Very real... and very 
     human.

     INT. BACK STAIRWAY - DAY

     Nell looks down from the top of the stairs.  Below Mrs. Dudley and
     THEO, 20s, exotic, sophisticated, in Vera Wang leather, wrestle with
     a pile of designer luggage.  Theo peers up.  She's dark, sexy in an
     amused, worldly way: someone who has seen and done it all.

                               THEO
                   You may think I have a sickness 
                   about packing, but asking people 
                   to help me shlep the stuff I take 
                   with me everywhere is a cheap and 
                   exploitative way of making new 
                   friends.  My name's Theo.

     Theo foists a very heavy bag off on Mrs. Dudley who looks like she's
     been handed a snake.  That makes Nell smile.  She comes running down 
     to help with the bags.

                               NELL
                   I'm Eleanor but everyone calls me 
                   Nell.  Eleanor Vance.  Nell.  I'm 
                   really glad you're here.  Really.

     Theo is a little thrown by Nell's gushing.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   What a beautiful jacket.

     Theo looks her over... and understands.  Nell is desperate to be 
     liked.

                               THEO
                   And what you're wearing, that's 
                   great, too.

                               NELL
                   This?  It's from a thrift shop.

                               THEO
                   What did it cost?

                               NELL
                   Fifteen dollars.

                               THEO
                   That'd be seventy in New York.  
                   You stole it!

                               NELL
                          (embarrassed by the 
                           simple truth)
                   It's all I could afford.

                               THEO
                   Wait.  You're not wearing that 
                   ironically?  This is really you?

                               NELL
                   I don't know what you mean.

     Mrs. Dudley, walking ahead, looks back at them.  Then continues up. 
     Theo makes a face at Mrs. Dudley's back.  Nell smiles, a little.

                               THEO
                   A week.  You and I?  We're going 
                   to have fun.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - DAY

     Mrs. Dudley opens the door, letting Theo and Nell into a large 
     bedroom, a mirror-image twin of Nell's room, except it's decorated 
     in rich red-orange velvets.

                               THEO
                   This is so twisted.

     She dumps her stuff on the floor, grabs a banister on the four-
     poster bed, swings cat-like onto its high mattress.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   I set dinner on the dining room 
                   sideboard at six.

     Mrs. Dudley lays Theo's suitcase on a luggage stand.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   Breakfast is at nine.  I don't 
                   stay after dinner.  Not after it 
                   begins to get dark.

     Theo, back to Mrs.  Dudley, rolls her eyes at Nell.

                               MRS. DUDLEY (cont'd)
                   I leave, before dark.  So there 
                   won't be anyone around if you need 
                   help.

                               NELL
                   We couldn't even hear you.

     Mrs. Dudley looks up at Nell who mimics her scary smile.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   No one could.  No one lives any 
                   nearer than town.

                               NELL
                   No one will come any nearer than 
                   that.

     Mrs. Dudley smiles at Nell, but it's softer than before.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   In the night.  In the dark.

     Theo leans on the bed, musing at the exchange.  And then Mrs. Dudley
     backs out of the room, shuts the door.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   My room is right next door.  I 
                   think we share a bathroom.

     Theo has an interesting eye on Nell, she's studying her.

                               THEO
                   Don't worry, I probably won't be 
                   in here much.  Light sleeper.

                               NELL
                   That's why we're here.

                               THEO
                   What do you do?

                               NELL
                   I'm between jobs right now.  My 
                   last job... it... the person I was 
                   working for... the job ended.  
                   Over.  So... And you?

                               THEO
                   That depends.

     Theo pops a dress bag on the bed, unzips it.  Theo takes off her 
     coat, and is only wearing a black bra underneath.  Nell reacts, 
     turns away.  Back to the camera, Theo flicks off her bra, stretches.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   I'm supposed to be an artist, but 
                   I've been really distracted from 
                   work by love.  Do you know what I 
                   mean?

                               NELL
                   Not really.

                               THEO
                   Don't tell me Boston is different 
                   from New York.

                               NELL
                          (she knows this 
                           from magazines)
                   Ohh, sure, you have trouble with
                   commitment.

                               THEO
                   My boyfriend thinks so, my 
                   girlfriend doesn't.  If we could 
                   all live together... but... they 
                   hate each other.  It's hard to be 
                   Miss Perversity when you're the 
                   only one at the party.  D'you know 
                   what I mean?

                               NELL
                   No.

                               THEO
                          (delighted)
                   A blank canvas!  I could paint 
                   your portrait, directly on you.  
                   Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands?  
                   Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where 
                   do you live?

                               NELL
                   I don't have anyone.
                          (beat, lying)
                   But I do have a little apartment 
                   of my own.  It has a little flower 
                   garden.  You can just see the 
                   ocean.  At night, when the wind 
                   comes in just right, you can hear 
                   the buoys in the harbor.

     Nell peeks, sees Theo is decent, turns around.

                               THEO
                   That sounds really nice.  You're 
                   lucky.  But you know that.

     Theo comes over, straightens Nell's seams; this is an intimate,
     forward gesture.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                          (with meaning)
                   Come on, we've seen enough of the 
                   bedroom for now.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - DUSK

     The long hall is lost in shadow, its long rows of doors waiting in 
     the deadening silence.  A lamp on a pier table casts a small pool of 
     light.  The walls glow in rich tones, the low-relief carvings a 
     worm's-wood of shadow.

     Nell runs her hand over a wall panel as Theo peeks into a 
     neighboring room.

                               NELL
                   So much carving.  It's everywhere.  
                   On everything.

     Theo starts down the hall.  Nell follows.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DUSK

     Nell and Theo enter a room just off the landing, a lavish parlor 
     with the omnipresent panelled walls, lush red carpet, velvet 
     curtains sweeping floor to ceiling, heavy pieces of furniture.  Nell 
     watches Theo explore.  As Theo moves through the room, Nell's eye 
     lands on another painting of Hugh Crain.  Inside it's ornate golden 
     framework, distinctive little cherubs are embedded.  Cherubs of 
     Death... She runs her fingers over it.

                               THEO
                   Maybe you shouldn't touch --

     Theo twirls out of the room, Nell, anxious, behind her.

     INT. MEZZANINE - DUSK

     As they come out of Crain's study Theo stops at the top of the 
     stairs, Nell behind her.

                               THEO
                   Jeez.

                               NELL
                   I know.

     They stare out at Hugh Crain, the cracking and shadowing of the 
     swirls of oil that compose his face.  The figure is daunting, but 
     dead.  Just a painting.  Four different hallways lead into the 
     mezzanine, all dark and endless in the stray light.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Maybe we should wait for them 
                   here.

     Theo walks out, swings around.

                               THEO
                   Which one?  Pick any.

     Nell looks from one to another.  She doesn't want to.  But she 
     forces a smile and points to one on the left.  They both disappear 
     into the dark gothic hallway.

     INT. SMALL PARLOR (CONFUSING ROOMS) - DUSK

     Theo breezes into a small parlor with heavy green velvet curtains,
     panelled walls, rich settees.  Other doors lead off the room.  Nell
     follows.

                               THEO
                   This is a serious question, but do 
                   you think the Dudleys ever make 
                   love in this room?  They're alone 
                   in the house, no one watching.  No 
                   one... no one watching.  You can 
                   do what you want.

     Theo goes running for another door and is out.

     Nell, realizing she's being left behind, springs after her into 
     another mysterious hallway --

     INT. STATUARY HALL - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into a wide hall lined with niches and classical statuary.  Theo
     strides down it pointing left and right, bending over, straddling 
     the pieces, provocative:

                               THEO
                   Here.  Here.  Here.
                          (under a leering 
                           gargoyle)
                   Oh yes!  Oh yes oh YES!  Here!

     Nell laughs -- appalled and loving every minute of it.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Can't you just see it?

                               NELL
                   Theo!

     INT. HALL OF MIRRORS - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     Through a narrow passageway, and large double doors they suddenly
     stand at the threshold of a fantastic ballroom lined with mirrors 
     and chandeliers.  Rows of mirror-coated octagonal pillars, rise to a
     vaulted, mirrored ceiling far above.  With the door opening, there's 
     a CLICK, and a mechanism of some sort is activated.  The FLOOR 
     begins to MOVE like a slow turntable.

     Theo comes right up, looks over Nell's shoulder.  Nell steps out.

     She traipses out across the room, her million reflections waltzing
     with her into infinity.  Theo dances after her.  They dance, not 
     quite together.  Nell stops and pronounces:

                               NELL
                   I love this house.  I really love 
                   this house.

                               THEO
                          (gently, recognizes 
                           that Nell is 
                           different)
                   You're okay.

     Nell blushes... and they burst out laughing.  They take off running,
     their reflections with them, stampeding for an archway on the far 
     side of the room and out --

     INT. 1ST FLOOR HALLS (VARIOUS) - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into yet another hallway.  They race down the hall, turn into
     another hall, then another, all dimly lit by the very last rays of
     day, all furnished in the House's dark, impossibly complicated,
     impossibly ornate fashion.  As they go, the mood is growing darker, 
     the women unaware that they are getting lost.

                               THEO
                          (having fun)
                   Rats!  We're rats in a maze!
                   That's what this experiment is
                   going to be!

     They open a door to --

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

     They stand at the end of a long hallway to one of the House's
     forgotten outlying wings.  It is dark.  Too dark.  Nell and Theo 
     regard the darkness.

     At the far end of the hall stand a pair of MAHOGANY DOORS, closed,
     almost black, oily-looking.  Surrounding them, an enormously complex
     geometrical frieze.

     The doors themselves are plain.  In their simplicity there is 
     something about them enormously disturbing.  It is as if the doors 
     are looking back at them, Nell goes cold.  Theo holds herself.

                               NELL
                   We should go back.

     Theo nods.  They turn around, Theo opening what she thinks was the 
     door they came through.

     INT. NARROW STAIRCASE - DUSK

     They hurry down a narrow staircase, Theo first, Nell right behind.

                               NELL
                   Theo, I'm scared --

     They fly down a set of steps, Theo flings open a final door -- and
     SCREAMS!

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT

     The Grand Entry, where they bump into LUKE SANDERSON, 20's, charming
     and cynical.

                               LUKE
                   Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, 
                   I'm your basic tosser-turner, and 
                   you are...

                               NELL
                   Uh... Nell Vance...

                               LUKE
                   And what kind of sleeper?

                               NELL
                   Well, I... uh...

                               LUKE
                   Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.
                          (to Theo)
                   And you?  I'd guess...

                               THEO
                   You'll never guess.

     She won't answer.

     Marrow comes in the front door.  He looks at the house like 
     MacArthur studying a beachhead.

                               MARROW
                   There we are.  You're Eleanor, 
                   you're Luke, you're Theo.

                               ALL
                   Hi... hello... Dr. Marrow...

                               MARROW
                   And this is Todd, he just came up.

     TODD comes in.

                               TODD
                   Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.

                               LUKE
                          (1950's alien 
                           spaceman)
                   Greetings fellow insomniac.

                               TODD
                          (playing)
                   Greetings fellow sheep counter.

                               MARROW
                   And this is my assistant, Mary 
                   Lambretta.

                               LUKE
                   Greetings.

     And Mary enters.  Crossing the threshold, she catches her breath, 
     and when she comes into the hall and sees everyone, she also sees 
     the house in its detail.  And she has a bad feeling.

     Marrow is still putting everyone at ease.

                               MARROW
                   Eleanor, how was the drive?

                               NELL
                   You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.

                               MARROW
                   Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.

                               NELL
                   I'm really... honored to be part 
                   of this study, Jim.

                               MARROW
                   Well... we're glad to have you.

     His smile is devastating.  Nell reddens, instantly taken by Marrow's
     warmth, observant sensitivity.  Theo notices.

                               MARROW
                   Have either of you seen David 
                   Watts?

                               THEO
                   No, but Nell's been here longer 
                   than I have.

                               NELL
                   I only saw Theo drive up.

                               LUKE
                   Who's Watts?

                               MARROW
                   The man who completes the group.

     For a long moment they stand there, silent, looking at each other --
     polite smiles, but awkward, even Marrow.  One by one they all look 
     to him for a cue.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Well, why don't we get some dinner 
                   while we're waiting for him?
                          (beat, backing 
                           through the doors 
                           to the Great Hall)
                   Welcome to Hill House, everyone.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Marrow leads the way across the hall.  The others check out the
     furnishings as they pass.

                               TODD
                   These old Victorian houses are 
                   great, aren't they?

                               LUKE
                          (points to details; 
                           ADJUST FOR SET)
                   It's not Victorian, everyone 
                   thinks that the whole nineteenth 
                   century was Victorian.  This is 
                   gothic, this is English Craftsman, 
                   this is Romanesque.  This is... 
                   insane.  Who lives here?

                               MARROW
                   Nobody.  A local mill owner, Hugh 
                   Crain, built it in 1830.  He had 
                   no heirs, but he put the house in 
                   trust, and the farmland around it, 
                   with the stipulation that it never 
                   be altered or sold.  Crain's 
                   executors made good investments 
                   and for the last hundred and 
                   twenty years, Hill House has taken 
                   care of itself.

     Mary is shaken by the house, but she's honoring Marrow's request.
     Everywhere she looks, she feels the presence of something.

                               TODD
                   So what's this study all about 
                   anyway?  Mary described the kind 
                   of tests we'll be doing, but 
                   didn't fill us in on the big 
                   picture.  She said you needed bad 
                   sleepers, but this wasn't about 
                   curing the problem.

                               MARY
                   I can tell you what this is about.

                               MARROW
                   Eat first, questions later, Mary, 
                   please.

     They exit the hall, Mary and Nell last, and as they do, Nell sees
     Mary's strange look.  She stops.

                               NELL
                   Is something wrong?

                               MARY
                   No.  Just... when I saw your 
                   picture I had a feeling about you, 
                   and now that I meet you, I know I 
                   was right.

                               NELL
                   What?

                               MARY
                   Eat first, questions later.

     And suddenly awkward, Mary exits after the others.

     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     A chandelier hangs unlit over a long dining table.  LAUGHTER.  At 
     the end Nell and the others sprawl over the remains of a dinner 
     which has been going on for hours.  Luke is opening another bottle 
     of jug wine.

                               LUKE
                   You know what I love about wine 
                   that comes in bottles like this?

                               TODD
                   What?

                               LUKE
                   Every year is a good year.

                               MARROW
                   Theo?  It's your turn.

     Theo twirls her wine glass, licks the dregs inside the rim, 
     thinking.

                               THEO
                   The rest of you may hate your 
                   insomnia, but I find it the best 
                   time of the day for me.  I'm 
                   alone.  Nobody's talking to me but 
                   myself.  My mind is racing with 
                   ideas, and I can think.

                               LUKE
                   Nah, you're going crazy with 
                   doubt, all of your mistakes are 
                   coming back up the pipes, and it's 
                   worse than a nightmare. --

     Nell isn't used to people being so direct and at the same time,
     playful.  She glances at Marrow's LEFT HAND: NO WEDDING RING.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Excuse me.

                               LUKE
                   Don't give me that look, it's 
                   everybody's problem, we just have 
                   different variations, I for 
                   example.  I fall asleep easily.  
                   But I wake up around two or three 
                   in the morning, every morning.  
                   It's that time of night that 
                   Fitzgerald called the deep dark 
                   night of the soul.  I stare 
                   into... the abyss.  Every night.
                          (breaks his own 
                           somber mood)
                   It's the price I pay for being 
                   such a jolly fellow.
                          (to Mary)
                   Y usted?

                               MARY
                   I think I'd fall asleep easily, 
                   but just as I start to feel 
                   comfortable, I see things in the 
                   dark.

     Nell hears this, Nell is tuned into Mary.

                               MARY
                   I feel the presence of something 
                   watching me.  It's not... scary... 
                   not by itself but... I don't want 
                   to go to sleep because I'm worried 
                   about the thing attacking me.  So 
                   when I finally do fall asleep, I'm 
                   like a soldier who's fallen asleep 
                   at her post.  I feel like I've 
                   betrayed myself.  Nell?

     Nell wishes she could hide under her plate.

                               NELL
                   All of you have such interesting 
                   problems.

     There's laughter.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No... Please, I know how that 
                   sounds but... You're all so 
                   articulate.  You know how to talk.  
                   I feel like I'm here under false 
                   pretenses.  It's silly, it's not 
                   like... well, all of you have 
                   trouble sleeping because you live 
                   in the world, and the world is 
                   complicated and scary, but 
                   nothing's ever happened to me.  So 
                   I don't have a reason to sleep 
                   badly.

                               MARROW
                   You wrote that you had trouble 
                   sleeping.

                               NELL
                   Yes, because someone was always 
                   keeping me awake.  Ever since I 
                   was little.  That was my job.  I 
                   took care of my mother and I had 
                   to be there for her all night 
                   long, and she woke up all the 
                   time.  And after she died, well, 
                   it's been a few months, but I 
                   still, I still wake up, it's... a 
                   habit.
                          (beat)
                   I know we've only known each other 
                   a couple of hours, but I'm really 
                   glad to be with people who let me 
                   talk about this.  I'm really happy 
                   to be here with you.

     Silence.  The others are embarrassed by her sincerity.  She's right,
     Nell is not of their world.

                               MARROW
                   We're glad you're here.

     He says this with enough sympathy for Theo to see his interest in 
     the girl in the thrift shop dress.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Why don't we move to another room?

     INT. RED PARLOR - NIGHT

     The HARP sings out, lively, expertly played by Mary.  Theo, Luke, 
     Todd and Nell are impressed with her skill.

                               MARY
                   It's an Erard.  Late 1870s.

     She plays, and as she does, she's aware of the room, and the house,
     and she sees something in a curtain or the fireplace, or a window,
     something at the edge of perception.  She suddenly stops.

                               NELL
                   What's wrong?

                               MARY
                   The harp is out of tune.

     She finds a key and begins TIGHTENING the strings -- as Marrow bangs
     open the door, briefcase in one hand, CELL PHONE in the other.  He
     can't conceal his irritation.  Marrow removes folders from his
     briefcase, passes them around while she plays.  Nell again studies 
     the Cherub of Death on the spine of the leather bound books.

                               MARROW
                   I'll have to count David Watts as 
                   a no-show.  So let's start.  Thank 
                   you, Mary.

     That was a little abrupt, she feels it.  Everybody finds a chair or
     spot on the sofa.  Mary remains on the stool by the harp.  Marrow 
     sits in a large winged-back chair.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   All right?  So, to answer your 
                   earlier question, Todd, why are we 
                   here?  What do we all need in 
                   life, what are the basics?  We 
                   need food, we need water, we need 
                   sleep.  Sleep.  All of you resist 
                   it?  Why?  What does that mean?  
                   Why do we resist sleep?  My field 
                   of study is the individual's 
                   psychology of emotion and 
                   performance.

                               LUKE
                   So why did you need the Addam's 
                   Family mansion for a scientific 
                   test?

                               MARROW
                   I thought it best to be isolated, 
                   to be in a location with a 
                   definite sense of history, and I 
                   wanted to make sure that it wasn't 
                   so pleasant you'd all sleep too 
                   easily.  You'll be taking a 
                   variety of tests, none of them 
                   harmful, and you've got the house, 
                   the grounds, and each other to 
                   keep you company.

                               THEO
                   When do we take the tests?

                               MARROW
                   Every day.  Basically we'll be 
                   hanging out together like we have 
                   so far this evening.

     Nell and Theo are looking through their folders: sheets of paper,
     bizarre geometric puzzles.

                               MARROW
                   Also, there is no phone service to 
                   the House and no TV.  I have the 
                   cell phone for emergencies.  We'll 
                   begin the tests after breakfast 
                   tomorrow.  

     The others shuffle through papers, Nell and Todd intent on them, 
     Theo interested but not overly so, Luke, bored.

                               MARY
                   Dr. Marrow, what is this house?

     When she says this, we should be seeing her from an odd perspective,
     the house's POV.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   There was once a king who built a 
                   palace.  The King's name was Hugh 
                   Crain.  A hundred and thirty years 
                   ago, when the Merrimack Valley was 
                   the center of American industry, 
                   Hugh Crain made two hundred 
                   million dollars.  That's forty-
                   three billion dollars in today's 
                   money.  He could have anything he 
                   wanted.  And what he wanted, was 
                   Rene, his banker's beautiful 
                   daughter.  Rene, and a house 
                   filled with children.

                               NELL
                   All the carvings.

                               MARROW
                   But there's a sad catch to the 
                   story.

                               MARY
                   What happened?

                               MARROW
                   There were no children.  Rene 
                   died, and then Hugh Crain built
                   all of this, and then he died.  
                   His heart was broken.

     Nell shifts, looks at the house with a strange feeling.

                               NELL
                   That's so sad.

     This has been tense between them, a gunfight.  POP!  A LOG in the
     fireplace makes everyone jump.  Theo relishes it, but Nell shudders.

                               MARY
                   I think there's more to the story. 
                   This house has its own music, 
                   Doctor Marrow, I can play it for 
                   you, I can hear it.

     Mary plays, channeling unholy music from the house, from the walls,
     from the curtain, from the air.  Her fingers fly down the harp to 
     the THICKEST WIRE and --

     -- TANG!  Like a steel whip the wire SNAPS.

     Mary SCREAMS in pain.

                               MARY
                   My eye... oh... my eye... my 
                   eye... oh... No...

     The others leap up in shock.  Blood lines the wall behind her.  She
     clutches at her eye, more blood spilling out from between her 
     fingers.

                               TODD
                   Oh Jesus.

     Marrow and Theo rush over to her as she shrieks in pain.

     Todd is frozen, pale, like he's about to be sick.  Nell turns the 
     OTHER WAY, but not because she's scared -- she's searching for a 
     shot glass on a side table.

     Marrow wraps Mary in his arms.  Her shrieking becomes a terrified 
     but quieter wail.

                               MARROW
                   Mary, let me see your eye.

     Nell appears by his side with the glass.  Marrow pries Mary's hand 
     from her face.

     Blood flows freely from the eyelid, but her eye is intact.

                               NELL
                   Here, cover it.  Don't let her 
                   touch it.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

     Marrow slams the door on the passenger side of Todd's car.  Mary 
     sits there, moaning, glass covering her eye, blood spilling out 
     around the edges.  Luke is on her side of the car.

                               LUKE
                   Keep your head back, that's it.

     Todd opens his door.  Marrow hands him a key.

                               MARROW
                   Here's my key to the gate.  Call 
                   me the second you know anything.

     Todd takes it, jumps in.  The two men watch the car drive away.

                               LUKE
                   That could have been worse.

                               MARROW
                   Yeah.

     As they turn back, Marrow taps Luke.

                               MARROW
                   Luke, can I talk to you?

                               LUKE
                   Sure.

                               MARROW
                   Because... well, I know I can 
                   trust you.

                               LUKE
                   Why?

                               MARROW
                   I've read your tests.

     That was half a joke, and both men smile.  Now they're bonded.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   There's something... I... I didn't 
                   tell you everyth1ng about the 
                   house, and about Hugh Crain... but 
                   I'm asking you not to repeat it.

                               LUKE
                   I can keep a secret.

     They go in.  The house is outlined by the sky and clouds and the 
     moon.

     INT. MEZZANINE - NIGHT

     Luke catches up with Nell and Theo as he reaches the mezzanine.  The
     painting of Hugh Crain, barely visible in the shadows, looms right
     behind.

                               LUKE
                   He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh 
                   Crain was a monster.  He said that 
                   he was a brutal, horrible man.  He 
                   told me that Crain drove his 
                   workers to early deaths.  Crain 
                   had children chained to the looms 
                   in his mill.  And listen to this: 
                   his beautiful Rene killed herself.

                               THEO
                   And why didn't Marrow tell us?
                   Doesn't he trust women?  That 
                   fuck.

                               NELL
                          (she's thinking 
                           about the story, 
                           not Marrow)
                   A monster?  But he built this for 
                   the woman he loved, like the Taj 
                   Mahal.

                               THEO
                   The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it
                   was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell 
                   us?

                               LUKE
                   He's trying to protect the 
                   experiment.  Personally, I don't 
                   think he's got a large enough 
                   sample for valid results, but as 
                   long as the money's good, and the 
                   food is good, I'm in.

     He heads off.  Theo turns to find Nell staring at the animal heads 
     on the stairs.  Theo touches her.  She starts.

                               THEO
                   Nell, it was an accident.

     INT. MARROW'S BEDROOM (PART OF CONFUSING ROOMS) - NIGHT

     Marrow, sitting at a desk, speaks into a digital voice recorder.  
     His voice is cold, analytical.

                               MARROW
                   Icebreaker exercise conducted over 
                   dinner.  Observed initial bonding 
                   among subjects and experimenter.  
                   After dinner first bland history 
                   of House relayed.  Nell appears 
                   most susceptible to suggestive 
                   history.  Luke, who tested at the 
                   bottom of the Levy-Mogel 
                   Confidence Reliability Scale was 
                   given the second part of the 
                   story.  We should see some results 
                   tomorrow.  Accident with harp, 
                   while unfortunate... complements 
                   the experimental fiction.

     He turns off the machine, and then he says, ruefully:

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Publish or perish.

     He turns off the light.  The shadows in the room are too much for 
     him. He turns the light on, and then pulls the blanket over his 
     head.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell finishes putting things away in drawers.  Theo watches, leaning 
     in the doorway.  Nell looks around at the room: and this is her new
     family's new home.  Theo smiles sweetly at her, comes over.  An 
     awkward moment, as the seriousness drains away.

                               THEO
                   Ever try putting your hair up in a 
                   French twist?

     Theo reaches for Nell's hair.  Nell pulls away.  Theo pauses.  Nell
     realizes she shouldn't have pulled back.

                               NELL
                   Sorry.  I'm not used to being 
                   touched.

     She moves closer to let Theo examine her hair.  Theo takes Nell's 
     hair, holds it up in a French twist.

                               THEO
                   You've been out of the world for a 
                   long time, haven't you?

                               NELL
                   Yes.  I've missed it.

                               THEO
                   No.  The world has missed you.

     Cautiously, Nell peers in a mirror at herself... and likes what she
     sees.  Theo lets Nell's hair drop.  Theo moves for the door.

                               NELL
                   Good night, Theo.

                               THEO
                   You, too.  Happy tossing and 
                   turning.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     As Nell steps OUT OF FRAME and starts undressing, the CAMERA finds 
     the carved mantle, the densely-packed scene of children at play, 
     their faces frozen in dark wooden smiles, their eyes blind but 
     staring OC where we sense Nell changing.

     Now in a long tee-shirt, Nell crawls up onto the high bed.  Its
     headboard is heavy, dark, engraved with fan-like shapes, maybe 
     plants.

     She draws the covers about her and peers up at the ornate headboard.

     Something about it bothers Nell, but she can't put her finger on it.
     She twists over on her side and turns out the light on the 
     nightstand. For a moment, all there is in the darkness is her 
     breathing --

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     -- then almost silence.  We pull back from the CHILDREN'S FACES on 
     the doors of the Great Hall to reveal the vast room standing in 
     darkness.  Covens of strange shapes consort in the shadows, things 
     that in the day would be lamps, the stuff of life.  But now, at the 
     very deepest limit of human hearing, it is as if SOMETHING EXHALES.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     It is black at the top of the stairs.  The carved animal heads on 
     the balusters are all turned UP THE STAIRWAY, eyes starting in fear.
     Waiting for something to walk down out of that blackness.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     Eyes.  Eyes of all the mythological figures.  STARING down the long,
     black hallway.  Awaiting something.  Afraid.

     At the end of the hallway, where all eyes are staring, the double
     doors, the ones that scared Nell and Theo stand shut.

     That something gathering at the edge of our hearing RISES.  Rises as 
     if the House itself is breathing.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     BUMP.  The sound thuds the stillness of the House.  Bump.  Bump.  
     Bump.  Deep, hollow, distant like a dream.  Nell sits up, still 
     asleep, body moving by reflex.

                               NELL
                   Coming, Mother!

     WHUMP.  The noise jars her consciousness, lighting up her mind, VERY
     REAL.  Nell remembers where she is.

     Bump bang.  It's coming from somewhere far off in the House.  Nell
     listens in cold dread.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell!

     Nell spins to the bathroom door, goes through --

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the unlit bathroom, slamming the door to her room behind her,
     across and out the other door --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- into Theo's room.  THUMP BUMP BUMP.  Nell finds Theo right in 
     front of her, hair wet, kneeling in the bed, clutching her covers to
     herself.

                               THEO
                   What is it!?

     The sound grows nearer.  Out in the hall.  Like something searching.
     Coming toward them.

     Nell lunges at the door.  Theo grabs to stop her, and Nell sees the
     door is DEADBOLTED.  There's a RUSHING sound on the other side of 
     the tall door.  Right there.  Nell freezes.  BUMP!  BUMP!

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell!

     Nell recoils to Theo's side, drags Theo out of bed to the corner of
     the room.

     Nell and Theo stare out AT US in terror.  BUMP.  BUMP.  BUMP.  BUMP.

     Nell and Theo's eyes travel over the walls, following whatever it is
     which now seems to be moving out here in the theater.

     The SOUND moves along the wall to the right, reaching its loudest as
     it crosses the back of the theater, then seems to come down the left
     side.

     Theo shivers.  Nell clutches her close.  Nell writhes, unable to 
     stand it any longer.  She jumps up.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell!

     Nell charges the door, screaming:

                               NELL
                   No!

     SILENCE.  The bumping goes dead.  Nell blinks, looks back at Theo.  
     But Theo is looking at her hands.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Cold.  Oh, God.  Feel it.

     She looks up in horror at Nell.  Their breath FOGS in the air.  Nell
     holds her hand up in front of her, and as we watch HER HAIR PRICKLES
     UP, GOOSEBUMPS WITH THEM.

     Her eyes turn up to the door, and: BAMBABAMBAM BABBA BAM!  The DOOR
     JARS in its frame, leaping from the blows of whatever's on the other
     side.

     Nell backpedals but slips on the rug, falls there on the floor right
     in front of the door.  Theo SCREAMS.

     Silence.  The BANGING stops.  With a RUSH, whatever is outside the 
     door is no longer there.

     Nell looks at Theo.

     Then Theo looks at the bathroom.

     Nell starts for it, grabs Theo's door, but it's designed to be 
     locked from the BATHROOM SIDE.  Nell looks up --

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- and takes a step into the pitch-dark bathroom.  Theo appears in 
     the doorway behind her.  Across the bathroom the door to Nell's room 
     is closed.  Nell dashes for it --

     -- but A SUDDEN SCUTTLING SOUND stops her dead.  On the other side 
     of the door.  Rasping over wood.  Like a thing without hands trying 
     to turn --

     -- THE DOORKNOB.  A long beat.  The metal creaks as something takes 
     hold of it on the other side.

     Nell, mouth open in cold horror, sees the deadbolt.  It's open.  
     She's in no-man's land: too far from the door to lock it, too close 
     to run.

     The doorknob TURNS, but just as the door starts to open NELL FLAILS
     FORWARD AND SHOOTS THE DEADBOLT HOME.

     The door jams against it.  Nell jumps back.  Theo grabs her back 
     into --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- her bedroom and slams the door.  A long, deadly silent moment.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   It's in my room.

     But their BREATH no longer fogs.  Theo seems to notice the fact just 
     as Nell starts for her room and... KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.  Behind them.  
     At the door to the hall.

                               LUKE (OC)
                   Hey!  I heard screaming...

                               THEO
                   Luke.

     She grabs for the door and lets Luke in.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell's room stands silent, dark.  The door to the bathroom is shut.  
     The lock slides open.  The door swings in.  Luke stands there, the 
     two women behind him.

     Luke turns on the lights.  The room is perfectly ordinary, no sign 
     that anything has been in here.  The door to the hall is shut.  Nell 
     reacts.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Nell and Theo, wrapped in blankets, sit over mugs of tea at the
     kitchen table.  Marrow, across from them, clicks off his digital
     recorder.  Luke paces behind the women.

                               NELL
                   You really didn't hear anything?

     Marrow takes his glasses off.  Luke looks at him, then goes to the
     kitchen sink.  He turns both faucets on full blast and leans up 
     against the sink, arms folded.  Theo and Nell turn to look at him.  
     A beat.  And then:

     BUMP.  Bump bump.  It's the sound.  Luke goes over to the door, 
     pushes it open.

                               LUKE
                   Oh, look!  There he goes, ol' Hugh 
                   Crain!

     INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     VARIOUS SHOTS as the bumping seems to travel down the hallway.  A
     rushing sound with it.  They're the same sounds, from the scene 
     before, but somehow have none of the impact, none of the presence as 
     they did in Theo's bedroom.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Luke lets the door shut, turns off the faucet.  The sounds of the
     plumbing die away.

                               LUKE
                   Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm 
                   going to bed.  They can stay up 
                   talking another 45 minutes if they 
                   want, but I gotta try to get some 
                   sleep.

                               MARROW
                   Go ahead.

     Luke leaves the kitchen.  Theo and Nell watch him go.

                               THEO
                   If this was some sort of joke, I'm 
                   going to kill him.

                               NELL
                   You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.

     Marrow watches the exchange closely.

                               MARROW
                   The cold sensation.  Who felt it 
                   first?

                               NELL
                   Theo I think.  You've asked us 
                   that three times, Doctor Marrow.  
                   What's going on?

                               MARROW
                   How do you feel about Luke's 
                   suggestion that it was just the 
                   old plumbing?  Water hammer, 
                   something like that?

     Theo and Nell look at each other in frustration.  But Theo tries to 
     get her mind around the question.

                               THEO
                   I did just take a bath.  I don't 
                   know.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     The room is a lot less frightening now, especially with the lights 
     on.  Nell sits on Theo's bed.  Theo looks at the walls, silent, 
     normal.

                               THEO
                   I did just take a bath.

     When Nell doesn't respond for a moment, Theo turns to her, sees her
     wrestling with herself.

                               NELL
                   Mother always banged on the wall 
                   when she needed me.  The night she 
                   died... I heard her, but I 
                   pretended I didn't.  I was just so 
                   sick of it all.  And then the 
                   banging stopped.  And in the 
                   morning... she was dead.  This is 
                   the first I've ever said this to 
                   anyone.  That was the job I had, 
                   Theo, it's the only job I've ever 
                   known, and I failed.  I'm actually 
                   a bad person, Theo.  The world 
                   doesn't need me.

     Theo shakes her head, brushes at her eyes.  The confession, on the 
     top of the fright, has moved her deeply.

                               THEO
                   Oh, Nell.  Eleven years.  With all 
                   due respect to your mother who I'm 
                   sure was a saint, I'd have called 
                   Doctor Kevorkian, if not for her, 
                   for me.

     It's such a horrible thought it makes Nell smile, and they share a
     tearful laugh.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Nell stands in the door to her room.

                               NELL
                   Good night, Theo.

     Nell shuts the door.  Theo is about to close her door, but 
     hesitates.  She puts on the light and goes to the tub.  She turns it 
     on, waits.  Just the sound of the water.  And no bumping.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies asleep under her sheet, the blankets off the end of the 
     bed.  HOVERING OVER HER, on the headboard, the carved faces of 
     children, peering DOWN.

     FLAP.  FLAP flap.  The fan-light at the top of the window right next 
     to the bed is OPEN a crack.  The sheer curtains flap listlessly in a
     gentle breeze.  The flapping grows louder, and with a sudden gust 
     the curtain BILLOWS OUT.  In its flowing form, we sense the SHAPE OF 
     A GIRL'S FACE, fleeting, so insubstantial we know we just saw her, 
     but maybe our eyes are playing tricks on us.

     The CURTAIN blows straight out, touching the bedposts at the foot of
     the bed, and there the wind catches the fabric hanging from them.  
     The Wind seem to sneak under the bedcover and the shape follows...

     Nell sleeps, oblivious, the WIND filling the room, stirring the
     tinkling crystal beads on the candelabra.  The shape of the little
     girl's face now travels underneath the bedsheets toward the pillows,
     toward Nell.

     Nell turns, restless, the AIR catches the edge of the pillowcase, 
     and travels towards Nell's face.  And for a split second there is a
     lifelike IMPRESSION OF A SMALL GIRL'S FACE.  Nell almost awakens.  
     The crystal beads stir, and in their tinkling, in the sigh of wind, 
     we hear:

                               GIRL VOICE
                   Find us, find us Eleanor.

     Nell's eyes open.  And like that, the pillowcase deflates, the air
     rushes up the curtain to the window, and is gone.

     Nell sits up, looks about her.  Everything seems normal.  Just her
     sheets, just the curtains, but on the headboard remain the carved
     faces.  Benevolent.  Nell settles back down on her pillow with a 
     sense of peace.

     INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

     Morning sun filters in through heavy drapes, falling on Marrow at 
     the dining table.  Nell squeezes behind him and the sideboard behind 
     him to get at the coffee.  Nell wears MAKE UP, badly applied, and 
     her HAIR IS UP in a French twist.

                               NELL
                   Sorry.

                               MARROW
                   For an American you do a good 
                   imitation of the British at their 
                   most apologetic.
                          (Veddy British)
                   Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, 
                   sorry...

     Nell smiles.  Theo walks in the door, sees Nell and Marrow, Nell
     squeezed in behind him.

                               NELL
                   Am I that bad?

     Theo is aware of Marrow's curiosity and fascination with Nell.  
     There's a jealousy brewing.

                               THEO
                   Well this is a cozy breakfast.

                               MARROW
                   Good morning, Theo.  Luke.

     Luke comes in behind Theo, tired-looking also.  He goes to the
     sideboard, starts helping himself to breakfast.

                               LUKE
                   After I went to bed, the second 
                   time, after the... noise... I had 
                   the best night's sleep of my life.  
                   Anybody?

     Marrow slept badly, we can see it in his eyes.

                               NELL
                   Yes.  I feel realy rested, too.  
                   Theo?

                               THEO
                   I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks 
                   good.

     But she means exactly the opposite.  Marrow looks over Nell's hair, 
     but she can't stand it.  Luke comes over to the table, drops into a 
     chair next to Nell, digs into breakfast.  Theo's face turns into an
     artificial smile.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Your makeup too.

     Nell sits there flustered.  Marrow senses the jealousy, isn't quite
     sure what to make of it, and intervenes.

                               MARROW
                   Eat your breakfast, Theo, then 
                   we'll get started on the tests.

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     CLOSE ON the complex PUZZLE of a field-cognition test.  Nell 
     scratches solutions, erases, and finally looks up in frustration.  
     She sits alone, tiny, in the murk of the vast vaulted Great Hall.  
     The enormous chimney occupies half the wall on one side of the room.

     Clusters of furniture -- overwrought chairs with animal heads, 
     splay-footed coffee tables, limbed lamps -- huddle in strange, 
     silent covens throughout.  Nell, in a plush chair, lays the work on 
     a table beside her.  The CLATTER of stone on stone makes Nell look 
     up.

     The fireplace looms just beyond her cluster of chairs, large enough
     for a man to stand in.  A piece of mortar must have come loose.  
     Nell stares at the chimney.  And a VOICE lets out a loud groan.

     Nell JUMPS.  She pops out of the chair.  It came from another circle 
     of furniture in the shadows.  A figure stands and comes over.  It's 
     Luke, stretching.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   I've been thinking about these 
                   carvings.  Kids.  Lots of kids.  
                   Fat little angel kids.  Wild kids.  
                   Kids with furry animals.

                               NELL
                   The children.  The children Hugh 
                   Crain built the house for.  The 
                   children he never had.

                               LUKE
                   Come on.  These are the typically 
                   sentimental gestures of a depraved 
                   industrialist.

     He puts his hand on a CHAIR, the back of which is heavily carved in
     the motif he just described.

     Nell turns him an appalled look.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   Theo was working in the dining 
                   room.  She's probably done by now.  
                   You finish?

                               NELL
                   Couldn't get the last ones.  You?

                               LUKE
                   I did okay.

     Nell looks at the test, tries to digest this.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   We could do this stuff anywhere.  
                   I don't know what he's up to yet.  
                   But like I said, that's the fun.  
                   It has something to do with this 
                   environment.

     Luke just smiles, rises.  We'll see.

     He walks off, his footsteps echoing in the vast room.  The door 
     shuts after him.

     Nell sags in her chair.  Then something catches her eye.  On a table
     opposite, a SET OF KEYS.  Nell goes, picks them up.  Car keys, house
     keys.  Must be Luke's.  She pockets them, thoughtful, but just as 
     she does --

     -- something MOVES in the fireplace.  So fleeting Nell can barely 
     see it, and we only catch a frame of it.  But the iron MESH CURTAIN 
     hanging in front of the hearth is STILL SWAYING.

     Nell stands there FROZEN.  The massive fireplace LOOMS before her, 
     like a monstrous mouth, black as pitch beyond the black metal 
     curtains.

     The swaying metal scrapes over brick floor.  Its eerie, repetitive
     screep cutting to the nerve.

     Nell sits paralyzed, rooted to the chair.  SCREEP.  SCREEP.  SCREEP.

     A SINGLE STRAND of NELL'S HAIR stirs toward the fireplace, and --

     -- SOMETHING INSIDE THE FIREPLACE MOVES BEHIND THE MESH!

     Nell CRASHES back over her chair, knocking over a lamp and table,
     tripping, stumbling out of the furniture.

     Holy shit.  Whatever moved in there was real.  Big, dark, like
     something's head.  It goes out of focus and we can't see it as we
     follow --

     -- NELL flying away, across the room in headlong terror.

     INT. FOYER - DAY

     Nell slams out of the room, skidding as the door slams behind her.  
     She sways up off the floor to run --

     -- right into Marrow and Theo's legs.  Nell aborts a scream, 
     realizing who it is.  Theo stands there in surprise, holding papers 
     in her hand.

                               NELL
                   There's someone in there!  There's 
                   someone in there in the fireplace!

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell and Theo stand behind Marrow and Luke across from the 
     fireplace.  Theo glances at Nell.  Nell is shaken.

     Marrow nods to Luke, and they start forward together, Marrow among 
     the furniture to the left, Luke down the right side.

     The iron screens hang silent in the fireplace, black, impenetrable.
     Marrow and Luke come up on either side, Luke ducking this way and 
     that trying to get a glimpse through the mesh.

     They stop before it, neither breathing, both listening.  Marrow 
     steps forward and pulls one screen aside far enough to look in.  
     DARKNESS.

     Nell and Theo watch, apprehensive.

                               NELL
                   Jim...

     Marrow sticks his head into the fireplace.  For a long moment, 
     nothing happens.

     IN THE FIREPLACE: pitch darkness.  Marrow feels up the chimney.

     AND THEN SOMETHING SWINGS DOWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE!  Marrow
     doesn't flinch.

     He FLINGS back the screen, revealing the only things in the 
     fireplace: two massive andirons, and the still-swinging FLUE.  It's 
     cast-iron, forged in the shape of a LION'S HEAD.

     Luke throws back the other screen.  Theo comes over.  Nell follows.
     There's nothing else in the fireplace.

     Luke and Theo stare at Nell.  Marrow squats to study the hearth.  
     The large iron ASH-DROP is coated in soot.

     Not a mark on it.  He opens it.  Inside, a glimpse of ASHES and 
     CHARRED WOOD.  Marrow stands, looks at Nell.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Somebody was in here.  I saw him.

     Marrow looks at her, not sure what to believe.  Nell turns to Luke 
     and Theo for help.  Not from that corner.  Then Nell remembers, 
     reaches into her pocket and produces the KEYS.  She holds them up to 
     Luke.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Are these yours?  I found them 
                   right over there.

                               LUKE
                   Who drives a Toyota?

     Theo shakes her head.  They aren't Marrow's.  Marrow takes the keys 
     from Nell, turns them over.

                               THEO
                   Maybe they're Mary's.

                               MARROW
                   Mary came with me.

                               NELL
                   When I first got here I saw a gray 
                   car pull up.  I thought it was one 
                   of us.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     They stand on the front steps.  Nell's car is right there under the 
     car port.

                               NELL
                   This is my car.

     Theo gestures to a sports car on the circular drive.  Two other cars
     are with it.  They walk out into the driveway.

                               MARROW
                   And those are Luke's and mine.

                               LUKE
                   There's a carriage house around 
                   back.

     EXT. CARRIAGE HOUSE - DAY

     Together they approach a stable/carriage house off to one side of 
     the main House.  It looks old, unused.  They enter through a small 
     door.

     INT. CARRIAGE HOUSE - DAY

     Light filters in through gaps in the wood.  Luke opens one of the 
     main doors with a loud SQUEAK, the sun revealing a TARP-COVERED 
     SHAPE, a carriage.  Unused in a hundred years.  A row of tarp-
     covered carriages fill the stalls into the distance.

                               LUKE
                   Well, this lot is full!

                               THEO
                   He must have left.  Didn't like 
                   the looks of the place or 
                   something.

                               NELL
                   How could he have left without his 
                   keys?

                               THEO
                   Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe 
                   they're not even his.

                               LUKE
                   Then he's got to be in the 
                   house...

     As they leave, the CAMERA LINGERS on a covered shape in one of the
     stalls, SMALLER than the other carriages, it could be a car.  A 
     broken wagon wheel leaning against it.

     INT. STATUARY HALL AND SHORT MONTAGE THROUGH HOUSE - DAY

     Marrow, Theo and Luke move down the hall, opening doors left and 
     right as Nell stands at the center of it all.

                               MARROW
                   Watts!

     No answer.  The statuary peers down on Nell.  Dead faces on busts.  
     Blind marble eyes.

     INT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY

     Luke calls out.

                               LUKE
                   Watts!  Oh Watts!  Here Wattsy...

     INT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY

     Marrow is looking for him, too.

                               MARROW
                   Watts!  Can you hear us?

     INT. VARIOUS ROOMS AND HALLS - DAY

     Nell and Theo, walking into rooms.

                               THEO
                   Watts?

                               NELL
                   What's his first name?

                               THEO
                   David.

                               NELL
                   David?  David Watts?  Can you hear 
                   us?  David!  Daviiiiid!

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY

     Marrow comes through the kitchen.  Mrs. Dudley, chopping carrots,
     stands by the counter.  Only the slightest pause in the rhythm of 
     her chopping says she's noticed him.

                               MARROW
                   Do you know who these keys belong 
                   to?

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   No.

                               MARROW
                   I was expecting another guest 
                   yesterday.  A man, David Watts.  
                   Did you see him?

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                   No.

                               MARROW
                   Is your husband around?  I'd like 
                   to --

                               MRS.  DUDLEY
                   -- Haven't seen him.

                               MARROW
                   Thank you.

     Frustrated, he continues on.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - DAY

     Nell and Theo walk down the long hallway behind, opening doors,
     checking rooms.

                               NELL
                   David?

                               THEO
                   Maybe he never came in.  If he'd 
                   come in, he would have left his 
                   bags at the door, right?  Or maybe 
                   he got here early, and went for a 
                   walk, and fell.  Maybe he's 
                   outside.

     Nell closes a door on the right, and then stops dead.  Staring.

     The shut, dark, door, the one that scared Nell and Theo earlier,
     awaits them at the end.  Ominous.

     Nell approaches.  Closer and closer.  The door nears.

     Nell wraps her arms tightly about herself and try's to open the 
     door.  It's locked.  Her BREATH FOGS THE AIR.  She doesn't notice 
     it.  But then she suddenly GAGS.  With a look of horror she recoils 
     from the door, choking, covering her face.

     Then Theo smells it.  The women are both sick from the smell.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Oh my God, what is it?  Oh, the 
                   smell... ohhh.

     Marrow comes into the hallway.  He sees them from a distance.

     ON the two women.

                               THEO
                          (looks to Nell for 
                           an answer)
                   Is it over?

                               NELL
                   No, it's getting worse.

                               MARROW
                   Nell!  What's wrong?

                               NELL
                   That smell... oh, God.

     Theo blanches, looks at Nell.  She smells it too, and in mirror 
     image fashion backs away from the doors also.  Marrow notices the 
     exchange, and watches them, intense.  And then, in a heartbeat, the 
     moment is over.

     EXT. VERANDA - DAY

     The RED LIGHT on Marrow's DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER blinks.  The device 
     is in Marrow's jacket pocket, CONCEALED from Nell.  They're sitting 
     in Adirondack chairs on the long veranda behind the House.  Marrow, 
     beside her, observes.

                               MARROW
                   What did it smell like?

                               NELL
                   It was very specific.

                               MARROW
                          (so tell me...)
                   All right...

                               NELL
                   In the bathroom in my mother's 
                   room, the toilet was next to an 
                   old wooden table.  It smelled like 
                   that wood.

                               MARROW
                   So... smell... is... Smell is the 
                   sense that triggers the most 
                   powerful memories.  And a memory 
                   can trigger a smell.

                               NELL
                   I wasn't thinking about my 
                   mother's bathroom.

                               MARROW
                   What happened after you smelled 
                   it?

                               NELL
                   I looked at Theo.  She had a look 
                   on her face.

                               MARROW
                   Like she smelled it too?

                               NELL
                   Yes.

                               MARROW
                   And then what happened?

                               NELL
                   I got more scared.

     Marrow thinks about this.

                               MARROW
                   Hmm.

                               NELL
                   I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the 
                   study.

                               MARROW
                   No you're not.  Something moved 
                   you.  You saw something.

     Nell looks to him.  He's sincere.  He believes her.

                               NELL
                   I don't know.  Maybe I...

     "Didn't" she almost says.  She struggles, embarrassed.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I haven't been with people in a 
                   long time.

     Marrow settles in his chair, looks out at the forest.

                               MARROW
                   I really haven't either.

     Nell peers at him, doubtful.  Is she being made fun of?

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   I mean, I'm surrounded by people, 
                   day in, dayout.  Students, 
                   colleagues.
                          (beat)
                   But most of the time, even when 
                   I'm with them... you know... It's 
                   all about power, there's not much 
                   room for actually getting to know 
                   someone or having someone getting 
                   to know you.

     Nell's face flushes with compassion.  With longing.  Marrow looks at
     her.  He's vulnerable.  Needing.  She doesn't dare hope.  The moment 
     lasts a few heartbeats.

     He looks away.  A flicker of distress crosses Nell's face.  And then 
     she realizes Marrow is looking at --

     -- Luke.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   You have to see something.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - DAY

     Luke, Nell and Marrow mount the stairs, climb up and up.  They find
     Theo in the mezzanine staring at the wall at the painting.  She 
     turns and looks at Nell strangely.

     Nell, confused, turns around.  On the wall and the painting are dark
     stains.  Black.  Blue.  Runny.  Almost like something leaking from 
     the roof has run down.

     Nell steps back.  The stains are the letters N and O.  Pulling back
     farther: the rest of the word ELEANOR.

                               NELL
                   My name.

     She follows the streaking substance up, blinking in rising fear as
     more running letters appear.  The word: WELCOME.  And higher up, the
     last: HOME.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No...

     But the substance doesn't come from the ceiling.

     It is as if the oils on the PAINTING OF HUGH CRAIN have been boiled 
     by a heat gun and blasted off, running down from there.  Hugh's face 
     is gone.  In place of the face, the underlying ivory of the canvas 
     glares out... like a skull.

     Nell SCREAMS and runs away, the others calling out after her in 
     alarm.  As they vanish around the corner, the camera tilts down and 
     we discover smeared paint on the floor.  Smeared, it seems, WITH 
     LITTLE FOOTPRINTS in it.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DAY

     Nell, panic rising in her voice, confronts the others.

                               NELL
                   Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome 
                   Home?  I've never been here.  Who 
                   did this?

                               LUKE
                   It's somebody's idea of a joke.

     She looks at all three of them.

                               NELL
                   Who did this?  Why are you doing 
                   this?  I don't know any of you.  
                   You don't know me.  Why are you 
                   doing this to me?

     Luke shakes his head.  Theo starts getting pissed.  Marrow stands 
     there, arms folded, observing.

                               LUKE
                   I didn't do it.

                               THEO
                   You could have.

                               LUKE
                   So could you!  Is this some fucked 
                   up idea of art, putting someone 
                   else's name to a painting?

                               THEO
                   No.

                               NELL
                   Theo... Did you?

                               THEO
                   Maybe you did it yourself.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               THEO
                   I don't know.  You've been alone 
                   for a long time, maybe you want 
                   attention.
                          (pointing to 
                           Marrow)
                   Maybe he did it...

                               MARROW
                   I didn't.  You know that, Nell.

     This is horrifying to Nell, being doubted and accused of something 
     so ugly if it were true.

                               NELL
                   I don't know anything.  Whoever 
                   did this, please, just... just say 
                   so... just... please... this is 
                   cruel.  Don't be cruel to me.  I 
                   can't stand it.  You don't know 
                   me.

     And she runs out.

     Nell grabs for the door to leave.

     She flings open the door.  MONSTROUS arms seem to grab at her.  But 
     it's only a wild-looking coat rack in the hall.

     EXT. 2ND FLOOR BALCONY - DAY

     Nell stands at the railing of a stone balcony on the house's second
     floor.  The air stirs her hair.  She peers up at the House's 
     roofline, its clusters of misplaced windows and other features like 
     so many screaming heads.

     Chilled, she pulls her sweater closer.  Marrow comes out onto the
     balcony from twin French doors behind her.

                               NELL
                   Are you coming to confess?

                               MARROW
                   I wish I were.  I wish I had done 
                   it, then I could confess and you'd 
                   be at peace.  That great moral 
                   philosopher Frank Sinatra once 
                   said to someone he loved, I wish 
                   you had an enemy, so I could beat 
                   him up.

     She smiles.

                               NELL
                   Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did 
                   it?

                               MARROW
                   I don't know.

                               NELL
                   It was a stupid thing to do.

                               MARROW
                   It was.

                               NELL
                          (for the absurdity 
                           of the idea)
                   Welcome Home.

                               MARROW
                   You'll never see it again.  Mr. 
                   Dudley's taking care of it.
                          (beat)
                   I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you 
                   something you'd like to see?

                               NELL
                          (still too shaky 
                           for enthusiasm)
                   Sure.

     INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

     Marrow lets Nell into a long, Victorian-era GREENHOUSE.  It's
     overgrown, lush, the leaded-glass panes above stained with years of
     condensation and pollen.  Vines and trees climb up the sides.  Beds 
     of flowers and plants line narrow footpaths of brick.

     Nell leans down to look into a WATER GARDEN with a STATUE OF A MAN
     bursting from the surface, grasping for the air as if he had been
     drowning.  A sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse.  And A
     CAVALCADE of water comes out of the STATUE'S mouth surprising Nell.
     She lets out a little yelp, and then laughs with Marrow.

     Nell loves the greenhouse.  It takes her breath away.

                               NELL
                   Oh... it's so beautiful...

     Nell makes her way among the plants.  She looks up at a TOWERING,
     DOUBLE-HELIX STAIRCASE which rises from the floor to a platform 
     which gives access to the roof.  Below the staircase are planters 
     filled with violets.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Violets.  Somebody must've died 
                   here.

     And then, out of the corners, comes Mister Dudley.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   That's where she hanged herself.

                               NELL
                   Who?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope.  
                   Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie.  
                   Don't know how she got it.

                               MARROW
                   That's enough, Mister Dudley.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   She stepped off the platform.
                          (he looks up, with 
                           a suggestive leer)
                   They had long skirts in those 
                   days.

                               MARROW
                   Thank you, Mister Dudley, 
                   please...

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   House is full of stories.  If you 
                   know how to read these things, 
                   it's an open book.  Just a 
                   different library than the kind 
                   you're used to.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Why'd she kill herself?

                               NELL
                   Yes.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                          (what other reason 
                           is there?)
                   She was unhappy.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   Can't say.  Haven't been here that 
                   long.
                          (he's off)
                   Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to 
                   work.

     And off he goes.

                               MARROW
                   That's a horrible story.

     Nell looks up, and smiles.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   You're smiling.

     Marrow watches her as she moves about, takes a heavy, ripe bloom in
     hand, lifts it to her face.  While she talks, she walks, and Marrow
     follows.

                               NELL
                   I was just thinking how happy I am 
                   right now.  All my life, I've been 
                   waiting for an adventure.  And I 
                   thought, oh, I'll never have that, 
                   adventures are for people who 
                   travel long distances, that's for 
                   soldiers, that's for the women 
                   that the bullfighters fall in love 
                   with.  And here I am, and 
                   something is happening to me.  
                   Strange noises in the night.  
                   Paintings are calling to me.  And 
                   all it cost to get there was five 
                   gallons of gas.  I'm getting my 
                   adventure.

     For the first time since we've seen Nell, there is something to her
     which is simply... erotic.  Marrow follows her down one of the
     footpaths.  She smiles back at Marrow as he trails her.  She reaches 
     a transept in the greenhouse, and as she turns down it, there's the
     slightest sway to her gait.  Marrow follows her around the corner 
     into the transept.  At the far end the wall is completely overgrown.

     Nell looks up through the ceiling at Hill House looming grim 
     outside, distorted in the old glass.

                               MARROW
                   Someone is playing with you.

                               NELL
                   Why?

                               MARROW
                   I don't know.

                               NELL
                   It doesn't matter.  Even if 
                   they're tormenting me, someone 
                   wants me.  What I do with this is 
                   up to me.  I can be a victim, or I 
                   can be a volunteer.  And I want to 
                   be the volunteer.

     Nell glances at him, and for that split second she is raw, 
     passionate woman.  She walks away, the sway in her gait aching, 
     powerful.  Marrow is surprised by what Nell just said and stares at 
     her as she comes to the overgrown end.  Nell reaches out to the 
     hanging vines, pulls them aside...

     ...and A FACE stares out.  Gastly.  White.  Nell takes an 
     involuntary step back, a little gasp.

     The face is marble.  Blind eyes stare from stained cheeks.  It is a
     STATUE OF CRAIN.  Marrow comes over.

     It's an enormous stone tableaux of Hugh surrounded by cherubim.  The
     plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence
     from the greenhouse.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Hugh Crain.  Can't seem to get 
                   away from him.

     She laughs a little at herself.  Marrow joins in.  He helps her pull 
     the plants back to reveal more of it.

     She reaches out, touches the marble cheek.  Then daring, grins, and
     begins to hum her TUNE.

     Marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow-dance with Hugh
     Crain, pirouetting, her hips sliding past... hypnotizing Marrow.

                               MARROW
                   What is that tune?

                               NELL
                   I don't know.  A lullaby I guess.  
                   My mother used to hum it to me.  
                   And her mother before that, and so 
                   on.
                          (to the statue)
                   Hugh Crain, would you care to 
                   dance?

     She hums another two notes, and BANG!  The door behind her SLAMS 
     OPEN in a gust of wind, jolting Nell.  She stops and stares.  
     Outside the window, through the glass, she sees Mr. Dudley, staring 
     at her, he's been watching her dance.  The spell is broken.  Nell, 
     embarrassed, can't bear to look at him.

     A beat, and then Marrow goes over and shuts the door.  When he turns
     back --

     -- Nell is just vanishing around the corner, her rapid footsteps
     echoing in the vaulted room.

     EXT. REAR LAWN - DAY

     Nell hurries away from the House, across the rear lawn, ashamed at
     herself as much as she is spooked.

     In the distance Mr. Dudley is walking toward the House with cans of
     paint cleaner an a ladder.  Nell stops, watching him.  He senses 
     her, pauses, and smiles.

     Nell reacts.  Sees the ladder.  Then Mr. Dudley disappears into the
     House.

     Nell once again starts to hurry away, but looking back over her
     shoulder, almost impales herself on the rusted iron fence of --

     EXT. FAMILY CEMETERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the tiny Crain family cemetery.  Nell catches herself.  A small
     swinging gate bars the way.  She hesitates.

     Nine moss-covered headstones show the wear of a long century.  Eight
     small headstones, one large one.  A half dozen unmarked stones in 
     the grass: stillbirths.

     Nell is drawn into the graveyard.  The large stone is RENE CRAIN'S.  
     The smaller ones are her children's.

     Nell's heart is breaking as she moves among them: the various names.
     One reads ADAM CRAIN APRIL 5th 1874 -- ... The rest of the date is
     covered by growth.  She clears it away.  April 6th, 1874.

                               NELL
                   Only two days.

     There is an EPITAPH, almost wiped out by lichens.  Nell kneels to 
     read it.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   The blest are the dead / Who see 
                   not the sight / Of their own 
                   desolation...

     Nell, disturbed but not knowing what to make of it, rises from the
     gravestone, turns to the next.  ELISA CRAIN AUGUST 21ST, 1878 -- She
     clears it away: August 21, 1878.  The blasphemous epitaph here:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   A father's joy unjustly snatch'd 
                   by a jealous God...

     Nell is shaken, and dreading what she will find next, whirls to the
     one behind her: WENDY CRAIN JANUARY 1 , 1880 -- She clears it away 
     -- January 1, 1880.  And its graven commandment, so familiar, so
     comforting, now rings with terrible, malevolent promise:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Suffer the little children unto 
                   me.

     There are three more grave stones, and after clearing away the 
     brush, they too show that the babies died after a few hours, or a 
     day.  There's the same symbol on the graves of the children, a 
     cherub of death.  We've seen this image before.  Nell backs out of 
     the cemetery, afraid.

     INT. MEZZANINE - DAY

     Nell hurries down the mezzanine to the doorway which leads to the 
     Red Parlor.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DAY

     She stands there a beat staring in at the volumes upon volumes of
     books.  Nell is unsure of what she's looking for.  She looks at 
     Crain's painting and recognizes the same Cherubs inside the ornate 
     frame.  The background in the painting IS THE RED PARLOR.  Then 
     recognizes in the painting an OPEN BOOKCASE BEHIND CRAIN.  
     Intuitively, she turns toward the same bookcase across from her and 
     is able to push it open.  Inside a small stairwell...

     INT. CRAIN'S SECRET STUDY - DAY

     Down the circular stairs Nell enters a very small dusty room.  
     Velvet curtains drawn shut, only a sliver of sunlight showing 
     through.  As her eyes adjust, she makes out the furnishings of a 
     late-nineteenth century office, Crain's secret office.

     The bookcases filled with business ledgers.  The business ledgers 
     are stamped with the cherub of death.

     At the end is an enormous desk.  Behind it a massive, carved chair
     covered with a sheet, only its lion-head arm rests protruding from
     underneath.  Nell realizes it's:

                               NELL
                   Crain's study.

     She moves for the desk.  An ENORMOUS MIRROR, its silver inner 
     surface flaking with age, tarnished, reflects the room, the desk, 
     and FOR A SPLIT SECOND, A SHADOW IN THE CHAIR.  Nell steps in front 
     of it, blocking our view.

     And when she steps past, there is only the dim, flaking image of the
     chair, the natural shadow of the room.

     Nell goes around the desk, stands over it.  The chair sits silent
     behind her, shrouded.

     On the desk sits a set of ledgers marked with mill names -- Lowell,
     Haverhill, Manchester -- and years: 1884, '85 and so on.  She flips 
     one open.

     THE LEDGER is a payroll account.  Names upon names of workers 
     rendered in sepia by Crain's severe cursive.  Notations in the 
     column beside it indicate man, woman, or child and the appropriate 
     wage for each class of worker.  Many of them, at least a third, are 
     children.

     NELL reacts.  Disturbed by it.  She shifts closer to that damn chair
     behind her.  The sheet hangs over it in such a way that someone 
     could be sitting there under it.

     She turns the page.  Columns indicate pay, and so on.  But one 
     column, at the very center of the book, hidden in the binding, is 
     unlabeled. Down the column, some names have a line drawn through 
     them, and at the end of the line, a CROSS.

     Nell follows them back, eyes searching across the ledger.

     She turns the page, pushes the book down revealing that concealed
     column, more crosses.  And more.  Her eyes flick back and forth.  
     The crosses are paired with entries for CHILD.  She looks their 
     names...

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Erin, Peter and Sean and Emily and 
                   Elizabeth... who are you?  And 
                   you?  What happened to you?  You 
                   died... How did you die?

     Nell turns the pages.  More and more crosses.  Dozens.  Scores.

     Nell sinks down into Crain's chair and tears come to her eyes.  We 
     see the book.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     The painting is right there now.  The letters have been erased.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     We see the ledger, and pull back, and the ledger is in Nell's lap.
     Nell sits on the bed in her sleeping tee-shirt and undies.  Theo 
     looks at the book with her.

                               THEO
                   That's so sad.

                               NELL
                   There's hundreds of them.  This 
                   must be a record of the children 
                   who died at the mills, like Luke 
                   said.

                               THEO
                   Before he painted your name over 
                   Mister Crain.

     Theo hands her the bottle.  Nell takes it, tops off her glass,
     spilling.  Her face is red.  She grimaces as she tosses back a big
     swallow.

                               NELL
                   You really think it was Luke?

     Theo takes another swig.  She holds bottles of nail polish up next 
     to Nell's bare feet, testing the colors.

                               THEO
                   Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley 
                   had to clean it and he knows that 
                   he's in charge of all the messes 
                   so why would he make more work for 
                   himself and...
                          (beat)
                   You said the Good Doctor was with 
                   you.

                               NELL
                          (pondering)
                   I don't know what to think 
                   anymore.

                               THEO
                   Just think about one thing right 
                   now: What color?

     Nell finally puts the book down and takes a drink.

                               NELL
                   I've never had a pedicure before.

                               THEO
                   Well?

                               NELL
                   Red.
                          (into this now)
                   What else?

     Theo smiles and takes Nell's foot gently in her hand.  She begins to
     paint her toenails.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   See, isn't this better than a hit 
                   on the head?

     Nell looks down her long legs at Theo.

                               NELL
                   I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.

                               THEO
                   Me too.  Although I learned one 
                   thing about you, that you don't 
                   know about yourself.  You can be a 
                   pretty decent bitch.

     Nell shoots down the rest of the glass of wine.

                               NELL
                   I'll take that as a compliment.
                          (beat, trying to 
                           sound casual)
                   In the city, what kind of place do 
                   you live in?

                               THEO
                   I have a loft.

     Nell is thrilled with this.

                               NELL
                   A loft.  That's a lot of room for 
                   one person.  Probably.  Maybe 
                   there's room for...

     Theo looks up, understands what she's asking.

                               THEO
                   You want to move to New York, you 
                   want to move in with me?

                               NELL
                   I don't know, you know...

     Nell lies back, arms spread, lets the glass roll out of her hand.  
     Theo paints Nell's toenails one by one, carefully guiding the brush 
     strokes in along the skin.  Nell, unused to this, gives into the 
     pleasure, and Theo sees how easy it is to move Nell.

                               THEO
                   My place isn't like yours, Nell, 
                   it doesn't have a view of sea.  It 
                   doesn't have a view of anything.  
                   What's interesting about the way I 
                   live is what goes on inside the 
                   walls.  Living with me... My 
                   boundaries aren't very well 
                   defined, Nell.  Do you know what I 
                   mean?

                               NELL
                   I'm trying.  Have you ever kept 
                   something to yourself because you 
                   were afraid it'd ruin things.

     Theo looks up at her, unreadable.

                               THEO
                   All the time.

     Nell lets out a sigh.  Gently Theo's hand moves down the arch of 
     Nell's foot.  Caressing.  Nell lets her.

     Theo finishes Nell's last little toe, and then with the brush out of
     paint, runs it gently up the inside of Nell's calf.  Nell sighs.

     Theo lowers her face near Nell's toes, licks her lips: soft, near,
     red.  She blows.

     Nell raises herself up, peers down at Theo.  Sees the want on her 
     face.  A long beat.

     Nell breaks the gaze, looks away.  Theo reads Nell's look, and 
     releases her foot.  She sits back in the chair.  For a moment Nell 
     doesn't know what to do.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I better go to bed.

                               THEO
                   Are you sure?

                               NELL
                   I think so.

                               THEO
                   Okay.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell closes the door and sits at the vanity brushing out her hair 
     for bed.  Her motions are languid in the light of the single small 
     lamp, off-balance with the wine.

     Her HAIR brushes out in long, even strokes.  The brush moves through
     it, lifting it and letting it fall.

     IN THE MIRROR the brush draws through Nell's hair, but as it does, 
     the hair divides in its wake LIKE FINGERS RUNNING THROUGH it.

     Nell freezes.  She's not sure what she just saw.  She runs the brush
     through again, and again it is as if something pulls it back from 
     her head.

     Again -- fast -- she runs the brush through her hair, and this time
     the hair SPINS UP IN A KNOT.

     Nell flinches, dropping the brush, knocking the shade of the lamp on
     the vanity a-wobbling.

     She's out of the chair in a flash, grabbing her own hair, staring at
     the space behind her.  Nothing there.  A beat.

     She steadies herself, feeling the alcohol.  Gets control.

     The Tiffany lamp rocks back and forth, crystal beads shimmering.  
     The light plays across the fireplace and mantle on the wall.  And 
     something there catches her eye.

     Nell feels her way across the room, not sure of what she's seeing.
     Over the sound of the wind outside, there's something at the very
     highest edge of hearing.

     She stops five feet from the mantle.  The swaying light catches the
     rich tones of wood.  Then darkens.  Illuminates it again.  Darkens.  
     The carvings of the playing CHILDREN in the wood SEEM TO MOVE.

     Nell stares in drunken fascination.  And as the first fear begins to
     rise in her throat, the wind dies down and in its place there is the
     FAINTEST TRACE OF CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER.  Nell's reaction changes... 
     to awe.

     Tentative, her hand goes out, shaking... and touches the mantle.

     It is hard and still.  No movement whatsoever.  Silence.  But the 
     FACES engraved in the wood all seem to be peering up at her, hands
     outstretched for her, hopeful.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE GATES - NIGHT

     The enormous LOCKED gates are silhouetted against the moonlit sky.  
     The chain is dangling in the wind.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - NIGHT

     Hold on Nell's WINDOW, the light shining dim through the gauze
     curtain.  It goes out.  The window stares from an arrangement of 
     other windows, stonework and doors... like an eye with a cataract in 
     a face howling in horror.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell, her breathing heavy, lies tangled in her heavy blankets, 
     asleep, but restless.  Her feet hang off the end of the bed.

     In the b.g., the door to the bathroom is shut, barely visible in the
     faint light from the window.  HOLD on it.

     Silently, it begins to OPEN.  The gap WIDENS, yawning, pitch dark
     beyond.  A long beat.  And then a THUMP.  A SLIDING SOUND.  
     Something drags itself across the floor.

     BUMP.  SLIDE.  Our line of sight is blocked by the bed.  But the 
     sound is getting louder, coming closer.

     Bump.  Slide.  Nell grinds her teeth in her sleep, pulls the 
     blankets about her tighter.  Bump.  The sound stops.  And her BREATH 
     BEGINS TO FOG.

     Whatever has just come in the room is right there, hovering just OC.
     We can feel it.

     Without warning Nell BOLTS upright, GASPING into consciousness.
     REVEAL: nothing.  Just the dark room.  And the bathroom door OPEN.

     Nell stares at the-door, knows she shut it.  Now it's open.  She 
     breaths fast, feeling the cold, knowing something's in here with 
     her.

     She stops breathing, strains her ears.  Silence.  A long moment.  
     Then she notices her feet, hanging out from under the covers.

     They are black.  Feel slick.  Nell turns on the light by her bed and
     looks down.

     HER FEET ARE COVERED IN GORE.  Where Theo had been painting.  Nell
     SCREAMS.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     SCREAMING, Nell spins the tub faucets on full blast, sticks her feet
     into the spray.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell?  Nell!

     Weeping, Nell scrubs the gore off her feet -- red, black like old
     clotted blood.

                               NELL
                   Who is doing this to me?

     The door to Theo's bedroom is shut.  The handle rattles, urgent, but 
     it won't open.  It's LOCKED.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell, what's wrong?  What's wrong?

     The blood or whatever it is on Nell's feet comes off, is sucked down
     the drain.

                               THEO (OC) (cont'd)
                   Nell, it's locked, let me in!

     Nell, squatting in the tub, sobs as her feet come clean, and there 
     are NO WOUNDS.  Theo rattles the door.

                               THEO (OC)
                   Nell, the door is locked.  Open 
                   it.

     Nell rises, steps out of the tub, and looking like she could kill,
     moves for Theo's door.

     She grabs the handle but realizes what Theo has been trying to tell
     her all along: it's LOCKED.  Perplexed, Nell finds the key in the 
     hole, and turns it.

     The door rams open, Theo behind it, terrified and clearly just 
     awoken.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell...

     Nell stares at her, hair tangled, tear-stained, doubtful.  Water
     splashes in the tub, faucets still running.

     The LIGHTS flicker as one in the connecting rooms.  Theo has time to
     look up at the bulb in the bathroom, and they all GO OUT.  Darkness
     swallows them up.  Stray moonlight reflecting in the mirror 
     silhouettes them standing there.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   Nell, the tub!

     Nell stoops in the darkness and the faucets squeak shut.  Theo bumps
     her way out of the room.  Nell moves to the doorway following her
     into --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     -- Theo's room.  Theo's form moves by her bed, and with a snick, her
     cigarette lighter lights up.  Theo holds it above her head, its tiny
     orange flame glistening off polished wood in the shadows.  Nell 
     steps toward her.

     Drip.  Drip.  From the bathroom.  Theo's eyes widen?

                               THEO
                   Oh, God, your breath...

     And sweeping over them a SHOCK OF COLD.  Their breath.

     Nell shakes her head: don't say anything.  Nell turns around, the
     darkness almost impenetrable.  SHAPES, alien, threatening, at the 
     very edge of light -- anyone could be some... thing.  Drip.  Drip.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   It's here.

     Nell looks down at Theo's bed, then at Theo who moves closer to 
     Nell.  Nell gives the bed a wide berth.  Together they back toward 
     the wall with the fireplace.

     They stare out at us, eyes trying to adjust, afraid.  Behind them 
     looms the fireplace and in front of it, a metal cage-like fire 
     screen.  A beat.

     BAM!  SOMETHING LUNGES out of the fireplace but is caught in the
     screen, hitting Nell and Theo in the back.

     Theo's lighter goes flying in that very instant, and we never see
     what's hit the screen.  Neither do they.  Theo falls SCREAMING.  
     Nell manages to whirl, embrace the cage and slam it with whatever's 
     inside back into the fireplace.  The screen JOLTS hard enough to 
     lift Nell.

                               NELL
                   HELP!

     Theo still SCREAMING, lying on her back before the fireplace, rams 
     her feet against it.  The screen HAMMERS at Nell and Theo.  They 
     can't run or it'll get out.

     Theo's screaming is suddenly drowned out by a HORRIFYING, INHUMAN
     SOUND from inside the fireplace.

     Theo's scream goes dead in breath-stealing horror.  Nell recovers.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No!  Go AWAY!

     The screen punches out at them, denting.  And then all the air in 
     the room seems to be SUCKED into the fireplace in one THUMP.  The 
     door to the bathroom slams.

     It's gone.  They sit there in the darkness, panting.

     INT. GREENHOUSE - NEXT DAY

     Nell stares at the tableaux of Hugh Crain.  In the morning light it
     seems inert, cold, just a statue.  Luke and Theo enter.  Nell 
     doesn't seem to notice them until they're beside her.

                               THEO
                   Marrow said the same thing as last 
                   night, he says --
                          (meaning, this is
                           on his now
                           doubtful word)
                   -- that he checked with Mrs. 
                   Dudley.  And he says that she told 
                   him that all the fireplaces in the 
                   West Wing connect to the main 
                   chimney.  He says that he thinks 
                   that the flue was open, and with 
                   the windstorm, he says that what 
                   probably happened was some kind of 
                   freak air current --

                               NELL
                   -- What do you think?

     Theo considers, then looks at her, severe.

                               LUKE
                          (lowers his voice)
                   Don't tell the Professor; he'd 
                   probably throw me out.  But test 
                   taking is one of the ways I've 
                   been supporting myself.  I 
                   volunteer for every paid study 
                   that they offer.  Of course 
                   straight psych stuff doesn't pay 
                   as much as the pharmaceuticals do, 
                   or a good wound study.  Check it 
                   out.

     He rolls up his sleeve revealing large, livid SCARS at intervals too
     regular to be anything natural.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   A thousand dollars each.  Am I 
                   sick?  Yes.  Do you know why I 
                   only date freshmen?  By the time 
                   they're sophomores, they've 
                   figured me out.

                               THEO
                          (get back on track!)
                   Mister very talky, would you 
                   please say what it is about this 
                   study that bothers you?

                               LUKE
                   The whole thing feels like 
                   experimental misdirection.  Like 
                   he says it's about one thing, a 
                   psychological profile of 
                   environmental effects on 
                   insomnia... and that'd be a 
                   legitimate study, but I think that 
                   we've been subjected to an 
                   academic bait and switch; he's 
                   really looking at something else.

                               NELL
                   No.  No... Jim's not doing -- 
                   these things.

     But there's a desperate, rising edge to Nell's voice.  Theo's, in
     response, is quiet, sober... certain.

                               THEO
                   Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep 
                   down, if you really thought it 
                   wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be 
                   leaving right this second?  Why 
                   wouldn't you be afraid?  Really 
                   afraid.

                               NELL
                   Because I don't want to ruin 
                   things.  Because home is where the 
                   heart is.

     Theo is chilled by this answer which would only make sense to 
     someone out of her mind.

     Nell looks up and sees the double staircase at the end of the
     greenhouse... the one where Crain's wife killed herself.

     And for a moment we see Crain's wife hanging there and then the 
     image is gone...

     INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

     Lunch remains are on the table as Nell enters, test papers in hand.

                               NELL
                   Jim?  I'm done.

     But Marrow isn't there.  She's about to go back out to look for him,
     but sees something and stops.

     Forgotten by a reading chair to one side of the room.  Barely 
     visible.  Marrow's BRIEFCASE.  Nell goes to the briefcase, knowing 
     she shouldn't look, and unable to help herself.  Marrow's digital 
     recorder glints out at her.

     Nell takes it out, and presses play.  She looks up at the door.  Any
     minute he could come back in here... and then Marrow's voice rings 
     out.

                               MARROW (V.O.)
                   ...the hallway discussion about 
                   last night's fireplace incident 
                   concluded at three a.m.  Nell 
                   continues her alienation of the 
                   other subjects and the 
                   experimenter.  It remains unclear 
                   whether she truly believes she did 
                   not deface the painting.  
                   Interview with the subject in 
                   greenhouse yesterday to ascertain 
                   the extent of her self-delusion 
                   was inconclusive due to her 
                   efforts to sexualize encounter 
                   with experimenter.

     Marrow's voice continues on in his assessment, but Nell isn't 
     hearing anything anymore.

     She dies inside.  Her world upside down.  She falls into a chair, 
     and all we can hear of Marrow is the cold, analytical tone, his 
     garbled jargon.

                               MARROW (OC)
                   One minute!

     It's Marrow, for real, about to enter.  Nell clicks off the 
     recorder, drops it into the briefcase.  Marrow is startled, not 
     expecting Nell to be sitting right next to his papers and briefcase.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Nell.

     She can only stare at him, eyes dead.  Marrow looks from her to the
     briefcase and back.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Were you looking for me?

     Nell can't answer.  Marrow comes over, unsettled.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   How are the tests going?

     Nell rises, staring, emotionless.  Betrayal just beginning to find a
     hold.  She hands him her papers.  Marrow looks at Nell, knows she's 
     been in his briefcase.  He picks it up, and with a final, sorry 
     glance, exits.

     INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

     Nell emerges from the study, stands there a beat, lost.  Then she
     turns, resolute, and starts moving.  Faster.

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell, blinded by tears, runs across the room toward the grand entry
     and the exit... and stops.

     DOWN THE CONNECTING HALL, out in the grand entry, at the front 
     doors, are Mr. and Mrs. Dudley.  Leaving for the day.  They stop.  
     Look at her.

     Nell, numb, gazes from the open door to Mrs. Dudley.  Mr. Dudley 
     holds the door open as if in invitation.  Nell could walk out right 
     now.  This is her chance.  But...

     Mrs. Dudley smiles a knowing smile.  An all too knowing smile.  And
     seeing Nell's decision, gently shuts the door.  The LOCK CLICKS.  
     Final.  Fate-sealing.

     Nell turns back to the House, lost.

     INT. RED PARLOR - DAY

     Nell walks right up to the moveable bookcase and enters Crain's 
     secret study.

     INT. CRAIN'S SECRET STUDY - DAY

     Nell sits in silence, trying to find a feeling, any feeling.  A long
     beat.  And without warning she leaps to her feet in SHOCKING rage.

                               NELL
                   How can he think I'm doing this!

     She has a floor lamp in her hands, and hurls it like a throwing 
     hammer at the nearest shelves.  Vases, knickknacks and a LEATHER 
     ALBUM crash to the floor.

     She stalks around the room, and then slows, staring at what she's
     done, the rage draining out of her.  But if she could do something 
     like that...

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No.  No, I couldn't do those 
                   things: I'm not making it up.

     She turns in place, desperate... and sees the old leather album
     precariously tilting on one of the sprung shelves.  It's open.  One 
     of the leaves flips over on its own, gravity and the weight of its 
     own pages TURNING IT.

     Nell approaches, stepping over broken ceramic.  SLIP.  Another page
     turns.

     Nell hovers over it, holding her breath so as not to make the book
     flip over and fall off the shelf in one instant.

     SLIP.  Another page turns.  The book is a PHOTO ALBUM of the late
     nineteenth century, bound with ribbons, the aged Daguerreotypes in
     pressed vellum frames.

     Nell peers closer.  It's open to a faded, gray image taken long 
     before it became the convention to smile for a photograph: a woman, 
     RENE CRAIN, sitting in a chair.

     And standing behind the chair, a fearsome presence in a black coat,
     his face hollow, malevolent.  HUGH CRAIN.

     Nell shivers, and SLIP, the page turns on its own.

     An image of Hugh and Rene, a look of deathly loss on their faces.  
     The page flips.

     Crain hovers, dark, rage just under the surface, but on Rene's face 
     is the faintest, most inappropriate SMILE.  It sends a chill through 
     Nell.

     The album begins to slide down the shelf, and as it does, PAGES 
     FLIP, Rene's SMILE grows wider, her hair dishevelled, her eyes lit 
     with grinning insanity...

     Nell grabs the book just as it falls from the shelf.

     It is open in her hands to a picture of Crain, alone, in front of 
     the enormous fireplace in the Great Hall.  RENE IS GONE.  The photo 
     is monstrous.  Nell, fearful, turns the page --

     -- and REACTS to the last thing she expected.  A picture of a lovely
     woman filled with grace and power.  CAROLYN CRAIN.  Posed.  On a 
     settee before the fireplace.  Beautiful beyond words.  Smiling.  
     Ahead of her time.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   His second wife.  There was a 
                   second wife?  Carolyn.

     It warms Nell.

     She turns the page.  Now Crain is there beside Carolyn.  But there 
     is something different about him.  Less frightening.

     Nell flips the page again, and now there is an image of Crain and
     Carolyn.  Her hair is up in a FRENCH TWIST.  Nell smiles more.

     Nell turns the page yet again.

     But something is wrong.  It is another image of Carolyn and the
     kinder, gentler Crain, but now it is Carolyn who is unsmiling.

     Another page.  Another.  Carolyn's face darkening.  And in this 
     picture, Carolyn's stomach is slightly distended.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   She was pregnant.

     Nell TURNS PAGES FASTER AND FASTER, and as she does, Carolyn SWELLS
     PREGNANT before our eyes in ragged animation, mouth working as if to
     speak, voiceless as it is... ELEANOR.

     Nell fumbles the book onto the floor.  It stares up at her, open to 
     the last page.

     It is an image of Carolyn.  Betrayal.  Hell.  Knowledge.  Her hand 
     seems to be POINTING at the gaping maw of the GRAND FIREPLACE.

     Nell bolts from the room.

     INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

     Nell bursts into the Great Hall and stops.  At the far end of the 
     room broods the vast fireplace, its chain curtains hanging like the 
     veil to some hellish sanctuary.

     Nell stares at it, daunted.  What is it that Carolyn is trying to 
     show her?  The fireplace beckons, and Nell approaches against her 
     will.

     She finds a steel poker hanging by the fireplace, and takes it down.
     She uses it to slide one of the chain curtains open.  She steps into
     its soot-black mouth.

     Nell peers up the chimney.  A faint sigh of air.  She sticks the 
     poker up the flue, scratches around.  Nothing.

     She turns her attention to the back of the fireplace, thwocks it.
     Sooty stone chips away, but it's solid.

     The mechanism for the ash drop catches her eye.  Nell grabs the 
     heavy, iron lever.  She pulls, but can barely budge it.  It finally 
     screeches back, and the iron door in the floor of the fireplace 
     SWINGS DOWN.

     Nell looks in.  Two feet down it looks like a gray blanket of ash, a
     charred timber or two sticking out.  Sick with fear, Nell prods the
     ash.  Just charred wood.

     She thrusts the poker down deep.  It vanishes in the ash up to her
     hand.  CLACK.  She rakes through the ash.  CLACK.  And then she 
     feels the poker take purchase.  She draws it out, and full of dread 
     turns it to the light...

     Impaled on its hooks are TWO HUMAN SKULLS.

     Nell fights back the scream in her throat.  One of the skulls is a
     child's skull, the other an IMMENSE SKULL with brooding brow, 
     forehead crushed.

     Nell lets the poker drop.  It bangs off the door, falls in the ash
     drop, its handle hitting a spring.  Nell recoils as the trapdoors 
     SNAP SHUT like a pair of jaws.

     INT. GROUND HALLWAY FLOOR - DUSK

     Nell stumbles down the hall, weeping in fear.

                               NELL
                   Theo!  Jim!  Help!

     But instead she hears children voices, calling out for her.

     INT. CONFUSING SERIES OF ROOMS (THE MAZE) - NIGHT

     Nell winds through the pitch-dark halls, rooms gaping black left and
     right, searching for the voices which seems to come from just around
     the next bend, leading her around corner after corner.

     The hallways peel past Nell as she runs, slamming through doors, 
     ever darker.  The House's hellish carvings glare as she passes, 
     grinning, taunting.  She rages on, oblivious until she rounds a 
     final corner --

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     -- into the long, dark hall leading to the LOCKED ROOM.  The 
     STATUARY peer down on her.  Dead faces.  Blind marble eyes.  As she 
     turns, the heads and eyes turn imperceptibly with her.

     For a frame or two the EYES are real, just a subliminal glimmer.  
     For the instant we try to catch the movement, the illusion, it isn't
     there.  It makes Nell stop.  She regards the terrible doors.  She
     considers the labyrinth around her.  And begins to understand.

                               NELL
                   The house... it's a maze, that's 
                   how you designed it, didn't you, 
                   Mister Crain?  So wherever one of 
                   your little guests went, the house 
                   brought them here.  It's designed 
                   to make you come here.  But why?

     Another CRY comes from the far end.

     Nell eases down the hallway, the fear welling back on her like a 
     tide.  She hesitates, but then the CHILD-CRY forces her on.  She 
     reaches the CARVED DOORS with the wooden guard statues.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Oh, no... Oh... no... no, no... 
                   not that... Oh no... Ohhhhhhhhh!

     Gaping cold and stench hit her.  She gags.

     Now the CRY comes from under the door.  Present.  Real.  Right 
     there.  Nell shudders.

     The CRY grows louder, desperate.  She shuts her ears to it.  The CRY
     rises to fearsome rage, not sounding like a child anymore.  Not
     sounding like anything human at all, it's painful.  Nell looks at 
     the locked room in horror and takes off running.

     INT. PICTURE GALLERY - DUSK

     Nell bursts into the picture gallery and stops.  Standing there are
     Marrow, Theo and Luke, stricken silent by her entry.  Looks of shock 
     on their faces.  Nell just stands there.  A beat.  And then it pours 
     out of her, hysterical.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   He hunted all those children in 
                   here.  The dead children, Josiah 
                   and Elizabeth and all of them... 
                   from the books... he took them up 
                   here... he played games... the 
                   ones from his mills he burned them 
                   up in the fireplace but she found 
                   out what he did and she killed
                   him --

     She takes a breath, and turns gray.  Before anyone else can react, 
     her legs go out from under her, and she lands sitting.  Theo and 
     Marrow get to her side fast.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   -- he didn't kill her she killed 
                   him and ran away with her baby --

     Marrow grabs her face.  It's gray, her eyes glazing over.

                               MARROW
                   Get a blanket!

                               THEO
                   It's okay... we're all here...

     Luke races out.  Theo, scared, looks at Marrow.

                               THEO (cont'd)
                   What's happening to her?

                               MARROW
                   She's in shock.  Come on.

     He starts to lift her.  Theo takes her other side.

                               NELL
                   After Rene... after she killed 
                   herself... he turned into a 
                   monster.  He did fill the house 
                   with children... he did, but... 
                   they weren't laughing...

     Nell is ugly, sprawling, in shock, as Theo and Marrow shuffle her to 
     a padded bench on one side of the room.

                               THEO
                   Nell, what happened?

                               NELL
                   Carolyn showed me where she hid 
                   him, hid him with all the ones he 
                   killed --

                               MARROW
                   Nell... please, Nell... take a 
                   deep breath...

                               NELL
                   And they're all locked together in 
                   here... and he won't let go of 
                   them!

     Marrow grabs her face.

                               MARROW
                   Nell!

     Luke rushes in with a blanket.  Theo covers Nell and then holds her,
     gently.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Look at me, Nell.  Look at me!

     Nell manages to focus on him, her breath laboring.

                               NELL
                   Hugh Crain.  He's in the house.  
                   He's still here...

     Theo pulls back, goes very still.  The first hint of fear in her 
     eyes.

                               THEO
                   No.

     Marrow sees the panic working on her, gives her a stern look:

                               MARROW
                   Theo!  You too.  Listen to me.

     The command derails Theo's train of thought.  Marrow stares at Nell 
     in pity, can't bear it, and has to look away.  Finally he turns back 
     to her, full of regret.

                               MARROW
                   Nell, you have to hear me.  Let me 
                   explain what's happening to you.
                          (beat)
                   You're participating in a study on 
                   hysteria.

     Everyone but Marrow REACTS.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   I've given you a powerful 
                   suggestion that you're in a 
                   haunted house.  I picked Hill 
                   House because it fits the 
                   expectations.  It was my... it was 
                   my theater, my stage.

     Theo glances at Luke: he's been right all along.  This was never 
     about perception.

                               LUKE
                   Modelling small-group dynamics in 
                   the formation of narrative 
                   hallucinations.  You brought us 
                   here to scare us.  Insomnia, that 
                   was just a decoy issue.  You're 
                   disgusting.

                               NELL
                   Is this true?  I've been 
                   hypnotized?

                               MARROW
                   I hadn't done a study of how group 
                   fear affects individual 
                   performance.  Mass hysteria is 
                   like a story, Nell.  A communal 
                   story.  Someone starts it.  Then 
                   we all add a little more to it.  
                   And then for some reason -- no one 
                   knows how -- we start believing 
                   it.  This story shapes what we see 
                   and hear.  We interpret everything 
                   through it, make it fit the story.  
                   I started our story when I gave 
                   you the history of Hill House.  
                   You've added to it.  That's what 
                   this experiment has all been 
                   about.  That's what it was about, 
                   the experiment's over.  I'm 
                   pulling the plug.  This is my 
                   fault.

                               NELL
                   It's not real?  Crain?  He's not 
                   real?

     Marrow shoots him a look: shut up.

                               MARROW
                   Your fear of him was real.  That's 
                   all the ghost anyone needs.

                               THEO
                   How could you do this to people?

     Nell bucks in his arms, furious, desperate.

                               NELL
                   This is real, I'm not making it 
                   up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were 
                   there -- the banging and last 
                   night.  You, you all saw the 
                   painting!

                               THEO
                   Nell, it makes sense.  It all 
                   makes sense.  You and I, we were 
                   scaring each other, working each 
                   other up.

                               NELL
                   -- but the painting!

     Nobody says anythlng.  The silence tortures Nell.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I know you think I did that.  I 
                   didn't!  Go to the great hall and 
                   look in the fireplace!

     She starts to laugh.  Marrow gently presses Nell down, tucking the
     blanket around her.

                               MARROW
                   Why would we want to do that, 
                   Nell?

                               NELL
                   Because that's where he burned 
                   them up, the child laborers from 
                   his mills!  Because that's where 
                   their bones are!  He killed
                   hundreds.  He took them here and
                   he killed them.  Their bones are 
                   in the fireplace!

     Nell sobs.  The others exchange looks at this.  It sounds so hollow, 
     so delusional, it makes Marrow look so right.

                               MARROW
                   There are no bones in the 
                   fireplace.  Luke and I looked in 
                   it yesterday.  There's some old 
                   charred wood in the ash drop
                   but --

     Nell SPASMS trying to fight her way up, but Marrow and Luke hold her
     down.  Nell begins to wail in helpless rage.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Nell!  If we look in that 
                   fireplace it'll just make you more 
                   upset.  And when there are no 
                   bones there, you'll say they got 
                   up and walked away.

                               NELL
                   Oh, God, you're not going to 
                   look...

     Theo pushes them back and grabs Nell's hand, gently brushes Nell's
     face.

                               THEO
                   Aw, shhh Nell, shhh.

     Theo turns up to Marrow, intense, furious with him.

     Nell's hysterics have stopped.  She stares up at him, lost.  
     Searching inside herself.  Maybe she is crazy...

                               MARROW
                   There has to be Monster in the 
                   Labyrinth.  We make them up.  
                   That's how we deal with the things 
                   in everyday life that are too 
                   terrible to deal with.  Like 
                   losing someone.  Like being alone.

     Marrow reaches down to Nell, but she shrinks away.  Theo blocks 
     Marrow out, shielding Nell.  Marrow pauses, disgusted with himself.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   I'm sorry, Nell.  I'm really, 
                   really sorry I did this to you.

                               LUKE
                   Sometimes saying you're sorry is 
                   just not enough.

     A disgusted Luke leaves the room.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies in her bed, shivering.

                               NELL
                   Don't leave me.

     Theo spreads an extra blanket over Nell.

                               THEO
                   I'm going to stay with you until 
                   you fall asleep.  And then I'm 
                   going to get some brandy.

                               NELL
                   I don't think I want any.

                               THEO
                   I do.

     Theo spots a small candelabra with strings of crystal beads on the
     bedside table.  She lights the two candles.

     Theo goes and turns out the light.  Nell lies there watching the
     flicker of the candles play in the crystal.  Eddies of heat mingle 
     up the frost-covered glass of the window behind the candelabra.  
     Small streaks of frost begin to melt... We see eyes forming in the 
     melting frost, a face begins to form...

     Theo watches Nell.  There can be a TIME DISSOLVE.  Nell falls 
     asleep.  Theo tiptoes out of the room.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Luke eats chips.  Marrow stands by the door, arms folded, matter-of-
     fact.

                               MARROW
                   I gave my key to the gate to Todd, 
                   but the Dudleys'll be here in the 
                   morning.

                               LUKE
                   Do we still get paid for the week?

                               MARROW
                   You get your money.

     Awkward silence.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Where did she come up with it?  
                   How did she put it all together?

                               LUKE
                   Is that the question of compassion 
                   or science?

                               MARROW
                   It's a question.

                               LUKE
                   She got the child labor stuff from 
                   me.

     Theo comes in, she heard what they were talking about.

                               THEO
                   I... I was playing games with 
                   her... Big city games... I was 
                   bad.  And you, Doctor Morrow, you 
                   broke her heart.

     He knows this.  It tears him apart.

                               MARROW
                   Is she asleep?

                               THEO
                   Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't 
                   let her alone the whole night.

     Marrow nods, gets his briefcase, exits.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Marrow steps into the dark, vast room, his glasses glinting.  The 
     faint outline of the fireplace on the far wall looms in the 
     darkness.

     Marrow approaches it.  The mesh screen is still open.  Marrow stands
     there a moment.  Then looks in.

     He squats and tries to open the ash-drop.  It doesn't budge; it's
     jammed by the poker Nell dropped in.

     Marrow considers, then shakes his head, feels stupid for even coming
     in to check.

     Suddenly his CELL PHONE RINGS, startling him.

                               MARROW
                   Shit.
                          (answering the
                           phone)
                   Hello?  Yes, this is Dr. Marrow.
                          (beat)
                   Oh, hello.  Thank you for 
                   returning the call.
                          (beat)
                   No.  You mean he hasn't returned?
                          (long beat)
                   No, we haven't seen him.
                          (beat)
                   Can you tell me, what sort of car 
                   does he drive?
                          (beat, reacting)
                   A Toyota...

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Luke stops Theo, carrying a tray of food and tea, outside the 
     kitchen door.

                               THEO
                   We're fucked.  We're in a haunted 
                   house and we can't get out until 
                   the morning.

                               LUKE
                   You don't really believe it's 
                   haunted... Do you believe in 
                   ghosts?

                               THEO
                   That depends on your definition of 
                   ghosts.  I'm going to check on 
                   her, and then I'm going to stay 
                   awake.

                               LUKE
                   All night?

                               THEO
                   Yeah.

                               LUKE
                   You want company?

                               THEO
                   Maybe someday.

     Some sexual awareness.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies in her bed asleep, the room dark except for the last,
     guttering end of one of the candles.  It goes out.

     A FAINT SOUND.  LONG, LOW, like the inarticulate murmur of a dozen
     madmen.  Nell stirs.  Her eyes open.  She hears the sound.

     The wall on the opposite side of the room catches the pale gloom 
     from the window.  The twisting figures in the plaster, the low-
     relief, the shadows they make seem to COME TOGETHER AS AN EYE.  
     Black.  Not human.  The woodwork around it like some half-face.

     The GIBBERING begins to RISE.

     OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE she can see a FORM beside her in the 
     bed.

     Nell's mouth moves.  She manages to form words, but it's just a
     whisper.

                               NELL
                   Theo...

     Nell reaches out under the covers.

     Her HAND is suddenly grasped.

     THE EYE on the wall stares.  The babbling, liquid, deep voice 
     mounts, and as the shadows move ever so slowly, the EYE seems to 
     roam over the room.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Oh, God.  It's looking for me.

     And then the babbling stops.  Nell grimaces in pain.  She tries to 
     look at Theo, but it's far too DARK right there beside her.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Theo, my hand.  You're hurting me.

     In the place of the babbling, another sound.  High-pitched, drawn-
     out.  A CHILD'S CRY.  Nell reacts.

     The cry wails louder, coming through the wall.  It's a wail of 
     agony.  A wail not of this earth.  Nell struggles, racked between 
     the pain in her hand and the tortured child's cry.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   A child.  No.  No!  I'm right 
                   HERE!

     The EYE focusses on her.  Dead on her.  Nell stops.  And with sudden
     violence, she's WRENCHED out of the bed by whatever's beside her.  
     Nell hits the floor with a scream.  She grabs at the table on this 
     side of the bed, pulling a lamp down on her, yanking at its chain.

     The room FLASHES into brilliance.  Nell stands up, panting... There 
     is nothing in the room.  No Theo.  She looks at her hand.

     The eye on the wall is gone.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Oh, God.  Who was holding my hand?

     Nell snaps around.  There on the window, SPREADING before her eyes 
     the frost on the glass is melting into a HORRIFYING FACE.  The face 
     of CRAIN.

     Nell recoils in prickling fear.  Living fear.  Then her fear turns 
     to RAGE.  In the blink of an eye there's a heavy ashtray in her 
     hand, and it's flying at the window.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I will not let you hurt a CHILD!

     The window BASHES out into the night, the face vanishing with a HOWL
     of air.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     NeIl explodes from her room, a flying fury of hate.  The child-cry
     seems to race ahead of her into --

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- Theo's room, which is empty.  Now it seems like it's coming from 
     the door to the hall, is right there.  Nell races after it and --

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- barges out into the hallway.  She breaks into a run.  The cry 
     sounds from farther off.  Nell chases after it.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Theo carrying a pot of tea and some cups enters quietly just in case
     Nell is asleep.  She stops in surprise.  The window is smashed, lamp 
     on the floor.  Nell is gone.

                               THEO
                   Nell?

     INT. NELL'S HALLWAY - NORTH WING - NIGHT

     A panicked Theo runs out of Nell's room into the hallway.

                               THEO
                   Luke... Jim...!

     INT. CROSS HALL - NIGHT

     Halls sprawl away into darkness in all directions as Nell tries to
     feel out where she is, and realizes she's lost.  Just like Theo and 
     she were before.  But now it's night.  And she's alone.  She's been 
     tricked.

     Panting, she stops, presses herself against the wall.  Her breath
     catches.

     Across from her is a MIRROR.  Herself reflected in its tarnished
     surface.  But there is something wrong with it.  Nell steps across 
     to it.

     Her reflected self begins to SMILE.  But SHE'S NOT SMILING!  Nell
     writhes in horror, but can't pull away from the mirror.  In it, her
     GRIN WIDENS, INSANE.  The bottom half of her face is someone else's.

     BANG!  Nell recoils.  The sound breaks the spell, knocking Nell back
     from the mirror.

     BANG.  BANG.  BANG.  Nell turns and runs.

     INT. HALL OF PILLARS - NIGHT

     The banging chases Nell into the hall of pillars.  Nell turns to 
     face whatever it is that's coming after her.  The BANGING 
     CRESCENDOES... and then recedes, still audible, but like the thing 
     following her has taken a wrong turn.

     Another mirror on the wall.  Nell glimpses herself in it.  This time
     her EYES are someone else's, lit with insanity.

     Nell backs away, through doors into --

     INT. HALL OF MIRRORS - NIGHT

     -- the hall of mirrors.  Bang bang bang bang...

     The octagonal, mirror-lined pillars cast and re-cast her reflection
     throughout the room.  Nell is everywhere in plain sight, but hidden 
     by the very infinity of her images.  The BANGING grows louder.

                               NELL
                   Why do you want me?

     The BANGING ceases.  And then we see the real Nell standing there.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   WHO AM I?

     She turns around.  Her REFLECTIONS all TURN with her.  EXCEPT ONE.  
     For a long moment, we see it but Nell doesn't.

     And then she does.

     The REFLECTED NELL stands there, hands hanging, silent.

     Nell exhales in shuddering fear.  The Reflected Nell MOUTHS 
     compelling the real Nell to whisper with it:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Welcome home, Eleanor...

     With that the Reflected Nell grins and her STOMACH SWELLS before our
     eyes, pregnant just like Carolyn Crain.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No.

     Nell runs.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

     Nell races down the long hall, bare feet flying, covering her face
     from MIRRORS left and right.  She stumbles into --

     INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- the greenhouse where she slips on the marble.  She kicks the door
     shut behind her and lunges for the spiral staircase, her horror
     driving her up and up, setting the rickety thing swinging.  We HEAR
     what Nell hears, the voices of children.

                               VOICES OF CHILDREN
                   Help us... help us...

                               NELL
                   I'm here... I'm here... I'm coming 
                   to you, I'm coming to you...

     Nell climbs higher and higher into the dark reaches above.

     AS SHE CLIMBS: through the greenhouse windows we see the night sky,
     the clouds driven by the wind, the moon, old vines wrapped aroud the
     skin of the greenhouse... and the shapes and shadows of the vines 
     seem to shift as if it was alive...

     Nell reaches the landing.  The stair case rolls back and forth 
     beneath her.  A beat.  And then BAM!  The door slams open below.

                               MARROW (OC)
                   Nell!  Nell, are you in here?

     Nell can only manage sobbing relief.

                               LUKE (OC)
                   Look, the stairs!

     Nell drags herself to the hand rail.  Marrow, Luke and Theo rush 
     into view below.

     They all react to the sight of Nell at the precarious top -- with 
     her insanely happy smile.  They think she's there to kill herself.  
     Just like Rene Crain.

     They all freak out in a chorus of 'Nell!  No, Nell!'

                               MARROW
                   Nell!  Don't move.

     Nell couldn't anyway.  She just grins madly, tears running down her
     face.  Marrow grabs for the stairs, but they shift under Nell's
     movement from up above.

                               LUKE
                   It's not going to hold your 
                   weight.

                               MARROW
                   Just stay there, Nell!

     Marrow mounts the stairs.  The metal support rods sing out under his
     weight.  And the whole thing pitches, rolling around as he goes up.
     Five feet.  Ten feet.  Fifteen feet up.  The sway gets wilder as he 
     goes.

     At twenty feet, with twenty more to go to reach Nell, he stops.  The
     stairs buck, sway out dizzily.  And then to his dismay, he realizes
     he's on the WRONG SIDE of the double helix staircase.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Damn it.

     He straddles the rail to climb over to the other half.

                               LUKE
                   Don't!

     The sudden shift is too much for the old stairs.  The support rods
     CREASE and then the whole enormous column of steel from where Marrow
     is standing to the ground BURSTS from its supports.

     Luke shoves Theo aside, and the bottom half of the stairs spirals 
     out in a massive, deafening COLLAPSE.  Marrow's cellular phone falls 
     out of his pocket and shatters in hundred pieces across the floor.

     The top half of the stairs remains, still hanging from the ceiling.
     Nell grips the railing at the top.

     Marrow hangs there by one hand over the razor tangle of steel below.
     He flails out for the other stairway, swings himself over to it.  It
     takes a moment for him to realize he almost just died.  A moment of
     paralysis.  This is no longer an experiment.  No longer fun and 
     games.

                               MARROW
                   Nell?  Are you up there?

     There she is.  Marrow forces himself to start climbing the shaky
     stairs.  Luke and Theo watch from below, tense.

     Then he's there.  Nell stands a mere arm's length from him on the 
     other side of the railing.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Come on, Nell.  You have to climb 
                   over and step back on the stairs.

     Nell barely seems to hear him.  Instead she looks at the DEFORMING
     SUPPORT RODS around her.  We HEAR the voices of the CHILDREN, 
     calling to her.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Nell!  Now!

     Theo, on the ground, calls up to Nell.

                               THEO
                   Nell, go with him!  Just go with 
                   him.

     Nell refocuses on him and then gingerly climbs over the railing.  
     She hangs there.  She looks down at the tangled steel below...

                               NELL
                   The children want me.  They're 
                   calling me.  They need me.

                               MARROW
                   Nell.  You will come here now.

     Nell looks UP at him, hazy.

     And THEN BEHIND MARROW: the shifting clouds, the moon, the vines... 
     and suddenly all these random elements behind him form a dark 
     hideous face and in front of it a hand, and the hand is rushing 
     forward to PUSH MARROW OFF THE STEPS.

     After we scream, NELL SCREAMS.

                               NELL
                   NO!

     And as Marrow falls forward, pushed by the force behind him, Nell
     grabs him... he is caught on the rail... As she has reached out to 
     him, now she has fallen into thin air, and she falls towards Marrow, 
     and they hold each other.  She has a hand... then a foot... she 
     slips... she holds on again... and reaches the staircase.  She grabs 
     on.

     A moment's peace... and then a new disaster: with a metallic POP POP
     POP the support rods spring from their anchors and the rest of the
     stairwell next to them drops to the ground in a catastrophic
     shattering of sound.

     Marrow looks behind him, to whatever it was that Nell saw over his
     shoulder.  He looks back at her.  Her eyes are closed, she won't 
     open them.

                               MARROW
                   We're going down the stairs, Nell, 
                   I'm taking you down the stairs.

     He leads her go down the stairs.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marrow and Theo stand in the doorway to the shared bathroom watching
     Luke finish taping a trash bag over Nell's broken window.  Nell lies 
     in her bed, asleep or unconscious, it's impossible to say.  Luke 
     finishes, comes over.  Marrow is hushed, grim, exhausted.

                               THEO
                   She needs help.

                               MARROW
                   I'll take her with me to the 
                   University tomorrow.  I can't 
                   believe I read the test wrong.  I 
                   didn't see anything that looked 
                   like she was suicidal.

                               LUKE
                   You used the wrong test.

                               THEO
                          (indignant)
                   Will the two of you shut up!  God 
                   damn it!  Maybe the tests were 
                   right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, 
                   she's vulnerable, but I don't 
                   think she's suicidal and I didn't 
                   have to test her.  Maybe she 
                   wasn't trying to kill herself.  
                   Maybe she was really scared.  
                   Maybe she really heard voices.

     Marrow looks away, doesn't want to say this.  Theo reads the 
     feelings on his face.

                               LUKE
                   You're not telling us something.

                               MARROW
                   Watts.  Those were his keys Nell 
                   found.  His roommate called and 
                   said Watts left when he was 
                   supposed to.  I think he's here.

                               THEO
                   He's wandering around the house, 
                   and Nell heard him.  She thought 
                   it was ghosts.  Let's go look for 
                   him again.

                               MARROW
                   No.  If he's lost somewhere in the 
                   house... he'll have to stay lost 
                   until tomorrow, until the night is 
                   over.  What we have to do now is 
                   be together, with Nell.

     And they go.  Three scared people.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Luke sits on the closed toilet and watches Nell in the adjoining 
     room.  Light from the bathroom falls across her fetal, curled form 
     in the bed.

     The door to Theo's room is open too.  Luke glances over.  Theo lies 
     on her bed.  Marrow is slouched in a chair.

     Luke settles back against the wall.

     The HOUSE EXHALES, and the breath of the house is like the poppy 
     field in the Wizard of OZ; it brings on sleep.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT

     Marrow is struggling to stay awake and his eyes finally close.  Theo
     breathes hard in the grips of some awful dream.

     This is what the House wanted.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies asleep, the ornate headboard looming behind her, black 
     with its strange plant-like splay of leaves.

     Nell draws a deep, sleeping breath... and her EYES OPEN.  She lies
     there, her breath still in her lungs, not moving, but sensing
     something.  A long beat.  When she lets her breath out, we can see 
     it in the cold.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Luke's head rests solidly on the wall.  His eyes are closed, unaware
     his breath is fogging too.

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell lies there afraid to move, afraid to make the faintest sound.
     From the darkness above WOOD CREAKS.  At first it seems like someone 
     is walking on the floor above.  But it is coming from within the 
     room.

     The CARVINGS on the ceiling, the impossibly elaborate woodwork, ARE
     MOVING.  Incredibly slowly, with incredible subtlety: turning inside
     out, some of the forms lengthening, some shortening.  Carvings 
     changing here, changing there -- the ceiling coming alive -- with 
     some grand design we sense but cannot yet see.

     The wood grows out of the ceiling eating its way down into the tall
     bed POSTERS.  It crawls down the posters, straining the sinewy 
     baroque curves, swelling them...

     The CREAKING begins from the darkness of the wall opposite Nell.  
     Nell inclines her head to see.  Out of the wall two enormous BULGES 
     grow, side by side.

     From behind Nell, now.  The headboard GROANS, its shapes moving, the
     fan-like plant designs thickening and SPLAYING wide.

     Nell can't move, her mind refusing to understand what's going on.  
     The bulges in the wall DROOP to the floor.  And then we BEGIN TO 
     SEE: they are like a pair of KNEES.

     Understanding starts to show in Nell's eyes.  She looks up at the
     ceiling.  And now all the movement, the design behind the awful
     transformation of the ceiling is clear.

     It is a HEAD.  A visage of madness, of absolute horror, eyelids 
     sealing shut its blind face.

     Silence.  Nell's breath comes ragged.  Unable to speak, but trying 
     to call out.

     The EYES OPEN.  A SCREAM tears out of Nell's throat.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Luke is shocked awake in time to see Nell's room CONVULSE on her 
     just before the DOOR SLAMS in his face.

                               LUKE
                   Oh my God...

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

     The entire ROOM RAMS itself at Nell, jolting her hard into the
     headboard.  THUMBS FOLD OUT of the woodwork, pinning her by the
     shoulders against it.  As the room lowers itself toward her, she
     SCREAMS out of her mind.

     INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Marrow lunges into the bathroom, thrown from sleep as Luke stares in
     impotent shock.  Theo is there behind Marrow an instant later.

                               MARROW
                   What is it?

     Luke can't make any words come out.  Marrow shoves him aside, grabs 
     the doorknob and thrashes at it.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Help me!

     He braces Luke up, and then they lunge together, shouldering the 
     door.  It splinters out of its frame --

     INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

     -- and stumble into Nell's room.  Marrow's mouth opens.  Luke stands
     speechless.  They're stricken by the sight: Nell SCREAMING, held by 
     the headboard as the deformed ceiling dips over her, the room 
     THRUSTING at her rhythmically.  Nell and Theo make EYE CONTACT.

                               THEO
                   Oh, Jesus.

     Marrow recovers, reaches out for Nell, and the FACE in the ceiling
     turns on him.  The GAZE stops Marrow in his tracks.  He looks up 
     into it and knows it's real.  Somehow, it is Crain.

     Luke appears from out of nowhere on the other side of the bed and
     SMASHES off one of the wooden hands with a large brass candelabra.
     Nell screams in surprise, but Theo drags her out of the bed.

     The head turns to them.  They flee.  Marrow backs away in awe and 
     fear.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Luke and Theo drag Nell down the stairs into the Great Hall.  Marrow
     brings up the rear.  They retreat for the entry as Luke puts his 
     jacket over Nell's shoulders.  Marrow stops, looks back up the 
     stairs.

                               MARROW
                   Wait a second!  Wait!

     All there is are the sounds of Nell, Luke and Theo making for the 
     hall to the entry.  The House is silent.

                               LUKE
                   No.

     Luke goes out.  But Nell pauses, stopping Theo with her.

     The House is quiet.  Marrow's hand still outstretched.  Nell looks
     around the room.  There are heads everywhere, faces: animal heads,
     humans, gods, all staring from the woodwork, the carpets everything.
     All turning to her.

     Theo looks around, but can't see what Nell is seeing.  Nell's breath
     comes faster, disoriented, yet aware...

                               NELL
                   They're all in here.  All the ones 
                   he killed.  They're just children!  
                   We have to help them!

                               THEO
                          (to Marrow)
                   Come on!  Why are we waiting?

     Even now, Marrow can't believe what he just saw, but Theo's voice
     brings him back.  He whirls, grabs onto Nell, helps Theo drag her 
     out.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY/GATE - NIGHT

     Four cars sit behind the massive, locked gate, as far from Hill 
     House as possible.  Marrow paces past the fence, staring out, the 
     road beyond leading out of this place, so close...

     Luke digs with a pen knife at the marble footing below the gate.  No
     easy way under it.  He stands and gazes at the razor-sharp spikes
     twenty feet up.  There's no way to climb this.

                               THEO
                   Oh my God we need to call someone?

     Marrow just looks at her and walks back to Nell's car.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Nell sits in the passenger seat of her car, wrapped in her jacket.  
     She stares out at the gate, at Luke and Theo consulting.  Marrow 
     appears in the window.

                               MARROW
                   You okay?

     Nell nods, but there's something about her not right.

                               NELL
                   Why did you bring me here?

     Marrow shakes his head, doesn't fully understand.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Why did you call me and tell me to 
                   look in the paper for the ad?

                               MARROW
                   Nell, what are you talking about?  
                   I never called you.

     Nell stares, dismayed, but Marrow is dead serious.

                               NELL
                   But you told me to look in the 
                   paper!  You told me I'd be 
                   perfect!

                               MARROW
                   Nell, the first time I ever spoke 
                   with you in person was the night 
                   we met here.

                               NELL
                   Then who called me?

     Hill House looms behind her, windows forming eyes, the carport a
     gaping mouth.

     Nell's dismay becomes a cold, terrifying understanding, and she 
     turns and stares back up at the House.

     Luke comes up with Theo on the other side of the car.

                               THEO
                   Nell --

                               LUKE
                   -- how much is this car worth?

     EXT. HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY/GATE - NIGHT

     Theo pulls Nell away from the drive.  Marrow stands back from Nell's
     car where Luke belts in behind the wheel.

     Luke eases the car forward to the gate.  He advances until the car's
     bumper makes contact.  And then without further ado, REVS the 
     engine.

     The Buick grinds into the heavy steel bars.  The chain tightens 
     around the two halves of the gate, but shows not the slightest 
     strain.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Luke grimaces, shifts into low, pours on the gas.

     EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     The car fishes back and forth against the gate, hurling a shower of
     gravel on the other cars off to the side of the road.  Marrow, Nell 
     and Theo move back.

     One of the Buick's headlights breaks.  The grill mashes in.  For a 
     long moment the car struggles against the Gate.  No good.  Luke 
     eases up.

     Theo looks at Marrow.  Luke puts the car in reverse.

                               LUKE
                   Get the hell out of the way!

     They back way up.  Luke vanishes up the drive in the car.  And then 
     the Buick comes around the corner, accelerating, slicing down the 
     gravel road.

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Luke sits way back in the seat, grits his teeth, floors it, aiming 
     at the gate...

     EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     The car SMASHES into it... and is STOPPED, collapsing, twisting in a
     deafening hail of steel and glass.

     The massive gate has BENT itself AROUND the car, holding it in its
     steel-grip.

     EXT. GATE - NIGHT

     Nell understands, the house will not let her go.  She turns away 
     from the gate, faces the House, mesmerized by the beauty in this
     monstrosity.  The House is calling her back, and Nell is drawn 
     towards it.  She starts walking...

     INT. NELL'S CAR - NIGHT

     Luke gasps for the seat belt, the wind knocked out of him, steering
     column pushed to his chest.  Marrow and Theo run up outside.  Luke 
     sees him, sees he's not getting any closer than ten feet, and he's 
     looking back at the gas tank.

     Luke gets the seatbelt off, tries to open the door but it's warped
     shut.  He struggles to get out from behind the wheel.  Sparks jump 
     from the battery.  Gas shoots out of the fuel pump onto the 
     shattered window.  He knows he's in trouble.

                               THEO
                   Hurry.  The gas!  Luke... The gas!

     Finally Luke gets free of the wheel.  It's agonizing to watch...  
     The passenger door is jammed shut too.

     He squirms into the back seat.  The rear doors are in the same
     condition as the front.  But the rear window is blown out.  He 
     crawls out onto the trunk.

     EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT

     Marrow hurries around the back of the car, staying clear of the lake
     of gas spreading about it.  Luke rolls off.  Marrow helps him up, 
     and gets him away a safe distance.

                               LUKE
                   I'm okay.  Okay.  Just my chest.  
                   Just my wind knocked out.

     Marrow looks up at the gate.  It is even more impassible than before
     with the gasoline-saturated wreck in it.  No way to try another 
     break-out either.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   Sorry about your car, Nell.

     He turns around.  The others do too.

     No Nell.  Luke and Theo look up.  Mute dread.  No Nell anywhere.

                               MARROW
                   Oh, no.

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT

     The massive black door swings silently into the dark, vaulted entry.
     Marrow pauses there, looks about, and then enters.  He holds a tire
     iron.

     Luke does too.  He and Theo follow Marrow in.

                               THEO
                   I'm sure she went back to her 
                   room.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     They stay to the outside of the stairs, padding silently up, trying 
     to get a glimpse of the floor above.  It's shrouded in darkness.

     They turn at the landing, eyes riveted to the top of the stairs.  
     They start up.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY, NORTH WING - NIGHT

     Marrow, Luke and Theo pause at the top of the stairs and peer down
     both long, empty directions of the hallway.

     Then Marrow turns toward Nell and Theo's room.  The brass 
     candelabra... in front of the open door.

     The rooms draw nearer, closer.  Not even the sound of their 
     breathing.

     The door is ajar.  Marrow pushes it open with the tire iron.  The 
     room lies in silent disarray.  Normal disarray.  The bed normal.  
     The ceiling normal.  No Nell.

     Marrow and Theo REACT and enter the room.  Luke lingers out in the 
     hall a moment.  And just as he steps in after them we HOLD on the 
     long, empty hall --

     -- and a FIGURE glides across.  Far down at the other end.  She
     disappears.  It was Nell.

     INT. STATUARY HALL - NIGHT

     Nell walks through the row of dark statues.  Carved faces watch her
     pass.

     INT. HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     Nell stands before the threshold of the horrific doors, once locked,
     now inexplicably OPEN.  The mythological frieze on the door split in
     half, a world cut in two, a seal broken.  Like something has come 
     out of its tomb.

     Nell steps into the blackness.

     INT. THEO'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marrow comes out of the bathroom, joining Theo by the window next to
     her bed.  Luke stands in the doorway.

                               THEO
                   Was sure she'd be in here.

                               LUKE
                          (worried)
                   Where in the hell can she be.

     Marrow remembers.

                               MARROW
                   Oh no...

     INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

     Marrow, Luke and Theo enter the greenhouse, the heavy growth
     forbidding in the darkness.  They spread out on the parallel 
     walkways.

                               THEO
                   Nell?

     They reach the transept, turn down it toward the statue of Crain at
     the end looming white in the dusk.

     Dead silence.  Then Marrow SCREAMS.

     Under a thin layer of ice underneath the giant hand that protrudes
     from the pond we find Watt's body, as if the hand wants to keep him
     there forever.  Marrow did find his Watts, a horrifying sight.

                               MARROW
                   Oh my God it's Watts.

     As at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a 
     river of blood, scaring the hell out of them.  Their clothes 
     splattered with blood, Marrow quickly leads them out of there.

     INT. LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT

     Nell stands there in the darkness, sensing the expanse of the room,
     turning... and kicking something on the floor.

     It is a wooden toy train.  Then she sees a rocking horse by her 
     feet.  It is a NURSERY.  Turn-of-the-century.

     And as Nell's eyes adjust, as she tries to see what else is in here 
     in the dark, she begins to make out WHITE SHROUDED SHAPES.

     Against the wall.  A bed covered in a sheet.  A table beside it.  A 
     HAND BELL.  A CANE.

     Just like Nell's sick room at home.  Nell realizes it, covers her
     mouth.

     The furniture is in EXACTLY the same position, though the sheets
     covering the pieces are stained, FAR OLDER.

     And on the wall, something in a frame is covered with a piece of
     sheet.

     Nell approaches it in trepidation and removes the cloth.  For a long
     beat, all we see is her face as it goes slack.  Understanding.

     The framed thing is a stitchery.  It says: A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING,
     EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE.

     Just like the one at home.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Marrow, Theo and Luke barge into the Great Hall.

                               THEO
                   Nell!

                               LUKE
                   We can't stay here looking for 
                   her.  She doesn't want to be 
                   found...

     Marrow and Theo look at him.  It's what they've been thinking, but
     haven't had the courage to say.  Theo stops suddenly.  Turns around.  
     The men notice, and pause.

     Then they hear it.  Faint.  Floating down from upstairs somewhere.
     Nell's TUNE.  It doesn't sound right, but it's hard to tell as it's
     coming from so far away.

     They look at each other, start for the stairs.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT

     Theo, Marrow and Luke stand at the end of the dark hallway.  They 
     stare at the gaping doors to the nursery at the far end.  The tune 
     is coming from within.  Abruptly, it stops.

     And instead of Nell's tune, there's a repetitive CREAK.  CREAK.  
     CREAK.

     In rising dread, Theo starts forward.

     It takes Marrow and Luke a moment to come after her.  The CREAKING 
     gets louder, unnerving.

     They get to the doors, Theo first.  She pushes them wide.

     INT. LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT

     They stop there, staring into the shadows.

                               THEO
                   Nell?

     And there, hunched over something turning a CREAKING CRANK of some
     sort, is Nell.

                               MARROW
                   Nell.

     Nell straightens from whatever it is she was doing and turns to 
     them.  Theo steps toward her, afraid for her.

                               THEO
                   What'd you come back for, babe?

                               NELL
                   Just had to be sure.

                               LUKE
                   Come on, Jesus!  Let's go!

     Marrow shuts him up with a vicious gesture, stays back himself as 
     Theo approaches Nell.

                               THEO
                   Let's go, hon.  Don't you want to 
                   go back to your little apartment 
                   where you can hear the buoy out in 
                   the harbor when the wind is just 
                   right?

     Nell smiles at Theo.  She's holding something.

                               NELL
                   Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have 
                   an apartment.

                               THEO
                   Then let's go get you one.

     Nell's smile softens even more.  Her voice is reassuring.

                               NELL
                   Don't worry about me, Theo.  I'm 
                   wanted.  Right here.  I'm home.

     A CHILL of fear cuts through Theo as Nell looks deep into her eyes.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   After all...
                          (beat)
                   I'm family.

     The thing in Nell's hand is a NEEDLE, the thing she's been cranking 
     an ANCIENT PHONOGRAPH.  She lowers the needle to the spinning 
     record.  And HER TUNE, the one she hums all the time, begins to 
     play.

     The others are frozen where they stand.  Marrow's mind reels at the
     implications of what he's hearing.

                               MARROW
                   No.

                               NELL
                   My mother used to hum this to me.  
                   Like her mother hummed it to her.  
                   And my great grandmother Carolyn 
                   hummed it to her.

     Nell turns back.  The others stand there speechless.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   I have to stay.  You better go.  I 
                   could explain it, but you'd never 
                   understand.

     And that, finally, galvanizes the others into action.  Marrow sweeps
     past Theo, grabs Nell hard, and swings her for the door.

                               MARROW
                   Come on.

                               NELL
                   No --

                               THEO
                   Please, Nell, just see us out.

     Luke closes in on Nell with Marrow, and there's nothing she can do 
     but let herself be pulled along.

     INT. GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

     Down the stairs they come, Luke out in front now, bounding down a 
     half flight ahead.  Marrow and Theo support Nell between them.

     Nell looks up at the hooded painting of Crain, but is spun around 
     and taken down the next flight.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Nell, Marrow and Theo reach the bottom of the stairs and pause.  
     Luke is halfway across the room, looking back to make sure they're 
     with him --

     -- and Nell digs her heels in, jerking Marrow and Theo to a stop.  
     She stares.  The others follow her gaze.

     She's looking down the connecting hall, out to the entry at the 
     front doors.  They're open.

                               NELL
                   In the night...

     The DOOR BAMS SHUT with a concussion that rocks the entire room,
     sweeping Luke's jacket under it.  The HANDLES TURN, LOCK DOWN.

     Stunned.  All stunned.

     A RUSH OF AIR.  The House EXHALES.  Silence.  And then CREEEEAK.  
     They cast their eyes back up the stairs.

     BUMP BUMP.  Far-off sounds, hair-raising, of infinite variety, carry
     down the halls.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   ...In the dark.

     Luke rushes from the room.

     INT. GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT

     Luke YELLS and throws himself at the front doors.  Marrow runs over 
     to help him and shoves the tire iron between the doors and PRIES.  
     Marrow throws the useless thing down and stands back.

     Luke joins him, and they shoulder block it together.  But this door 
     is MASSIVE.  There's no way.

                               LUKE
                   No you bastard!  Break!

     He roundhouse kicks it, hurts himself.

     Theo, afraid, watches the Great Hall behind them.  Nell puts her 
     hand on her shoulder.

                               NELL
                   It's not safe for you anymore.  
                   The children need me, and Crain is 
                   doing everything he can to keep me 
                   from them.

     Theo stares, appalled.  Marrow looks around, puts his hand up to 
     shush everyone.  The HOUSE MOANS, the BUMPING growing, searching.

                               MARROW
                   Come on.

     He rushes down the hall, Luke right beside him, Nell and Theo in 
     their wake.

     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     Luke's first barging into the kitchen.  Big windows all along the 
     wall.  Huge windows.  Marrow follows him in, Luke's fear turning 
     into a vicious smile as he sees the towering windows.

     Nell and Theo are right behind in time to see Luke and Marrow 
     scooping up a table and chair respectively.

                               LUKE
                   Watch out!

     The men rush the same window, side-by-side, and let the heavy pieces
     of furniture fly from ten feet.

     The WINDOW SHATTERS, dozens of panes blown out into the darkness
     beyond.  But the metal LATTICE remains, the chair's legs stuck in 
     it.

     Marrow and Luke pause, taken back a beat.  They hustle over to it.  
     Theo and Nell stand a few feet back.

     Luke grabs the chair, levers it, tries to pry open the metal.  
     Marrow reaches through, knocking loose glass, trying to find some 
     sort of handle on the other side.

                               THEO
                   Hurry!

     Theo watches the door behind them.  Luke pries at the inch of metal
     between him and freedom.  It won't break.

                               MARROW
                   They don't open!

     Marrow slips on the broken glass and catches hold of the lattice
     LACERATING his ring and little finger.  With a cry of pain, he lands 
     on the floor.

                               MARROW (cont'd)
                   Oh Jesus my hand.

     Nell and Theo fall to the floor to help him.  Marrow moans, and Nell
     grips his injured hand in hers.  Fast, like she was born a trauma
     doctor, Nell clamps off the blood with her fingers.

                               NELL
                   Give me your shoelace.

     Marrow tugs at his shoe, in shock, and looks at Nell.  She's calm.
     Terrifyingly calm.  And in that moment, he realizes she's not out of
     her mind.  She just understands things beyond what he could possible
     begin to understand.

                               MARROW
                   What'll happen to us, Nell?

                               NELL
                   Nothing, if you leave right now.  
                   There's a war going on all around 
                   us.  Don't get in the way, please.

     Nell cinches the shoelace tight around his wrist.

     Luke throws down the chair, giving up on the window.

                               LUKE
                   Shit!  All right, you 
                   sonofabitch...

     As he looks up at another one of Crain's painting hanging on the 
     wall.  Nell Theo with Marrow straggle toward the great hall.

     INT. VESTIBULE TOWARDS GREAT HALL - NIGHT

                               LUKE
                   Maybe this'll get your attention!

     Luke flicks a LIGHTER out of his pocket.

                               MARROW
                   Luke!

     Before anyone can stop him, he LIGHTS a towering TAPESTRY on fire.

     He races from one to the next, lighting them.  Theo and Nell help
     Marrow up, back away as Luke shoots by.

     All the tapestries are ON FIRE, blazing up like torches.

     At last, his rage spent, heaving, he moves to join the others at the
     center of the room.  They stare at him, appalled, afraid.  Knowing 
     he has done something wrong.

     Luke stops.  Maybe fifteen feet away.  He sees their expressions.

                               LUKE
                   What?

     Nell looks over at the burning tapestries.  Heat sears the stone,
     blackens the carved figures in the woodwork.

     The ruddy light casts deep shadows throughout the room.

                               LUKE (cont'd)
                   We'll get out after this wing 
                   burns down.  Let's go.

     But there's no need.  The tapestries are consuming themselves too 
     fast to ignite the walls or ceiling.  They all realize it.  As the 
     last flaming scraps of cloth fall to the floor and go out, there is 
     utter silence.

     INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     Luke looks at them helplessly.  An awful, impending beat.  Without
     warning, the huge PERSIAN CARPET he's standing on JERKS out from 
     under him.  Luke falls on his stomach.

     Stunned, Luke looks straight into Nell's eyes.  Then the carpet 
     slides fast for the FIREPLACE.  It whips up to the hearth and sends 
     Luke flying through the chain curtains.

     The others are speechless.  They can do nothing but watch as Luke 
     lays there on the ashdrop.  A long moment.

                               NELL
                          (to the house, to
                           Crain)
                   No!  No!  Let them go!

     She knows what is going to happen, is powerless to prevent it.  Luke
     stands up, has time to give her a look.

     And then the LION'S HEAD FLUE drops open behind him.  Luke looks 
     back into its iron eyes --

     -- and with SHOCKING SPEED the FLUE snaps shut again, taking Luke's
     head off his body.

     The decapitated corpse falls back in the fireplace like a puppet 
     with its strings cut.

     Nell, Marrow and Theo stand there.  Not sure of what just happened,
     their minds unable to accept it.

     A sound comes up in Theo's throat.  A sob.  A horrified whimper.  
     Marrow and Nell stand there speechless.  It's as if saying the 
     obvious will make it real:

                               MARROW
                   Luke.

     BANG.  The blood-splattered LION'S HEAD drops open.  Luke's head 
     falls out.

     Theo SCREAMS and SCREAMS again.  Nell backs away with Marrow, almost
     has the presence of mind to drag them away, but --

     -- CLANG!  The ASH DROP OPENS.  The sudden sound stops them in their
     tracks.

     As they watch, it's as if the House INHALES.  And BOOM!

     Out of the ash drop EXPLODES a hail of BONES, SKULLS, FLYING ASH.

     Nell, Theo and Marrow back up toward the Grand Staircase as TONS OF
     INCINERATED HUMAN REMAINS vomit from the fireplace, blasting across
     the floor, knocking over furniture with shocking violence.  Skulls
     bounce over wood.  Hundreds of them.

     Theo and Marrow cover their faces as shattered bits of bone, loose
     teeth pelt them.  Nell is immune.

     They run up the Grand Staircase toward the top and finally it can't
     reach them anymore.

     INT. MEZZANINE - NIGHT

     They look out at the full scope of Crain's horror.

                               THEO
                   Oh God, we can't get out!

                               MARROW
                   Nell, what do we do?

                               NELL
                   He played hide and seek with the 
                   children.  That's how he built the 
                   house.

     Marrow stares at her, trembling.  He glances around at the winding
     labyrinth of house.  Impossible.

                               MARROW
                   We can't hide in here!  We won't 
                   make it til morning.

     Nell looks at him, pitying.  Infinitely sad, but guarding them.

                               NELL
                   I know.

     Behind them the huge painting of Hugh Crain in a golden frame with
     sharp metal spikes, looks down at them.  The room inhales and 
     exhales, the bumping sound resumes.  A rumble runs through the house 
     and they all look down in fear toward the great hall where a cloud 
     of ashes still hangs in the air.

     Unseen by them, this rumble start to shake the painting behind them.
     The sound from the great hall makes Marrow and Theo back up more, 
     but Nell doesn't move... she senses something is about to happen and 
     she will fight it...

     She suddenly turns and sees the painting... in a flash she reaches 
     out for Marrow and Theo, pull them out of the way as the giant 
     painting with the huge skull, falls face down toward them.  It 
     misses them by a hair, but their clothes are shredded by the spikes.

     Marrow and Theo are-shocked as they back up right toward the GRIFFIN
     on top of the staircase.

     For a split second the BRASS Griffin right behind them, comes alive,
     opens it's fangs and claws and is ready to attack... but Nell sees 
     the danger, grabs a human bone and batters the griffin.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   No, no, you leave them alone!

     And the griffin turns back into brass.  Marrow and Theo unaware of 
     what happened behind them.  They have to get out of there.

     INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Nell leads Marrow and Theo down the dark hallway, the twisted 
     woodwork along the walls frozen, but seeming poised to reach out, 
     trip someone, grab a sleeve.

     It is a nightmare House.  Doing what it was made for.

     The BUMPING they've left behind seems to vanish up and into the
     ceiling.  It gives chase, on the floor above.  Nell keeps looking 
     back, and every time she does the BUMPING seems to get more firm, 
     MORE LIKE A FOOTSTEP.  Calm, Nell urges them on.

                               NELL
                   Hurry.

     The FOOTSTEPS upstairs come faster; whatever's up there moving 
     better, more naturally.

     Theo and Marrow turn LEFT through an archway.  Nell looks back at 
     the ceiling.  The thing's moving fast.

     She dodges toward the archway where Theo and Marrow went, and STOPS.
     It's a wall.  Solid wall.  There's no archway here!  Nell backs 
     away.  Alone.

     The House has separated them.

     Nell tries to open any of the hall doors, but they are all locked.
     There's no other way then going back.

     INT. MEZZANINE - DAY

     Nell is back in the mezzanine, steps carefully over Crain's 
     painting.  The long white lace curtains in front of a side window 
     start to flutter in the wind... but the window is closed!

     Nell walks up to the top of the stairs, her back to the window, 
     calls out:

                               NELL
                   Jim!  Theo!

     No answer, and as she steps forward, listening for a reply, the
     CURTAIN BILLOWS OUT behind her, and in its movement, becomes for a
     split second, the image of CRAIN, GRABBING for her.

     Nell, oblivious, steps just OUT OF REACH, and as the breeze fails, 
     the contours and patterns of the billowing curtain dissolve into 
     chaos.  Nell glances back at it, just sees curtain, and looks up at 
     the open window.

     She turns from it, determined, and starts out to find her friends 
     and walks down the steps.

     INT. GRAND STAIRCASE/GREAT HALL - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON THE BRASS GRIFFINS that guard the staircase.

     Behind Nell's back they all turn toward her, follow her with their
     eyes as Nell enters the great hall.  And they cower in fear for what 
     is about to happen.  Again Nell call's out for Theo and Marrow.

     And Nell doesn't see the scores of TINY ARMS OF CHILDREN that fold 
     out from the carvings in the high backed chairs in the hall as Nell
     carefully avoids stepping on the skulls and bones of the children 
     that cover the floor.

     Horrifyingly alive are these TINY HANDS as reach out for her hair
     after she passes.  We're screaming as they almost have her... and 
     Nell steps away.

     And then... CREAK... CREAK... CREAK...

     The terrified animal heads on the balustrade, their eyes flash in
     fear.  The lions above the big fireplace snarl restlessly.

     Cherubim, afraid, clasp hands.  Gods and men pay unwilling witness 
     to what is now coming down the stairs.

     The upper flight of stairs strains under the weight of the thing
     coming down, over our heads, coming down, down... and now at the
     landing.  The sound stops.

     Nell's BREATH escapes, visible in the cold as she watches, rooted to
     the floor in the Grand Entry.

     Darkness against darkness.  Something BLOCKS the glint of the gilded
     frame up on the landing.  Something huge.  A beat.

     And then a SHADOW sweeps across the scene, impenetrable, darkening 
     the stairs, wiping them from sight, like something gliding down 
     them.

     Before our eyes, out of the most subtle variation of shadow, 
     flickers into existence:

     THE SHAPE, tall, eight or nine feet, featureless, black, but in the
     proportions of an enormous man with his head bowed, shoulders 
     stooped.  And just like that, all it is...

     ...is a well of darkness and night once again.  We don't even know 
     for sure what we just saw.  But it is still there in that bar of 
     shadow.

     Nell goes rigid, not breathing, not seeing anything but the awful
     presence.  She is spellbound.

     BANG.  A door in the connecting passage opens, and Theo and Marrow 
     come out, between Nell in the entry and the thing in the Great Hall 
     beyond.

     In a flash the SHAPE is moving at Theo and Marrow.  They don't see 
     it, have their backs turned.

                               THEO
                   Nell!  There you --

     But Nell is looking past them.  They see her face and turn around.

                               NELL
                   Nooo, not them!

     What is coming at them makes the blood stop.

     The Shape rushes from the Great Hall, vanishing as it crosses the
     pools of moonlight, reforming darker as it hits shadow again, its 
     wake like a shockwave, invisible itself, but VISIBLE IN ITS EFFECTS:

     Theo SCREAMS.  Marrow stumbles back.  And then Nell's voice rings 
     out:

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Is this where she bashed your 
                   brains in?

     The onrushing presence STOPS.  Seems to turn its attention to Nell,
     standing there before the towering front doors.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   When you came in the door?  I bet 
                   that was the last thing you 
                   expected.  Right?  From Carolyn?
                          (beat)
                   You thought, oh, Carolyn, I've 
                   taken it all out of her, you 
                   thought, Oh, Carolyn, she's no 
                   threat.  Carolyn.  Great Grandma 
                   Carolyn.  Did you know that?

     Nell shows no fear.  There's a ferocious edge to her voice.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   She found out what you did, and 
                   she knew there was only one way to 
                   stop you.  And she stopped you, so 
                   you couldn't torture anymore of 
                   the living.
                          (beat)
                   But you wouldn't even let go of 
                   the dead, would you?  Well, now 
                   I'm here.  They called me.  Did 
                   you know that?  They've been 
                   crying out for help for a long 
                   time.  And I heard them.

     She points out at the human remains strewn all over the Great Hall.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   And I won't let you hurt them 
                   anymore.

     The SHAPE hovers there, silent.  Air and shadow distort around it.  
     The carved animal heads on the Newell posts and walls loll back and 
     forth, alive then not-alive.  Pieces of furniture stamp in fury, try 
     to animate themselves, but can't find limbs that work.

                               NELL (cont'd)
                   Come on, Hugh Crain, you know what 
                   to do.  We've both been here 
                   before.

     The SHAPE HOWLS FORWARD, knocking everyone out of their seats.  It
     flies across the floor at Nell.

     Marrow and Theo are slammed against the walls out of its way.

     Nell OPENS WIDE HER ARMS in an EMBRACE.

     It's ON HER, but just as it seems to hit, it SPLITS like she went
     right through it.  The SHAPE and all the debris in its wake IMPACTS
     deep in the enormous doors.

     The carved WOODWORK seems to suck it all in, cracking, groaning.  
     And then all the SCREAMS are cut off.

     Nell stands there with her arms spread.  A long moment.

     She opens her eyes.

     And then the woodwork LASHES OUT, grabs her from behind, slams her
     back against the doors.  THE BLOW HAS KILLED HER.

     We feel her bones break as she crumples, is drawn into the woodwork.

     And for a few seconds Nell's body just hangs there... and then it
     gently falls down.

     Theo lets out a horrified cry as she runs toward Nell.

                               THEO
                   NELL!

     Marrow gets up off the floor in terror and awe, his life his 
     beliefs changed forever.  He walks over to Nell and feels her pulse, 
     knowing it is a useless gesture as Theo softly moans over Nell.

     And as the camera pans up across the entry door, we see a new 
     carving in the sculpted doors.  It is a woman and as we move in we 
     can see that she wears the same necklace as Nell...

     INT. HILL HOUSE FRONT DOORS, ENTRY - EARLY MORNING

     The HOUSE INHALES.  And BOOM!

     The front doors blast wide.  Every door in the entry slams open.

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

     Against the early light of a rising sun, the silhouette of Hill 
     House. Every window and every door in the House is open, each and 
     every one CRYING OUT with a different, unintelligible voice, like a 
     soul, the soul of a child, escaping from each one.

     EXT. GATE - DAWN

     Theo and Marrow stand on the far side of Nell's wrecked car.  On the
     other side of the gate Mr. Dudley is undoing the chain.  Mrs. Dudley
     stares at the ragged duo.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                          (her final verdict)
                   City people.

     Mr. Dudley can barely get one side of the gate open with the car
     crushed in it.  Theo and Marrow emerge, dazed, into the real world
     again.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   You find out what you wanted to 
                   know, mister?

     Marrow stares at him, he's an exhausted man.  He walks away, Theo
     beside him.

                               THEO
                   I'm not going back to New York 
                   City.  I'm going to find an 
                   apartment with a little flower 
                   garden, where you can just see the 
                   ocean and at night, when the wind 
                   comes in just right, you can hear 
                   the sound of the harbor.  What 
                   about you?

                               MARROW
                   I'm a scientist.  I just conducted 
                   an experiment.  Now I have to 
                   write it up.

                               THEO
                   But the experiment was a failure.

     Now, we could have him say this line...

                               MARROW
                   Was it?

     But he should just look at her, and say the same thing with his 
     eyes.

     We pull back.

     EXT. BERKSHIRE HILLS - DAY (AERIAL)

     The summer hills lie green, passing fast underneath.  Clearings loom
     out of the forest ahead.  And there, its sprawling stone in the
     sunshine, rises Hill House.

                                                       FADE OUT.



     ALTERNATE ENDING

     EXT. GATE - DAWN

     Theo and Marrow stand on the far side of Nell's wrecked car.  On the
     other side of the gate Mr. Dudley is undoing the chain.  Mrs. Dudley
     stares at the ragged duo.

                               MRS. DUDLEY
                          (her final verdict)
                   City people.

     Mr. Dudley can barely get one side of the gate open with the car
     crushed in it.  Theo and Marrow emerge, dazed, into the real world
     again.

                               MR. DUDLEY
                   You find out what you wanted to 
                   know, mister?

     Marrow stares at him, he's an exhausted man.  He walks away, Theo
     beside him.

     As they walk away, the SOUND OF APPLAUSE comes up.

                                                       WE DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. PRINTING PLANT - DAY

     Where the applause turns out to be the sound of a press finishing a
     run of a book.  This could be shot in an old press in England, or a
     foundry, with a few pieces of equipment to suggest a press.  There 
     are stacks of books.  This is the printing press in Hell.  The NOISE 
     is deafening.

     The title of the book: FEAR AND PERFORMANCE.

     Marrow stands before a mountain of copies of the book.  A PRINTER 
     very proudly hands him a copy.

                               PRINTER
                          (has to shout)
                   First copy!

     Marrow opens the book.  The Printer looks at the page over his
     shoulder.

                               PRINTER (cont'd)
                          (reads)
                   This book is dedicated to Eleanor 
                   Vance, Luke Sanderson, Rene Crain 
                   and Carolyn Crain.
                          (to Marrow)
                   They'll be happy to see this.  
                   Their names in a book, it kind of 
                   makes them immortal, doesn't it?

     Marrow looks at him.

                               MARROW
                   In a way.

     Marrow studies the page.  We go into the whiteness of the page to:

     EXT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     Where we find Theo.  The House is beautiful today, it's sunny, there
     are flowers outside, the mood has changed.  Theo is now softened, 
     she's found something better than what she had.  She goes into the 
     house.

     INT. HILL HOUSE - DAY

     Theo is in the House.  She looks around, walks up the stairs.

                               THEO
                   Nell?... Nell?

     EXT. BERKSHIRE HILLS - DAY (AERIAL)

     The summer hills lie green, passing fast underneath.  Clearings loom
     out of the forest ahead.  And there, its sprawling stone in the
     sunshine, rises Hill House.

The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on 
               the African continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT 
               rises up. WE PUSH IN on it, towards a CITY along the Nile, 
               it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP PUSHING IN until 
               the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves 
               DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not 
               ancient.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS.

                                    THEBES - 2,134 B.C

               Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent:

                                     NARRATOR
                         Thebes. City of the Living. Crown 
                         jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

               The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn 
               CHARIOT comes barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; 
               an aristocratic, virile old man. The chariot WIPES FRAME.

               INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK

               Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, 
               muscular MAN with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Home of Imhotep, High Priest of 
                         Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

               A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It 
               takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's 
               wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked 
               body has been PAINTED in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a 
               stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's 
                         Mistress. No other man was allowed 
                         to touch her.

               She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA 
               comes to a stop on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then 
               it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's really a strange looking 
               TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald MEN stand 
               nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their 
               eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains.

               Anck-su-namun embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, 
               feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam over her perfect body, 
               smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with lust:

                                     NARRATOR
                         But for our love, we were willing to 
                         risk life itself.

               And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself 
               on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush 
               over and close the doors. But just as they do, the doors 
               suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily strides in, looks at 
               the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, -- 
               SUBTITLED.

                                     PHARAOH
                         What are you doing here?

               The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival 
               was unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws 
               them back.

               Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh 
               sees the smeared body paint. Points his finger.

                                     PHARAOH
                         WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!

               From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. 
               Pharaoh spins around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked.

                                     PHARAOH
                         Imhotep?... My priest.

               Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into 
               his back.

               Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous 
               bald Priests SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the 
               curtains, they see the SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep 
               stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the doors are RAMMED from 
               the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun turn and 
               look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers 
               share desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and 
               grab Imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony.

                                     PRIESTS
                         Pharaoh's bodyguards!

               Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's 
               sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony.

                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
                         You must go. Save yourself. Only you 
                         can resurrect me.

               Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN.

               MEN with BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over 
               their bodies stride in, armed to the teeth. These are the 
               MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out onto the dark balcony 
               just as the Mumia rip through the curtains.

               Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses --

                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
                         My body is no longer his temple!

               She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. Out on the balcony, 
               Imhotep's mouth opens into a horrible silent scream...

                                     NARRATOR/IMHOTEP
                         For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's 
                         body was to be cursed. And it was I, 
                         the High Priest, whose duty it was 
                         to curse it.

               EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT

               Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-
               su-namun's mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They put her 
               down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Her body was mummified, her vital 
                         organs removed and placed in sacred 
                         canopic jars.

               Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of 
               pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         The Book of The Living contained 
                         sacred incantations that would send 
                         the evil dead on a journey into the 
                         dark underworld.

               Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves 
               and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled 
               eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising.

               Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, 
               and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the 
               ground.

               Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus.

               The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand. 
               Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears 
               at the Nubians. Killing them.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         The slaves were killed...

               Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed 
               Soldiers, hacking at them in the flickering darkness as 
               Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ...and the soldiers who killed them 
                         were also slain, so that no unholy 
                         person should ever know the exact 
                         location of the burial site.

               The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one, the 
               Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
               vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant 
               dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's 
               grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.

               EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT

               CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the 
               way. A "hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF 
               ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP. The chariots race across the map.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         But there was another book, The Book 
                         Of The Dead, which was never to be 
                         opened, never to be read, for it 
                         contained the incantations that could 
                         bring a dead body back to life a 
                         most unholy thing.

               The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. 
               They race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:

                              HAMUNAPTRA - City of the Dead

                                     IMHOTEP
                         It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of 
                         the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         so that no such sacrilege might ever 
                         disgrace Egypt.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT

               Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT 
               inside the giant STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and 
               lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD, made of black stone.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         But for my love of Anck-su-namun I 
                         was willing to defy the gods.

               INT. UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT

               Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the 
               headstones of this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY.

               A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the cemetery, -- muck made out of 
               filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in the goop. The 
               Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless 
               eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and 
               forth as they CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures.

               In the middle of the circle is a strange, twisted ALTAR.

               Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous, lifeless 
               body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun's vital organs were 
                         still fresh, so a human sacrifice 
                         would not need be made.

               As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large 
               SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. Several 
               Priests look over at it, frightened, then quickly look back 
               down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST wafts up out of the 
               swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them 
               and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the 
               heart inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING 
               HOLE, WAFTING MIST, BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are 
               reaching a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun soul had come back 
                         from the dead! Now all that was 
                         needed, was to return her organs to 
                         their rightful place within her body.

               Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's 
               breast, about to plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and 
               BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's when the Mumia BURST IN and 
               storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD MUMIA SMASHES 
               the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks 
               back out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the 
               swirling hole.

               Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS 
               in rage. The Mumia grab him and his Priests.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         My Priests were condemned to be 
                         mummified alive.

               INT. EMBALMING CHAMBER (NECROPOLIS RE-VAMP) - NIGHT

               Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed 
               EMBALMERS. He cringes at the flickering, impressionistic 
               glimpses of his Priests being embalmed and mummified alive.

               The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives, needles and 
               thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING 
               Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.

               A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.

               A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His 
               eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red 
               hot poker up his nose.

               But just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, 
               horrified, as OFF CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.

               WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests 
               squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees.

               His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         As for me, I was condemned to endure 
                         the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient 
                         curses. One so horrible, it had never 
                         before been bestowed.

               Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's 
               TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on 
               top of it. WE GO TIGHT on IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is 
               apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue 
               onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.

               Imhotep is WRAPPED ALIVE. Only his mouth, nostrils and 
               fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus 
               muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the 
               fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms.

               He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS.

               An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.

               Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the 
               bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting 
               dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face.

               Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         By eating the sacred scarabs, I would 
                         be cursed to stay alive forever. And 
                         by eating me, they were cursed just 
                         the same.

               The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange 
               four-sided KEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight.

               The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a 
               loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. Once again, the Head Mumia 
               uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         I was to remain sealed inside my 
                         sarcophagus, the undead for all of 
                         eternity.

               The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses 
               the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle 
               BOX.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         They would never allow me to be 
                         released. For I would arise a walking 
                         disease, a plague upon mankind, an 
                         unholy flesh-eater, with the strength 
                         of ages, power over the sands, and 
                         the glory of invincibility.

               Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The 
               disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and 
               then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         And if I could raise my beloved Anck-
                         su-namun from her place in hell, 
                         together, we would be an unstoppable 
                         infection upon this world. The 
                         Apocalypse. The End.

               Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming 
               from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt 
               onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM:

                                        THE MUMMY

               The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave.

               Looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, 
               the jackal-headed god of death. It stares at us. Then begins 
               to DECAY before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only 
               seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half-
               buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.

               EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY

               Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG 
               HORSEMAN.

               Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior 
               brethren. Armed to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN 
               are the WORDS:

                                    THE SAHARA - 1925

               A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN 
               LEGIONNAIRES scurry through the ruins, preparing for the 
               onslaught. OUR HERO is up on the wall. His Kepi sits at a 
               jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is RICK O'CONNELL.

               He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at 
               him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I knew this was gonna be a lousy 
                         day.

               A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across 
               the top of the wall. This is BENI.

                                     BENI
                         Personally, I would like to surrender. 
                         Why can we not just surrender?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

               Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Then let's run away. Right now. While 
                         we can still make it.

               O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Now gimme your revolver, you'll never 
                         use it anyway.

               Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody 
                         ever does that anymore.

               O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Now go find me a big stick.

                                     BENI
                         In the desert? What for?

               O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So I can tie it to your back, you 
                         appear to be without a spine.

               The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. 
               Scimitars RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         How'd a guy like you end up in the 
                         Legion anyways?

                                     BENI
                         I got caught robbing a synagogue. 
                         Lots of good stuff in them holy 
                         places; churches, temples, mosques, 
                         and who's guarding them?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Altar boys?

                                     BENI
                         Exactly! I speak seven languages, 
                         including Hebrew, so my specialty 
                         was synagogues. How about you? Kill 
                         somebody?

               Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground.

               O'Connell gives him a nasty look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No, but I'm considering it.

               They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp

                                     BENI
                         What then? Robbery? Extortion? 
                         Kidnapping!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         None of the above, thank you.

                                     BENI
                         Then what the hell are you doing 
                         here!?

               They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the 
               horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening.

               O'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I was just looking for a good time.

               And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly 
               panics, cuts and runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh shit. Steady!

               Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde 
               Hoofs pounding the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         STEADY!
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell am I sayin'?

               The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog 
               SCREAMS. More Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         STEADY!!
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell am I doin'?

               The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels 
               himself, cocks and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly 
               snaps, he spits it into the sand. Another BEAT. And then --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with 
               a CRASH. The BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their 
               mounts. The prone Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand.

               The remaining warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the 
               hot air. A third of the Legionnaires are killed instantly.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off 
               their mounts. Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg 
               force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires.

               O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts CLUBBING 
               riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.

               Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, 
               whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all 
               around him. He crawls through the front gate.

               O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He 
               cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off 
               their mounts.

               Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY 
               amongst the rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as 
               the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind 
               him. O'Connell's guns go empty.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Son-of-a-bitch.

               He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate.

               Four Tuareg warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him.

               O'Connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running.

               He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway, trying to close the 
               heavy sandstone door.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey! Beni! Wait up!

               Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are ya doing?! Wait up!

               O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen 
               LEAP the big column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU 
                         CLOSE THAT DOOR!

               Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell 
               SLAMS his body into the door. It doesn't budge.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I'm gonna get you for this!

               He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his 
               life, weaving through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer 
               and closer. The POUNDING hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER.

               O'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. The 
               four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. The 
               vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off.

               O'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he 
               slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.

               And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them 
               REAR UP. Two of the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The 
               horses SCREECH and BELLOW and SNORT in fear, then buck like 
               fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared 
               them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their 
               mounts.

               O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right 
               hand and checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the 
               evil himself, and turns around. -- The shattered, decrepit 
               statue of Anubis stares back at him.

               Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet.

               He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming 
               sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing 
               beneath it, forming lines and shapes, -- drawing a picture.

               O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. The 
               sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the 
               sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.

               EXT. RIDGE - DAY

               Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble 
               clear of the decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence 
               and looks up. Very different from the Tuaregs, they have 
               BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS.

               The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this 
               time.

               The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with 
               dual scimitars across his waist. His face is both handsome 
               and horrible, blue and tattooed. Meet ARDETH RAY. His dark 
               eyes watch O'Connell stagger off into the open desert...

               EXT. CAIRO - DAY

               Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their 
               positions in the sky since it's birth. A city teeming with 
               every form of life. A strange, mysterious, wonderful city.

               WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN:

                                          CAIRO

               INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

               Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon 
               rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the 
               Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between 
               two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, 
               is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in- 
               a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare.

               This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with 
               her.

               Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows 
               the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books 
               whose titles all begin with the letter "O". Then she grabs 
               another book out from under her arm and reads the title.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up 
                         here?

               Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her 
               shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles 
               begin with the letter "T". Then she looks down. It's a long 
               way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down 
               on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
               across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too 
               far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder 
               with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.

               And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn 
               YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the 
               ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, 
               swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her 
               balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts 
               stiltwalking down the aisle.

                                     EVELYN
                         OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH!

               The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads 
               back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling 
               for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and 
               picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into 
               another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
               bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.

               And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES 
               into the next bookshelf.

               Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She 
               looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf 
               crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after 
               bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and 
               scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last 
               shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She 
               opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other 
               eye and stares at the huge mess.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oops.

               The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.

                                     CURATOR
                         Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! 
                         Give me frogs, flies, locusts, 
                         anything but this! Compared to you, 
                         the other plagues were a joy!

               Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm sorry, it was an accident.

                                     CURATOR
                         When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it 
                         was an accident. You are a 
                         catastrophe! Why do I put up with 
                         you?

               Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.

                                     EVELYN
                         You put up with me, because I can 
                         read and write ancient Egyptian, 
                         decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, 
                         and I'm the only person within a 
                         thousand miles who knows how to 
                         properly code and catalogue this 
                         library.

                                     CURATOR
                         Who needs smart women? I put up with 
                         you because your mother and father 
                         were our finest patrons, Allah rest 
                         their souls. Now straighten up this 
                         mess!

               The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming.

               And then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hello?

               Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly 
               shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.

                                     EVELYN
                         Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?

               Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters --

               INT. THE RAMESSEUM

               Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. 
               It's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from 
               FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery.

               The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly 
               shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch.

               Looks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they 
               stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She 
               walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases 
               of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this 
               one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks 
               around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans 
               forward with the torch, and peers inside.

               -- A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her!

               Evelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out 
               of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, 
               she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad 
               crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half 
               drunk.

                                     EVELYN
                         You...! YOU...!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please 
                         call me something original.

               Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, 
               Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.

                                     EVELYN
                         Have you no respect for the dead?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Right now, I only wish to join them.

               He grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather 
                         than later, before you ruin my career 
                         the way you've ruined yours.

                                     JONATHAN
                         My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll 
                         have you know, that at this moment 
                         my career is on a high note.

               He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.

                                     EVELYN
                         High note? Ha! For five years you've 
                         been scrounging around Egypt, and 
                         what have you to show for it? Nothing.

               Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh yes I do! I have something right 
                         here!

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh no, not another worthless trinket, 
                         Jonathan, if I bring one more piece 
                         of junk to the Curator to try and 
                         sell for you.

               Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY 
               to Imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly 
               curious, she grabs the box out of his hand.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where did you get this?

               Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.

                                     JONATHAN
                         On a dig, down in Thebes.

               Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself 
               as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it.

               Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation.

                                     JONATHAN
                         My whole life I've never found 
                         anything, Evy. Tell me I've found 
                         something.

               Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the 
               box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle 
               box. Then suddenly, it UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically, 
               turning itself into the KEY. Sitting inside the open key/box 
               is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An ANCIENT MAP.

                                     EVELYN
                         Jonathan?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes?

                                     EVELYN
                         I think you found something.

               INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's 
               eyepiece at the key/box. Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         See the cartouche there, it's the 
                         official royal seal of Seti the First, 
                         I'm sure of it.

                                     CURATOR
                         Perhaps.

               Jonathan leans in from across the desk.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Two questions. Who the hell is Seti 
                         the First? And was he rich?

                                     EVELYN
                         He was the last Pharaoh of the Old 
                         Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest 
                         Pharaoh of them all.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Alright, good, that's good. I like 
                         this fellow, like him very much.

               The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same 
               map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.

                                     EVELYN
                         I've already dated it, this map is 
                         almost four thousand years old. And 
                         the hieratics over here...
                              (Inhales deeply)
                         It's Hamunaptra.

               The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers.

                                     CURATOR
                         My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, 
                         we are scholars, not treasure hunters. 
                         Hamunaptra is a myth.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the 
                         early Pharaohs were said to have 
                         hidden the wealth of Egypt.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Right, right, in a big underground 
                         treasure chamber. Everybody knows 
                         the story. The entire necropolis was 
                         rigged to sink into the sand. On 
                         Pharaoh's command, a flick of the 
                         switch! And the whole place could 
                         disappear beneath the dunes.

                                     EVELYN
                         All we know is that the city 
                         mysteriously vanished around 2,134 
                         B.C.

               The Curator holds the map closer to the burning CANDLE-LAMP.

                                     CURATOR
                         As the Americans would say: it's all 
                         fairy tales and hokum.

               The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws 
               it to the floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly 
               puts it out. Lifts it up. The left third of the map is now 
               missing.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You burned it! You burned off the 
                         part with the lost city!

                                     CURATOR
                         It's for the best, I'm sure. Many 
                         men have wasted their lives in the 
                         foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no 
                         one has ever found it, most have 
                         never returned.

                                     JONATHAN
                              (devastated)
                         You killed my map.

                                     CURATOR
                         I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm 
                         surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to 
                         be so fooled.

               The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches 
               it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.

               EXT. CAIRO PRISON - GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

               Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every 
               low-life form of scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a 
               first rate scumbag himself, escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across 
               the gallows courtyard. Evelyn whispers to Jonathan.

                                     EVELYN
                         You told me you found it on a dig 
                         down in Thebes!

                                     JONATHAN
                         I was mistaken.

                                     EVELYN
                         You lied to me!

                                     JONATHAN
                         I lie to everybody, what makes you 
                         so special?

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That just makes you more gullible.

                                     EVELYN
                         You stole it from a drunk at the 
                         local Casbah?!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Picked his pocket, actually.

               EXT. VISITOR'S PEN - DAY

               The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.

                                     EVELYN
                         And what is he in prison for?

                                     WARDEN
                         I did not know, so when I heard you 
                         were coming, I asked him that myself.

                                     EVELYN
                         And what did he say?

                                     WARDEN
                         He said... he was just looking for a 
                         good time.

               The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, 
               dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars.

               From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is 
               half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new 
               bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.

                                     EVELYN
                         But he's just a filthy criminal?

                                     JONATHAN
                              (cringing)
                         Way to go, Evy.

               O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So who's the broad?

                                     EVELYN
                         Broad?!

                                     JONATHAN
                         She's my sister, actually.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a 
                         total loss.

               Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.

                                     WARDEN
                         I'll be back in a moment.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (sarcastic)
                         I tremble with anticipation.

               A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face 
               bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks 
               back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         We uh,... found... your puzzle box, 
                         and we've come to ask you about it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No.

                                     EVELYN
                         No?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No... You came to ask me about 
                         Hamunaptra.

               Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards 
               didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.

                                     EVELYN
                         How do you know the box pertains to 
                         Hamunaptra?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Because that's where I found it. I 
                         was there.

               Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious

                                     JONATHAN
                         How do we know that's not a load of 
                         pig swallow?

               O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey,... don't I know you?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Um, well, you see...

               O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan 
               square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A 
               Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again.

               He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look.

               Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         You were actually at Hamunaptra?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I just decked your brother

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, well...
                              (shrugs)
                         I know my brother.

               O'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, I was there.

                                     EVELYN
                         You swear?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Every damn day.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, I mean --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         -- I know what you mean. I was there, 
                         alright. Seti's place. The City Of 
                         The Dead.

                                     EVELYN
                         What did you find? What did you see?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I found sand. I saw death.

               The warden enters. Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         Could you tell me how to get there? 
                         The exact location?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Want to know?

               Evelyn leans in even closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Really want to know?

               She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

               O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then get me the hell outta here.

               Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off 
               the bars again, but before he can react the Guards GRAB him, 
               YANKS him away from the bars and DRAG him out of the room.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where are they taking him?

                                     WARDEN
                         To be hanged.

               Evelyn is shocked. The warden shows-off his green teeth.

                                     WARDEN
                         Apparently, he had a very good time.

               EXT. GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

               Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as 
               the hangman's noose is draped over O'Connell's head and 
               cinched tight around his neck. Evelyn follows the warden 
               onto a balcony above the gallows. The prisoners all go dead 
               quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh 
               meat.

                                     WARDEN
                         No women allowed.

                                     EVELYN
                         I am an English woman.

               This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.

               O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden.

                                     EVELYN
                         I will give you one hundred pounds 
                         to spare his life.

                                     WARDEN
                         I would pay one hundred pounds just 
                         to see him hang.

                                     EVELYN
                         Two hundred pounds.

                                     WARDEN
                         Proceed!

                                     EVELYN
                         Three hundred pounds!

               O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than 
               Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him.

                                     HANGMAN
                         Any last requests, pig?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.

               The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.

                                     EVELYN
                         FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!

               The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg.

                                     WARDEN
                         And what else?

               Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.

               Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the 
               Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.

                                     EVELYN
                         NOOO!

               O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays out. Then 
               JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope.

               But he's still alive, because --

                                     WARDEN
                         His neck did not break! Good! Now we 
                         watch him strangle to death.

               The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger.

               The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the 
               end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly 
               turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.

                                     EVELYN
                         He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

               The warden spins around and faces her.

                                     WARDEN
                         You lie.

                                     EVELYN
                         I would never!

               At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and 
               turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.

                                     WARDEN
                         Are you saying this filthy godless 
                         son of a pig knows where to find The 
                         City Of The Dead? Truly?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes and if you cut him down, we will 
                         give you ten percent.

                                     WARDEN
                         Fifty percent.

                                     EVELYN
                         Twenty.

                                     WARDEN
                         Forty.

               Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as 
               he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Give... give him... give him GLAAAA--
                         !

                                     EVELYN
                         Twenty-five percent, and not one 
                         single farthing more.

               The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic. 
               A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES 
               to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.

               All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up 
               at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.

               CURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face.

                                     CURATOR
                         She must die.

               Standing in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA: 
               blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works. One 
               of the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs.

                                     HOOK
                         She is like all the others. She will 
                         die in the desert.

                                     CURATOR
                         No! She has seen too much. She knows 
                         too much.

               The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.

                                     CURATOR
                         Not only does she have a map, but 
                         she has the key.

               Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys.

                                     HOOK
                         The key!? She has the lost key!?

                                     CURATOR
                         Yes. No one has ever had so much, 
                         been so close. We must stop her, or 
                         it will be the end of us all.

                                     HOOK
                         Then we will kill her, we will kill 
                         her and all those with her.

                                     CURATOR
                         And burn the map and retrieve the 
                         key.

                                     HOOK
                         It will be done. But what of the 
                         American expedition? They leave 
                         tomorrow as well.

                                     CURATOR
                         Forget the bumbling Americans, they 
                         will be like all the others. Without 
                         the map to guide them, how can they 
                         possibly find Hamunaptra?

               EXT. GIZA PORT - DAY

               SMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI.

                                     BENI
                         It is three days down the Nile, then 
                         two days by camel, sahibs.

               WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a 
               PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS.

                                     DANIELS
                         For all the money we're paying you, 
                         something better god-damned well be 
                         under that sand.

               WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back.

                                     HENDERSON
                         "Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya 
                         gotta keep sayin, to yourself, 
                         "Hamunaptra."

               Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the 
               docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn 
               and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS 
               selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do you really think he'll show up?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he 
                         may be a cowboy, but his word is his 
                         word.

                                     EVELYN
                         Personally, I think he's filthy, 
                         rude and a complete scoundrel. I 
                         don't like him one bit.

                                     O'CONNELL (O.S.)
                         Anyone I know?

               They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit 
               and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more 
               dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh... um,... hello.

               Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Smashing day for the start of an 
                         adventure, eh, O'Connell?

               O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, sure, smashing.

               He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the 
               bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.

                                     BURNS
                         You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?

                                     BENI
                         Along with the scorched bones of my 
                         entire garrison, sahib.

               And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head, 
               as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the 
               men.

                                     BENI
                         A thousand pardons, my good sahibs 
                         but there is much work to be done.

               Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.

               BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mister O'Connell, can you look me in 
                         the eye, and guarantee me this is 
                         not some sort of flimflam? Because 
                         if it is, I'm warning you --

               O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks 
               her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         All I can tell you, miss, is that my 
                         Colonel found that map in an ancient 
                         fortress, and the whole damn garrison 
                         believed in it so much, that without 
                         orders, we marched halfway across 
                         Libya and into Egypt to find that 
                         city. Like I told ya, all I saw was 
                         sand. Everybody else was wiped out 
                         by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your 
                         bags.

               O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
               the same passenger barge that Beni and the Americans are on.

               Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, 
                         a complete scoundrel, nothing to 
                         like there at all.

               Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's 
               when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy 
               hat.

                                     WARDEN
                         A bright good morning to all.

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you doing here?

                                     WARDEN
                         I have come to protect my investment, 
                         thank you very much.

               And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.

               WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
               Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into --

               EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT

               The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS MUMIA 
               quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The one 
               with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two 
               row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.

               EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT

               Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell 
               comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we 
                         could use another good player.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I only gamble with my life, never my 
                         money.

                                     DANIELS
                         Never? What if I were to wager five 
                         hundred dollars says we get to 
                         Hamunaptra before you?

               O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yer on.

               Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.

                                     BURNS
                         What makes you so confident, sir?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What makes you?

               Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.

                                     HENDERSON
                         We got us a man who's actually been 
                         there.

               O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, what a coincidence, why --

               O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the 
               gunnysack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.

                                     JONATHAN
                         -- whose deal is it? Is it my deal? 
                         I thought I just dealt?

               EXT. BARGE - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.

               The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

                                     EVELYN
                         The only thing that scares me, Mister 
                         O'Connell, are your manners.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         If you call that a kiss.

               O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out 
               revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, 
               and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.

                                     EVELYN
                         Did I miss something? Are we going 
                         into battle?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The last time I was at that place 
                         everybody I was with died.

               This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts 
               dismantling and cleaning the guns.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There's something out there, you 
                         know, something under that sand.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain 
                         artifact, a book, actually, my brother 
                         thinks there's treasure. What do you 
                         think is out there?

               O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin 
                         believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, 
                         they call it, "the doorway to hell."

                                     EVELYN
                         Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to 
                         the underworld", actually.

               She gives him a know-it-all grin.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't believe in fairy tales and 
                         hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do 
                         believe that one of the most famous 
                         books in history is buried out there, 
                         The Book Of The Living. It's what 
                         first interested me in Egypt as a 
                         child. It's why I came here, sort of 
                         a life's pursuit.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And the fact that they say it's made 
                         out of pure gold, makes no nevermind 
                         to you, right?

               Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.

                                     EVELYN
                         You know your history.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I know my treasure.

               Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns 
               back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:

                                     EVELYN
                         By the way,... why did you kiss me?

               O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I was about to be hanged, seemed 
                         like a good idea at the time.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.

               O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?... Wha'd I say?

               Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly 
               reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.

                                     BENI
                         My very good friend! What a surprise.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Why if it ain't my little buddy, 
                         Beni. I oughta kill you.

               O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows 
               hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.

                                     BENI
                         You never were any good with the 
                         ladies, O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So you're the one leading the 
                         Americans, I shoulda figured. So 
                         what's the scam? You get 'em out in 
                         the middle of the desert then leave 
                         'em to rot?

                                     BENI
                         Unfortunately no, these Americans 
                         are smart, they pay me only half 
                         now, half when I get them back to 
                         Cairo, so I must go all the way.

               O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.

                                     BENI
                         You never believed in Hamunaptra, 
                         O'Connell. Why are you going back? 
                         The devil himself lives out there.

               They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the 
               HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and 
               backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The girl saved my life, figured it 
                         was the least I could do, keep her 
                         out of trouble.

                                     BENI
                         You always did have more balls than 
                         brains.

               O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Let's make us even, shall we?

                                     BENI
                         Even?

               O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge.

               Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his gunny-sack 
               and starts walking off down the deck.

                                     BENI (O.S.)
                         O'Connell! I am going to kill you 
                         for this!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sounds familiar.

               And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming 
               up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.

               O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.

               INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror.

               She gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose 
               over her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT THERE 
               IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his hand 
               over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.

                                     HOOK
                         Where is the map?

               Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees 
               the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.

                                     HOOK
                         And the key? Where is the key?

               Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins.

                                     HOOK
                         Then I'll find it myself.

               He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.

               Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.

               O'Connell looks at her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Friend of yours?

               Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table 
               FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell 
               spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.

               FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's 
               head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.

               FIRING BLINDLY. A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene 
               SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs 
               the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder, 
               right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.

               O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.

               HALLWAY - NIGHT

               O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.

                                     EVELYN
                         The map! We need the map!

               He shoves her up against a wall.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Relax! I'm the map!
                              (taps his forehead)
                         It's all up here.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh that's comforting.

               O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon, there's still one more of 
                         those guys around here somewhere.

               EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT

               Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye 
               and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on 
               the floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks 
               him into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.

                                     JONATHAN
                         EVY!!

               Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up. A 
               HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine --

               It's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.

               Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.

               EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse 
               paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.

               BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.

               O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the 
               other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.

               Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the 
               paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their 
               heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The 
               Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep 
               up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now 
               ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Can you swim?

                                     EVELYN
                         Well of course I can swim, if the 
                         occasion calls for it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Trust me.

               He picks her up and throws her over the side.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The occasion calls for it.

               Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after 
               her.

               EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT

               Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans, 
               guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything 
               in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Americans.

               Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH.

               Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his 
               FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes 
               widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to 
               strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook 
               over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say! Good show!

               Then he points his thumb at himself

                                     JONATHAN
                         And did I panic?

               He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I think not.

               And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan 
               dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.

               NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the 
               water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she 
               wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices.

               Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the 
               far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.

                                     BENI
                         Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I 
                         got all the horses!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on 
                         the wrong side of the river!

               Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand 
               CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking...

               BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY

               O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading 
               post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them 
               the reins of four ugly old camels.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I can't believe the price of these 
                         fleabags.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We coulda had 'em for free, all we 
                         had to do was give 'em your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Awfully.

               And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's 
               changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then again...

               SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in 
               the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Never did like camels. Filthy buggers. 
                         They smell, they bite, they spit. 
                         Disgusting.

               The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile 
               green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his 
               gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, disgusting.

               Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well I think they're cute.

               WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the 
               desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.

               FRYING PAN - NIGHT

               The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking 
               across the vast wasteland.

               Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the 
               rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden 
               SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to 
               slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her, 
               then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking 
               her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he 
               looks up at a distant ridge --

               -- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing 
               them.

               EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY

               The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as 
               Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And you snore!

                                     WARDEN
                         I do not snore!

                                     JONATHAN
                         All night you snored!

                                     WARDEN
                         I have never snored!

               Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We're almost there.

                                     EVELYN
                         Are you sure?

               O'Connell looks down at the ground.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Pretty sure.

               The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking 
               out of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the 
               skeletons look like they're trying to crawl up out of the 
               desert floor.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What in bloody hell is this?

               The Warden shivers in fear.

                                     WARDEN
                         Other seekers of Hamunaptra.

               The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of 
               the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE 
               DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel, 
               the rest ride horses.

                                     BENI
                         Good morning, my friend!

               O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred 
               feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless 
               horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.

                                     DANIELS
                         Well, what the hell we doin'?

                                     BENI
                         Patience, my good sahib, patience.

               Henderson looks over at O'Connell.

                                     HENDERSON
                         First one to the city, O'Connell! 
                         Five hundred! Cash bucks!

               O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.

               Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts 
               to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Get ready.

               Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.

                                     EVELYN
                         For what?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We're about to be shown the way.

               Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the 
               sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.

               Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then --

                                     DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS
                         HEYA!

               The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.

                                     DANIELS
                         SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!

               Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't 
                         we be going?

                                     EVELYN
                         After all, you rode us night and day 
                         to win that bet.

               O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard. Beni watches the 
               Americans and spits into the sand.

                                     BENI
                         Fools.

               And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.

               Passing across the sun as it goes. It's a MIRAGE.

               The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other 
               way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.

               The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.

               The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the 
               volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell 
               and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And 
               the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from 
               his horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it 
               to the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.

               The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.

               The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.

               And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.

               And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else 
               hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.

               And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.

               Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell. 
               Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!

               But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni 
               off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.

               Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never 
               felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this 
               girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of 
               the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past 
               him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn! Slow down!

               Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN! THERE'S 
                         A REALLY BIG --

               INT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands 
               in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.

               O'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Never mind.

               The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside 
               the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You boys owe me five hundred dollars.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy 
               hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three 
               Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats 
               flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty 
               backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps.

                                     DANIELS
                         Where'd all these camels come from?

                                     BENI
                         They belong to the dead. They will 
                         wait years for their masters to return 
                         before leaving.

               EXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next 
               to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.

               O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of 
               the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan 
               bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS 
               and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That thing gives me the creeps.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Be nice. That thing saved my life.

               Evelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice.

                                     EVELYN
                         That "thing" gets me excited.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (sarcastic)
                         The things that get you excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to Bembridge Scholars, 
                         inside the statue of Anubis was a 
                         secret compartment, perhaps containing 
                         The Book Of The Living.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are those mirrors for?

                                     EVELYN
                         Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

               O'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice.

               INT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden 
               drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do you realize, we are standing inside 
                         a room that no one has entered in 
                         over four thousand years.

                                     WARDEN
                         Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You're welcome to my share of the 
                         spider webs.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And it stinks to high heaven in here.

               Evelyn just rolls her eyes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Cretins.

               Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden 
               and realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops 
               sniffing.

               Evelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall, 
               then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF 
               LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. -- THE RAY OF LIGHT 
               HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE 
               DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT 
               RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's 
               chamber.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That is a neat trick.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, It's a preparation room.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Preparation for what?

                                     EVELYN
                         For entering the afterlife.

               O'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Mummies, my good son, this is where 
                         they made the mummies.

               Evelyn heads down a narrow passageway. The others follow.

               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way 
               through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat 
               warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and 
               freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls.

               They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker 
               and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and 
               louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan 
               licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him.

               ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               They slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of 
               an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis.

               Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the 
               other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn 
               behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER!

               O'Connell LEAPS OUT. -- THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT 
               HIM. O'Connell REACTS. But doesn't pull the trigger because 
               it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Ya scared the bejeezus out of us, 
                         O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Likewise.

               But nobody lowers their guns. Daniels grins, the tough one.

                                     DANIELS
                         This here is our statue,... friend.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't see your name on it,... pal.

               And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step 
               out of the shadows, -- all holding guns aimed at O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are 
                         no-so-good.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I've had worse.

               Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, me too.

               O'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun, 
               grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then 
               Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down.

                                     EVELYN
                         Let's be nice, children, if we're 
                         going to play together, we must learn 
                         to share.

               Evelyn pulls O'Connell away. Jonathan and the Warden follow.

               Beni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing.

               The Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the 
               ceiling. Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to my calculations, we 
                         should be right under the statue. 
                         We'll come up right between his legs.
                              (she blushes and laughs)
                         Oh my.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And when those dirty Yanks go to 
                         sleep --
                              (looks at O'Connell)
                         No offense.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         None taken.

                                     JONATHAN
                         We'll sneak up and steal that book 
                         right out from under them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And you're sure you can find the 
                         secret compartment?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't 
                         already found it.

               Jonathan looks around.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, what's our smelly little friend 
                         got himself up to?

               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

               The Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH.

               A mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of 
               black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred 
               beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and 
               starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's 
               found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist 
               brushes sand away from the seam. Henderson steps forward and 
               grabs the seam, -- the Egyptologist quickly stops him.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         Seti was no fool.

               Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, sure...

               He looks back at the native Diggers.

                                     HENDERSON
                         We'll let him open it.

               The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers.

               The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out 
               his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers 
               hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into 
               the seams. The other Diggers back away, scared shitless.

               Beni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back 
               away as well.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Lemme get this straight, they stuck 
                         a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, 
                         cut your brain into small pieces, 
                         then ripped it all out through your 
                         nostrils?

                                     JONATHAN
                         OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

                                     EVELYN
                         It's called mummification. You're 
                         dead when they do this

                                     JONATHAN
                         Still...

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

                                     EVELYN
                         You two are worse than a couple of 
                         schoolboys.

               And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.

               O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES 
               for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE 
               CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER

               Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their 
               guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less, 
               he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS --

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         FENI!

               The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give, 
               The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The 
               compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers 
               give one final pull and --

               -- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS 
               THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM.

               Dying horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the 
               ground...

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan 
               slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.

               We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks 
                         like a sarcophagus.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Why would they bury somebody in the 
                         ceiling?

                                     EVELYN
                         They didn't, they buried him at the 
                         foot of Anubis. He was either someone 
                         of great importance. Or he did 
                         something very naughty.

               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

               The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then 
               greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops 
               it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly 
               falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.

               CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.

               The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to 
               WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.

               Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE 
               scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly 
               burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.

               The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his 
               knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, 
               higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
               large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS 
               IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The 
               Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The 
               lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and 
               COUGHING.

               And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, 
               revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it 
               Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well?... Who is it?

               Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.

                                     EVELYN
                         'He that shall not be named.'

               O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There's some sort of lock here. You 
                         say these thing's are made of granite 
                         with a steel interior?

                                     EVELYN
                         Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting 
                         out.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No kiddin', without a key, it'll 
                         take us a month to crack this thing,

                                     EVELYN
                         A key! That's it! That's what he was 
                         talking about.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Who was talking about what?

               Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.

                                     EVELYN
                         The man on the barge. The one with 
                         the hook, he was looking for a key.

               Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine!

               Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's 
               now shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles.

               And that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through 
               the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.

               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the 
               labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden 
               starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, 
               he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the 
               labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The 
               Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring, 
               breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves...

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.

                                     EVELYN
                         What do you suppose killed him?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you ever see him eat?

               O'Connell comes up over some rocks.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Seems the Americans had a little 
                         misadventure of their own today, 
                         three of their diggers were killed.

                                     EVELYN
                         How?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. 
                         Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Maybe this place really is cursed.

               A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp.

               The campfire FLICKERS O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous 
               look. Evelyn laughs.

                                     EVELYN
                         You two!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You don't believe in curses, huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I believe if I can see it and I 
                         can touch it, then it's real. That's 
                         what I believe.

               O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I believe in being prepared.

               Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the 
               scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY 
               PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, --
               Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the 
               pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.

                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN
                         WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!

               Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch 
               and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Seagrams!

               Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside 
               out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well, he may have been a stinky 
                         fellow,... but he had good taste.

               Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily 
               And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear 
               to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then 
               a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.

               O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Stay here!

               He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately 
               gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the 
               bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man 
                         just say -- !

               EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT

               The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS 
               gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as 
               they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill 
               multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps 
               SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.

               O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, 
               who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Goin' somewhere?

                                     BENI
                         Just looking for you, O'Connell! I 
                         wanted to be with my friend!

               O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon, friend.

                                     BENI
                              (struggling)
                         Why do you like to fight so much?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         'Cause I look good doin, it.

               Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down 
               with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, 
               LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to 
               the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point 
               blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell 
               is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.

               A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, 
               misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider 
               off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone.

               Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, 
               she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.

               A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly 
               backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises 
               his scimitar, about to strike.

               Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant 
               gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS 
               him twenty feet back into some ruins.

               At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and 
               over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand 
               dune.

               Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the 
               temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.

               Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Let 'em have it, boys!

               Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, 
               the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, bloody good show.

               And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land 
               behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around 
               and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.

               O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something 
               THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray 
               on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises 
               his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!

               Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, 
               O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick 
               of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It 
               IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two 
               men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray 
               points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE 
                         OR DIE!

               Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after 
               him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, 
               then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn 
               staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her 
               and holds her close.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You alright?

               Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time 
               he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's 
               also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes,... fine,... thank you.

               Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and 
               Burns help Daniels to his feet.

                                     DANIELS
                         See! That proves it! Old Seti's 
                         fortune's gotta be under this sand!

                                     HENDERSON
                         For them to protect it like this, 
                         you just know there's got to be 
                         treasure down there.

               O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         These men are a desert people. They 
                         value water, not gold.

               Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where's Jonathan?

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.

               Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close 
               and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.

               O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, 
               the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the 
               bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly --

                                     EVELYN
                         Unlike my brother, sir, I know when 
                         to say no.

               O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Unlike your brother, Miss, you I 
                         don't get. You're a whole new brew.

                                     EVELYN
                         I know, you're wondering, what's a 
                         place like me doing in a girl like 
                         this?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Something like that.

                                     EVELYN
                         Egypt is in my blood. My father was 
                         a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so 
                         much that he married an Egyptian. My 
                         mother! Who was quite an adventurer 
                         herself

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, I get your father, I get your 
                         mother and I get your brother, but 
                         what are you doing here?

               Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.

                                     EVELYN
                         I may not be an explorer, or an 
                         adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or 
                         a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But 
                         I'm proud of what I am.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And what is that?

               Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins 
               and proudly lifts her head high.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...I am a librarian!

               She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm going to kiss you, Mister 
                         O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No you're not.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm not?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Not unless you call me Rick.

                                     EVELYN
                         Why would I do that?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Because that's my name.

               She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES 
               HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, 
               slumping into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and 
               just smiles.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and 
               turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are 
               heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.

               They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.

               PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.

                                     EVELYN
                         I can't believe I allowed the two of 
                         you to get me drunk.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Don't blame me, I don't even remember 
                         being there.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well neither do I, thank you.

               O'Connell gives her a hurt look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You don't?

               Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look.

                                     EVELYN
                         No... Why?... Should I?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Gee, yeah, you told me it was the 
                         best time you ever had.

               O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops, 
               appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF 
               and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly 
               grab their sore heads and MOAN.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the 
               secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them.

               Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out 
               the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor.

               Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         There is a curse upon this chest.

                                     DANIELS
                         Curse my ass.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, who cares.

               The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         In these hallowed grounds, that which 
                         was set forth in ancient times, is 
                         as strong today, as it was then.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --

               The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         "Death will come on swift wings to 
                         whomever opens this chest".

               A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER 
               All the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING.

               The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         It says, there is one, the undead, 
                         who if brought back to life, is bound 
                         by sacred law to consummate this 
                         curse.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, well, let's just make sure we 
                         don't bring anybody back from the 
                         dead then, huh?

               The three Americans laugh.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         He will kill all who open this 
                         chest,... and assimilate their organs 
                         and fluids.

                                     DANIELS
                         Assimilate their organs and fluids? 
                         Ya mean eat 'em?

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         And in so doing he will regenerate. 
                         And no longer be the undead, but a 
                         plague upon this earth.

               The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and 
               the Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just 
               shrugs.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Ah hell, let's open it anyways.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               WHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next 
               to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, I've dreamed about this 
                         ever since I was a little girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You dream about dead guys?

               Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and 
               cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Look, all the sacred spells have 
                         been chiseled off. The hieratics and 
                         hieroglyphs that protect the deceased 
                         on his journey into the afterlife, 
                         they've been removed. This man was 
                         cursed,... doomed.

               O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Tough break.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see 
                         who's inside, shall we?

               Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box 
               into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a 
               HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs

               the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan 
               helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly.

               And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT 
               INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP!

                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN
                         AHHHHH!!!

               They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the 
               'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years 
               have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden 
               chest. Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background, 
               Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.

                                     BENI
                         The curse,... beware the curse!

               Beni turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits.

                                     DANIELS
                         Stupid superstitious bastard.

               And that's when the seal breaks, -- A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT 
               OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and 
               carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Is he supposed to look like that?

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I've never seen a mummy look 
                         like this. He's, he's still...

                                     JONATHAN
                         Juicy?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. He's more than four thousand 
                         years old and still decomposing.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And look at this.

               O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there 
               are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, he was buried alive.

               This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         And he left a message.

               WE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD.

                                     EVELYN
                         It says: 'Death is only the 
                         beginning.'

               Jonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Where's my gun?

                                     JONATHAN
                         What are you going to do? Shoot him?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         If he decides to wake up, hell yes!

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed 
               at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches 
               inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes 
               widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and 
               slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book 
               Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to 
               life.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         I have heard told of this book, but 
                         I never truly believed it existed. 
                         This, good gentlemen, is a most 
                         priceless treasure.

               Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger.

                                     HENDERSON
                         I wouldn't trade ya for a brass 
                         spittoon!

                                     DANIELS
                         Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta 
                         pure gold!

               Daniels kicks the chest. It breaks open, unfolding to reveal 
               a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL 
               ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels)

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni 
               are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan 
               wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What is this stuff? It smells like 
                         our late friend, the Warden.

               O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You did not!?... We're not!?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Rat gizzards. They smell bad and 
                         taste worse, but that's the best the 
                         desert has to offer.

               The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Say O'Connell, whadaya think these 
                         honey's'll fetch back home?

                                     BURNS
                         We hear you gentlemen found yerselves 
                         a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.

                                     DANIELS
                         Ya know if ya dry him out, you can 
                         sell him for firewood.

               The Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a 
               pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground.

                                     EVELYN
                         Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them 
                         inside our friend's coffin. They can 
                         stay alive for years living off the 
                         flesh of a corpse, or in this case...

               She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat

                                     EVELYN
                         Famished.

               O'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Are you saying somebody threw these 
                         things in with our guy, and they 
                         slowly ate him alive?

                                     EVELYN
                         Very slowly.

                                     JONATHAN
                         He certainly was not a popular fellow 
                         when they planted him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Must of got a little too frisky with 
                         the Pharaoh's daughter.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to my readings, our friend 
                         suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of 
                         all ancient Egyptian curses, one 
                         reserved for only the most evil 
                         blasphemers. In all of my research, 
                         I've never read of this curse actually 
                         having been performed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That bad huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, they never used it because they 
                         feared it so. It's written, that if 
                         a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever 
                         arise, he would bring with him the 
                         ten plagues of Egypt.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The ten plagues?... You mean all ten 
                         plagues.

                                     BENI
                         Like what that Moses guy did to that 
                         Pharaoh guy?

                                     EVELYN
                         That's one way of putting it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Let's see, there was frogs, flies, 
                         locusts...

                                     BURNS
                         Hail and fire.

                                     HENDERSON
                         The sun turning black.

                                     DANIELS
                         Water turning to blood.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And my personal favorite: people 
                         covered in boils and sores.

               All the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just 
               laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.

                                     EVELYN
                         Fried gizzard anyone?

               EXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple 
               and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the 
               Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, 
               the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn 
               stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks 
               over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.

               Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over 
               and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You sure you outta be playin, around 
                         with that?

                                     EVELYN
                         It's just a book, no harm ever came 
                         from a book.

               Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell 
               share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.

                                     EVELYN
                         Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.

               Evelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Evelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's 
               chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN 
               over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards 
               Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills 
               FRAME, -- and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN!

               Revealing EMPTY SOCKETS. -- BIG SCARY MUSIC STING.

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around, 
               sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!

               He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard, 
               coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all 
               leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.

               The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the 
               darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops 
               everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their 
               side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid 
               vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.

               The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The 
               Book Of The Dead, looking haunted.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         What have we done?

               The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR

               INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth, 
               slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! 
                         Billions of grasshoppers!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That's one of the plagues, right? 
                         The grasshopper plague!

                                     EVELYN
                         This is not a plague. It's 
                         generational. Every so many years 
                         the locusts of Egypt have a population 
                         explosion and they all take flight.

               Evelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers 
               his TORCH, -- the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay,... and what about frogs?

               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway.

               Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the ground, 
               they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to his feet, 
               squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness,

                                     BURNS
                         Daniels! Henderson!

               INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to 
               SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, -- HUNDREDS OF 
               CHITTERING SCARAB BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start 
               scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS.

               Even O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul 
               ass.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out 
               in front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything.

               Then ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps 
               out.

                                     BURNS
                         Daniels?... is that you?

               Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move.

                                     BURNS
                         Henderson?

               Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands 
               reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEP'S PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns 
               jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at 
               them, -- HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts 
               to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth.

               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase, just 
               ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS.

               O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next 
               to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of 
               the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs 
               scurries between them, their ear-piercing CHITTERS send 
               shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.

               Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then 
               they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.

                                     JONATHAN
                         EVY!?

               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully 
               looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels 
               her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft 
               of MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A 
               MAN stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards 
               him.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh thank goodness, you're one of the 
                         Americans, aren't you?

               Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF 
               HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating, 
               she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around 
               It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is 
               down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, 
               her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun?

               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Damn-it! Must be a trap door around 
                         here or somethin'.

               And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson, 
               Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.

                                     HENDERSON
                         RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!

               O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of 
               CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly 
               trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and 
               help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as 
               the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through 
               him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels 
               Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already 
               running, races right past them. The others turn and haul 
               ass.

               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Imhotep steps forward, -- the sand around him seems to 
               MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal 
               legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns

                                     EVELYN
                         Help me,... please,... help me.

               Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because 
               HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the 
               ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a 
               big game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his 
               fetid lips, -- A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!

               Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying 
               around the corner and runs right up to her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Would you quit playin, around! Let's 
                         get outta here already!

               O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, -- at 
               the sight of Imhotep, O'Connell jumps back in fright.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         WHOA!

               O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.

               Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering 
               his prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts 
               to crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops 
               and UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches 
               to an inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial 
               SHRIEK.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

               Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his 
               fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Ahhhhhhhh!!

               Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the 
               SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his 
               ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.

               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

               SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn 
               stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN 
               ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson, 
               Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees, 
               hands over their heads. Ardeth Ray steps forward.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         I told you to leave or die, you 
                         refused, and now you may have killed 
                         us all. For you have unleashed the 
                         creature that we have feared for 
                         more than four thousand years.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Relax, I got him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         No mortal weapons can kill this 
                         creature. He is not of this world.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Are we talkin, about the same 
                         creature? The walking corpse? Really 
                         big mouth? Really bad breath?

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Beni slowly backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He 
               turns around, -- IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs 
               away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but 
               have no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the 
               back wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless.

               Imhotep moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten 
               mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his 
               side. Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his 
               neck, RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain.

               Beni holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly 
               makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:

                                     BENI
                         May the good Lord protect and watch 
                         over me as a shepherd watches over 
                         his flock. And may Satan in all his 
                         forms be vanquished forever.

               It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni 
               quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them 
               out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his 
               progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a 
               Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.

               All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and 
               Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for 
               Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.

               And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses 
               himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand 
               lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (subtitled)
                         The language of the slaves.

               Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (in Hebrew -- subtitled)
                         I may have use for you. And the 
                         rewards will be great.

               Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out 
               his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes, 
               about to throw up, but then the maggots part, -- revealing a 
               tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises 
               his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Where are the other sacred jars?

               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

               Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant 
               sockets. Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified.

                                     DANIELS
                         You bastards!

                                     HENDERSON
                         What did you do to him!?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         We saved him! Saved him before the 
                         creature could finish his work. Now 
                         leave, all of you, quickly, before 
                         he finishes you all.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You're not going to kill us?

               Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         We must now hunt him down, and try 
                         and find a way to kill him, before 
                         he consumes the earth. Allah be with 
                         us.

               Ardeth Ray and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice.

               O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I told ya, I already got him!

               Ardeth Ray stops and looks back, deadly serious.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Know this, the creature will be coming 
                         for you. He must consummate the curse. 
                         And until he does, he will never 
                         eat, he will never sleep, and he 
                         will never stop.

               Ardeth Ray turns and jumps down into the crevice,

               EXT. RUINS - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels 
               and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist, 
               still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another.

               They all head off into the dark, windblown desert...

               And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY 
               PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC, 
               PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE --

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY

               A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front 
               gate. Our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty 
               camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter.

               INT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY

               A steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open.

               O'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I thought you didn't believe in this 
                         stuff!?

               O'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses

                                     EVELYN
                         Having an encounter with a four 
                         thousand year old walking-talking 
                         corpse tends to convert one.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Forget it, we're out the door down 
                         the hall and gone.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, we are not.

               O'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh yes we are.

               O'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues 
               to UNPACK them:

                                     EVELYN
                         No we are not. We woke him up, and 
                         we must try and stop him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We?! What we?! You didn't read that 
                         book. I told you not to play around 
                         with that thing.

                                     EVELYN
                         Alright then, Me, I,... I read the 
                         book, I woke him up and I intend to 
                         stop him.

               O'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         How!? You heard the man, no mortal 
                         weapons can kill this guy.

               Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer.

                                     EVELYN
                         Then we'll have to find some immortal 
                         ones.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There goes that belief again. Not 
                         me, I am outta here!

               O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk.

               Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.

               O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking 
               his fingers as Evelyn follows him.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to that Book, once this 
                         creature has been reborn, his curse 
                         will spread, and as he grows in 
                         strength, so will his curse grow, 
                         infecting the people until the whole 
                         of the earth is destroyed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

                                     EVELYN
                              (incredulous)
                         It's everybody's problem!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Look lady, I appreciate you saving 
                         my life and all, but when I signed 
                         on, I agreed to take you out there 
                         and bring you back, and I did, now 
                         were even, end of job, end of story, 
                         contract terminated.

                                     EVELYN
                         That's what I am to you? A contract?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You can either tag along with me, or 
                         you can stay here and play around 
                         with Mister Maggot.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm staying.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FINE.

               O'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the 
               door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a 
               handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door.

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

               O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni 
               coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his 
               face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Beni ya little stinkweed, where did 
                         you slink off to?

                                     BENI
                         You left me! You left me in the desert 
                         to rot.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.
                              (gestures to Imhotep)
                         So who's this guy?

                                     BENI
                         This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest 
                         of Osiris.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

               O'Connell sticks out his hand, -- Imhotep instantly recoils 
               O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers.

                                     BENI
                         The Prince does not like to be touched 
                         by other humans. A Silly eastern 
                         superstition, I'm afraid.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, well, we all got our little 
                         problems today don't we?

                                     BENI
                         He has come to help Mister Burns. 
                         Somehow I feel responsible.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't gimme that, you never had any 
                         scruples.

                                     BENI
                         Do you know where I can steal some?

               O'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives 
               Imhotep a look as he strides off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         See ya around, Padre.

               Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.

               INT. CASBAH - DAY

               The proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and 
               hard liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a 
               walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers.

               He wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm the last of the Royal Force still 
                         stationed here, you know? All the 
                         other laddies died in the air and 
                         were buried in the sand.

               The tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to 
               O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.

                                     WINSTON
                         Ever since the end of the Great War, 
                         there hasn't been a single challenge 
                         worthy of a man like me.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I've heard it before, Winston.

               O'Connell shoves him away. Winston staggers back to Jonathan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I just wish I would've chucked it 
                         with the other laddies, gone down in 
                         a flame of glory, instead of sitting 
                         around here, rotting from boredom 
                         and booze!

               Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods 
               Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them.

               Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment.

                                     BURNS
                         The drawer there, spectacles.
                              (tries to laugh)
                         As you see, I won't be needing them.

               Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He 
               puts the bifocals on over his death mask, -- and grins 
               broadly, his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.

                                     BENI
                         Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks 
                         you for your spectacles, -- and for 
                         your eyes,... and for your tongue.

               The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.

                                     BENI
                         But I am afraid more is needed, the 
                         Prince says he must finish the job, 
                         consummate the curse which you and 
                         your friends have brought down upon 
                         yourselves.

               A look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly 
               backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the 
               sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing 
               his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL.

               INT. CASBAH - DAY

               Three shot glasses clink together. O'Connell, Jonathan and 
               Henderson slug 'em down, -- all three of them instantly SPIT 
               OUT the liquid. Half the bar SPITS OUT their drinks as well.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,... 
                         like...

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Blood.

               They all look at each other, even more nervous.

                                     JONATHAN
                         "And the rivers and waters of Egypt 
                         went red and were as blood."

               A look passes over O'Connell's face, a realization.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         He's here.

               He suddenly jumps away from the bar and runs for the door.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Who's here!?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

               LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound, 
               knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY

               Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of 
               books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops 
               half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and 
               drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We got problems.

               And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the 
               courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain 
               bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and 
               CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         He's here! I saw him! That thing is 
                         here!

                                     EVELYN
                         The creature!? Are you sure!?

               O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the 
               HAIL and FIRE.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Pretty sure!

               The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.

               O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM 
               is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.

               O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.

               INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY

               O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant 
               who is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they 
               spot Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, -- 
               HIS BODY IS SHRIVELED TO HALF IT'S SIZE.

               Drained of all organs and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are 
               shocked. Then they hear a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep 
               standing on the far side of the room. O'Connell draws his 
               gun.

               Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful 
               new musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and 
               REFORM. His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and 
               CRIES OUT, in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks 
               like an incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell.

               The 'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We are in serious trouble.

               Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Back off, creep.

               Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep 
               Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.

               Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're 
               all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.

               O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep 
               in the face, -- HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEP'S SKULL AND 
               GETS STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, 
               shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of 
               Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist 
               quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as 
               if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.

               Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort, 
               THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others 
               knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that 
               just grabbed O'Connell, -- IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.

               He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall, 
               terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         You saved me from the undead. For 
                         this, I shall make you immortal.

               He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face.

               And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins 
               into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed.

               Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.

                                     HENDERSON
                         The curse. The curse.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

               O'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn 
               across the Ramesseum.

                                     EVELYN
                         There's only one person I know who 
                         can possibly give us some answers.

               They round a corner and come upon the Curator, -- who is 
               talking with Ardeth Ray. Everybody stops.

                                     EVERYBODY
                         YOU!

               O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns. Ardeth 
               Ray just scowls. The Curator nods his head.

                                     CURATOR
                         Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.

                                     EVELYN
                         What is he doing here?

                                     CURATOR
                         Do you truly wish to know? Or would 
                         you prefer to just shoot us?

               Everybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I just saw my fist vanish into some 
                         guy's head.

               He slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I'm willin, to go on a little faith, 
                         here.

                                     CURATOR
                         You will not believe it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Try me.

               INT. RAMESSEUM - MOMENTS LATER

               Everyone is assembled around the tomb display of Seti The 
               First.

               We recognize his chariot and sword. The Curator sits on Seti's 
               throne.

                                     CURATOR
                         We are part of an ancient secret 
                         society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and 
                         we have a sacred mission, passed 
                         down through thirty-nine generations. 
                         For over four thousand years we have 
                         guarded The City Of The Dead. we are 
                         sworn at manhood to do any and all 
                         in our power to stop the High Priest 
                         Imhotep from being reborn into this 
                         world.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And because of you, we have failed.

                                     EVELYN
                              (appalled)
                         And you think this justifies killing 
                         innocent people!?

                                     CURATOR
                         To have stopped this creature? Yes!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's 
                         afraid of cats, what's that about?

                                     CURATOR
                         According to the ancients, cat's are 
                         the guardians at the gates of the 
                         underworld. Imhotep will fear them 
                         until he is fully regenerated, and 
                         then he will fear nothing.

               Daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at O'Connell.

                                     DANIELS
                         Right! And ya know how he gets fully 
                         regenerated?! By killing everybody 
                         who opened that chest and sucking us 
                         dry! That's how!

                                     CURATOR
                         Yes, the creature must first try and 
                         regenerate, and then he will attempt 
                         to resurrect the one he has loved 
                         for more than four thousand years.

                                     EVELYN
                         Anck-su-namun.

               The Curator and Ardeth Ray look at Evelyn, thunderstruck.

                                     EVELYN
                         In the necropolis, when I saw him, -
                         alive,... walking, he called me Anck-
                         su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' 
                         quarters he tried to kiss me.

                                     CURATOR
                         It is because it was you who read 
                         from the Book. He has chosen you to 
                         be the human sacrifice needed to 
                         regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

               Jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol.

                                     JONATHAN
                         This is not good. Not good at all.

               Ardeth Ray has been staring out a wall of windows.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Tonight is the full moon. The moon 
                         of Osiris. It will begin tonight.

               Everyone follows Ardeth Ray's eyes, through the windows we 
               can see the SUN, -- which is now going into a FULL ECLIPSE.

                                     JONATHAN
                         "...and he stretched forth his hands 
                         towards the heavens, and there was 
                         darkness throughout the land of 
                         Egypt."

               EXT. BRITISH FORT - WINDOW - DAY FOR NIGHT

               O'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning 
               the walls. Above and beyond them, -- is the BLACK SUN.

               EXT. EVELYN'S FOYER - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer

                                     EVELYN
                         We must stop him from regenerating.

               She turns to Daniels and Henderson.

                                     EVELYN
                         Who opened that chest?

                                     HENDERSON
                         Well, there was me and Daniels here 
                         and then poor Burns of course, oh 
                         yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.

               O'Connell turns from the window.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What about my buddy, Beni?

                                     DANIELS
                         Naw, he scrammed outta there,

                                     EVELYN
                         We must find the Egyptologist and 
                         bring him back here to the safety of 
                         the fort, before the creature can 
                         get to him.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you 
                         two come with me.

               All three of them pounce on him at once --

                                     HENDERSON
                         The hell with that! I'm not goin' 
                         nowhere! We're safe here.

                                     DANIELS
                         Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for 
                         nothin'.

                                     EVELYN
                         Who put you in charge? You can't 
                         just leave me behind like some old 
                         suitcase. I'm the one responsible 
                         for this mess and I intend to be the 
                         one to clean it up.

               O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon.

               Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the 
               door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room 
               we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.

               O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Keep an eye on her. If you leave her 
                         door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon, 
                         Jonathan.

               Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Me?

               CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

               The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking 
               haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and 
               his SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking 
               him. A STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed 
               face.

               He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers 
               his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading 
               into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO --

               THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files 
               and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket 
               watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he 
               starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.

                                     O'CONNELL (O.S.)
                         Well, well, well.

               Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Lemme guess, spring cleaning?

               Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a 
               chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into 
               a wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up 
               the wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Where's your new friend?

                                     BENI
                         What friend? You're my only friend.

               O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then you got no excuse for living. 
                         What the hell you doin, being buddies 
                         with this creep, Beni? What's in it 
                         for you?

                                     BENI
                         It is better to be the right hand of 
                         the Devil,... than in his path. As 
                         long as I serve him, I am immune.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Immune from what?

                                     BENI
                         You shall see.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are you looking for? Lie, and 
                         I'll slit your throat.

               O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin.

                                     BENI
                         The book! The black book they found 
                         at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. 
                         Said to me it would be worth it's 
                         weight in diamonds.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What does he want the book for?

                                     BENI
                              (shrugs)
                         Something about bringing his dead 
                         girly-friend back to life. He needs 
                         the book...
                              (looks at Jonathan)
                         And your sister.

               O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES 
               O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses.

               Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That looked rather painful.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (wincing)
                         Ya know, ever since I met you, my 
                         luck has been for crap.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, I know, I do that to people.

               And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming 
               from down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to 
               the window and look out --

               EXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing 
               away from the SHRIVELED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.

               A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred 
               canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's 
               Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and 
               catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; 
               his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a 
               huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight 
               up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.

               The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread 
               throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.

               EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Damn-it! That's two down and only 
                         two to go.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And then he'll be coming after Evy.

               They turn and race out of the office.

               BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT

               Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at 
               the front gate. More Soldiers march the encircling parapet.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Ten o'clock! All is well!

               The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below

               INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT

               Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair 
               next to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with 
               fear.

                                     DANIELS
                         The hell with this. I'm goin, 
                         downstairs to get me a drink. You 
                         want somethin'?

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a 
                         shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

               Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone, 
               smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his 
               SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes 
               in through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson 
               gets up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.

               The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS 
               Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.

               Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.

               His body TWISTS and TURNS and slowly SHRIVELS as the life is 
               SUCKED out of him.

               Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the wall above him, the 
               SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses, forming a SHADOW of a 
               human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the body REGENERATES.

               And then it's over.

               Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and 
               looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps 
               over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door, 
               rattles the knob. It's locked. Imhotep grins.

               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in 
               through the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large 
               mound. Evelyn starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO 
               THE DOOR: The mound of sand is gone and in it's place is 
               Imhotep.

               INT. FOYER - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a 
               stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.

               O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob, 
               still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.

               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she 
               sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.

               Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth 
               instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the 
               bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes up. Sees Imhotep's 
               rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.

               Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Get your hands off my girl, pal.

               Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 
               O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Nice lips.

               Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I figured you might be here, so I 
                         brought a friend.

               He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively 
               catches it.

               He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back towards the 
               window, -- which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep spins like a 
               dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.

               Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES 
               out the window and vanishes over the compound.

               Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.

               O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.

               Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on the 
               floor... and drops the martini glasses.

               INT. 1923 CONVERTIBLE DUSSENBERG - NIGHT

               Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets, 
               HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell, 
               looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.

                                     EVELYN
                         You called me your girl?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, 
                         you know, figure a speech.

                                     EVELYN
                         I think you were jealous

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see 
                         that guy's face?

               Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,

                                     DANIELS
                         Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do 
                         somethin'! we gotta do somethin, 
                         NOW! Before it's too late!

               They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities.

               EXT. CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT

               A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling 
               with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins 
               to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people 
               begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a 
               severe sickness -- it's already too late.

               Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted 
               off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his 
               side, looking very nervous.

               And then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow 
               Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS 
               AND SORES.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT

               O'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Ray 
               follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum.

                                     EVELYN
                         Last month I came across an 
                         inscription that mentioned The Book 
                         Of The Dead.

                                     DANIELS
                         That book we found at Hamunaptra?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked 
                         about bringing people back from the 
                         dead. A notion I was unwilling to 
                         believe.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Believe it, sister. That's what 
                         brought our buddy back to life.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And now he's going to use it to bring 
                         his girlfriend back

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And if he succeeds, the two of them 
                         together will bring about the 
                         apocalypse.

               The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
               stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.

                                     THE CURATOR
                         The plagues we have seen so far, are 
                         merely Imhotep flexing his muscles. 
                         Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's 
                         resurrection will he be truly 
                         invincible.

               They reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm thinking that if the black Book 
                         Of The Dead can bring people back to 
                         life --

                                     CURATOR
                         -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of 
                         The Living can return them to the 
                         underworld.

                                     EVELYN
                         Exactly --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So your sayin', if we find the book 
                         made outta gold --

                                     CURATOR
                         -- And read the sacred incantations 
                         contained inside it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You think it'll send this guy back 
                         to hell?

                                     CURATOR
                         Correct, And that's when --

               LOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside. They all rush 
               over to the upper windows and look down -- OUTSIDE: A large, 
               CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores comes CHANTING 
               up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!'

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         It has begun. The beginning of the 
                         end.

                                     EVELYN
                         Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon.

               Evelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows.

               EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

               The crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are 
               locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while 
               CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT

               The BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the 
               Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets.

               The others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece.

                                     EVELYN
                         Got it!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got what?

               The BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn 
               talks while quickly translating the tablet:

                                     EVELYN
                         Since the black Book of The Dead was 
                         found inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         then according to this, the golden 
                         Book of The Living should be inside...

               Evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?

                                     JONATHAN
                         What?

                                     DANIELS
                         WHAT!?

                                     EVELYN
                         The golden Book Of The Living, is 
                         inside the statue of Horus.

                                     CURATOR
                         Which would be located not far to 
                         the east of the Anubis statue.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't tell me we gotta go back out 
                         there?

                                     CURATOR
                         If we want to kill the creature, 
                         yes.

               TWO HIDEOUS BOIL & SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway, 
               SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray grab them and chuck them 
               over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into 
               the lower display cases. The front doors suddenly BURST OPEN, 
               The crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul ass 
               across the balcony and down the staircase.

               EXT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITY - NIGHT

               Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his 
               convertible. Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob 
               comes around the side of the museum. Jonathan instantly bugs 
               his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins CHANTING --

                                     JONATHAN
                         Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

               The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors 
               of the museum. Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it 
               up and 180's it back over to the bushes.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Ray and the Curator jump 
               inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.

                                     BENI
                         Imhotep! IMHOTEP!

               Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper 
               windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points 
               a finger at Beni as they race past him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You're gonna get yours, pal!

               Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman 
               size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.

               His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out 
               of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.

               EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT

               The convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street.

               Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the 
               car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them 
               overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car, 
               CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before 
               they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He 
               TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a 
               corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing 
               several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK! 
               CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like 
               rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.

               The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them 
               and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down 
               his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, 
               and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He 
               holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through 
               his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.

               WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased 
               mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...

               INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT

               The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE 
               DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to 
               O'Connell. Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back.

               All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.

               Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the 
               windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses 
               control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

               They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob 
               quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his 
               gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into 
               his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way 
               to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth 
               Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the 
               lit match near the fuse.

               The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring 
               at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.

               And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated, 
               he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did 
               the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.

                                     EVELYN
                         He's gorgeous.

               O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He 
               YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it 
               across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives 
               O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.

                                     THE CURATOR
                         He has consummated the curse, now 
                         all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun 
                         from the dead, then it will be the 
                         end of us, and the beginning for 
                         them.

               Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell 
               LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops, 
               watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The 
               tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the 
               stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward 
               and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on 
               Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Koontash dai na.

               Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.

                                     BENI
                         Take his hand and he will spare the 
                         others.

               Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty 
               crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, 
               waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident, 
               powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         Any bright ideas?

               O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sorry, fresh out.

               Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to 
               take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, -- 
               but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't do it, Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                         I have no choice.

               Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes 
               around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.

                                     BENI
                         Come with me my princess. It is time 
                         to make you mine, forever.

               Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him --

                                     EVELYN
                         All eternity, idiot.

               Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.

                                     EVELYN
                         You better think of something, because 
                         if he turns me into a mummy, you're 
                         the first one I'm coming after.

               O'Connell almost smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got guts, lady.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep 
                         them.

               Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and -- 
               RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine -- !

               Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.

               O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of 
               Ardeth Ray's grip.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn!

               The huge, powerful man holds him tight.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Be calm. There is still time. We can 
                         stop him yet.

               The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep 
               stops and looks back at O'Connell.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Pared oos.

               Evelyn SCREAMS.

                                     EVELYN
                         NOOO!!

               Beni smiles.

                                     BENI
                         Kill them.

               Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's 
               grip and stumbles forward.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         EVELYN!

               But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.

               O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE 
               COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after 
               him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole.

                                     CURATOR
                         Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!

               The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth 
               Ray crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator 
               apart.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray slosh their way down the 
               watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a 
               LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then 
               more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats.

               O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Ray ahead 
               of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby 
               fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.

               FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies.

               STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

               The EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air, 
               followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE...

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We gotta get her back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I'm with you, old man. No one touches 
                         my sister like that and gets away 
                         with it.

               O'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You know where he's taking her?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the 
                         ritual.

               Jonathan looks worried.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And what ritual would that be?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         The ritual to bring the body of Anck-
                         su-namun back to life.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And how does one do that?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         By reading the Book Of The Dead.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh yes, of course.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And then killing your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Excuse me?

               Ardeth Ray looks at O'Connell.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Imhotep is now able to cross the 
                         desert with great haste.

               Jonathan taps him in the shoulder.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Begging your pardon, but I wasn't 
                         quite clear on that last part.

               Ardeth Ray ignores him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         If he arrives before us, it will be 
                         too late.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you say 'kill' my sister?

               O'Connell smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I know how to beat him to it.

               And on that WE SMASH CUT TO -- THE ERFOUD DUNES - DAWN 

               Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set 
               of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with 
               R.A.F. INSIGNIAS sits in the sand beside them. A SIGN READS:

                               HIS MAJESTY'S ROYAL AIR CORP

               EXT. QUONSET HUT - DUNES - MINUTES LATER

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray stand before Winston 
               Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background.

                                     WINSTON
                         So what's your little problem got to 
                         do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Not a god-damned thing.

               Winston looks intrigued.

                                     WINSTON
                         Is it dangerous?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You probably won't live through it.

               This really interests him.

                                     WINSTON
                         By Jove, do you really think so?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Everybody else we've bumped into has 
                         died, why not you?

               Winston nods his head, he's hooked.

                                     WINSTON
                         So what's the challenge then?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         To save the damsel in distress, kill 
                         the bad guy and steal his treasure.

               A slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives 
               them a snappy salute.

                                     WINSTON
                         Winston Havlock at your service, 
                         sir!

               SAHARA - DAY

               Way off across the desert, a large SAND-DEVIL races over the 
               dunes. The SANDY WHIRLWIND comes to a stop and starts to 
               dissipate. Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it, 
               they land in a dune. The SWIRLING SAND CONDENSES AND FORMS 
               INTO IMHOTEP. He looks up into the sky, listening carefully.

               Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni.

                                     EVELYN
                         What just happened?

                                     BENI
                         All I remember is him turning into a 
                         blast of sand,... and then I remember 
                         nothing.

               Then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.

               INT. BIPLANE - DAY

               The WIND whips at Winston in the cockpit. O'Connell sits in 
               the gunner's compartment. Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle 
               across the left wing, Ardeth Ray is tied tight to the right.

               Both men are scared out of their wits and SCREAMING in fear.

               EXT. SAHARA - DAY

               Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size, 
               he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. -- And 
               a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert

               BIPLANE - DAY

               O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise 
               up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees 
               what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the 
               plane into a dive.

                                     WINSTON
                         Hang on, men!

               WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting 
               biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.

               O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT 
               FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.

               O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and 
               FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the 
               sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw 
               unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.

               Winston blindly fights for control, elated.

                                     WINSTON
                         We're going down!

               The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING. 
               Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston 
               Havlock LAUGHING.

                                     WINSTON
                         Here I come, laddies!

               O'Connell braces himself for impact,

               SAHARA - DAY

               Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.

                                     EVELYN
                         Stop it! You'll kill them!

               Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare 
               into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes 
               herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.

               EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY

               The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside-
               down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls 
               out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed 
               into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Excuse me... A little help would be 
                         useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH 
                         TROUBLE!!

               O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to 
               the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's 
               mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a 
               cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell 
               and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.

               A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the 
               sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and 
               look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides 
               away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane 
               vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND...

               HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the 
               volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, now what the hell does this 
                         Horus guy look like?

                                     JONATHAN
                         He's a big fellow with pointy ears 
                         and a face like a falcon.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got it.

               HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY

               Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make 
               their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading 
               into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.

               NECROPOLIS - DAY

               Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She 
               stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through 
               the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his 
               rifle into her back and pushes her forward.

                                     BENI
                         Keep moving.

               Evelyn gives him a look.

                                     EVELYN
                         You know, nasty little fellows such 
                         as yourself, always get their 
                         comeuppance.

               Beni suddenly looks worried.

                                     BENI
                         Yeah?

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh yes, always.

               Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on 
               his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the 
               disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               O'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed 
               doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, look at that.

               He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in 
               his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to 
               glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Say, gents! You should come have a 
                         look at this.

               The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the 
               scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into 
               Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.

               O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The 
               scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips 
               out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's 
               arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in 
               front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being 
               cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.

               The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying 
               back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.

               O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM!

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and 
               Beni step-up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years 
               ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.

               Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC 
               JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's 
               heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading 
               from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a 
               mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.

               Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.

               TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking 
               mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests.

               They bow to Imhotep, then turn and move off down a passageway.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               O'Connell helps Ardeth Ray mend Jonathan's wound.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         From now on, don't touch anything. 
                         Not a damn thing. Keep your hands 
                         off the furniture, got it?

               Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni 
               holds his gun on her, translating:

                                     BENI
                         Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

               Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but 
                         that it's already taken.

               Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel 
               encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one.

                                     BENI
                         He wants your heart and your brain, 
                         your liver, your kidneys...

               Evelyn's eyes widen.

                                     BENI
                         ...and how do you say? Those slimy 
                         things, in your stomach?

                                     EVELYN
                         Intestines.

                                     BENI
                         Yeah! Them.

               Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep.

                                     EVELYN
                         You only want me for my organs?!

               Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her -- WAP!

               Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold, 
               malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums.

               Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.

               TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and 
               drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his 
               gunnysack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray crawl in behind him.

               O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting 
               through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a 
               wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his 
               gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning 
               the mirror into the shaft of light, -- And WHAM! THE SHAFT 
               OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM 
               FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP.

               It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing. 
               Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray are speechless. That's 
               when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Who the hell are these guys?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Priests. Imhotep's priests.

               O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I never killed a priest before.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         They are evil, cursed, they matter 
                         not.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Well, okay then.

               O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.

               BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.

               O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips 
               through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy, 
               blows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.

               The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the 
               loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh come on, gimme a break here.

               And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning 
               over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS echoing 
               out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into another of 
               Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty liver and 
               crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage 
               from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (ancient Egyptian -- 
                              subtitled)
                         Kill them! Kill them all! And bring 
                         me the Book Of The Living!

               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray back away from the mummy pieces. The floor 
               where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two 
               more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More 
               mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of 
               the piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes.

               O'Connell lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Ray stops him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         My turn.

               Ardeth Ray OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit 
               out of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now.

               O'Connell OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING 
               as all three of the men back away and haul ass. The mummies 
               and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.

               Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at 
               all the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels 
               and rolls about.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Evelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar. She 
               blinks, then turns her head, -- and looks right into the 
               ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS.

               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY

               The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into 
               the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray race down a 
               passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         This whole place is comin, alive!

               The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around 
               another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical. 
               Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray 
               FIRING as they go. Ardeth Ray goes empty.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         I'm out.

               He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into --

               HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               -- A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of 
               HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.

                                     JONATHAN
                         There he is!

               They run up to the base of the statue,

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hello Horus old boy.

               O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the 
               passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a 
               stick of dynamite. Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Allow me.

               O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to 
               look at the statue. Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes 
               the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.

               Ardeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the 
               passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.

               Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing 
               the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way 
               out, -- another dark, creepy passageway.

               INT. CEMETERY

               Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly 
               struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start 
               surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous 
               mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, -- which now sounds 
               even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths 
               in the room.

               Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead. His 
               hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed 
               cheek.

               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the 
               secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth 
               Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the 
               dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         These guys just don't quit.

               Ardeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells 
               and runs off towards the mummies.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Keep digging!

               O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder 
               on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.

               The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?

               Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts...

               And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND 
               and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST 
               up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with 
               the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.

               One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another 
               grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A 
               third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.

               AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL 
               THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in 
               the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

               INT. CEMETERY

               Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.

               A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.

               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Ardeth Ray BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies. over at the 
               base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate 
               chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips off the 
               lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.

               He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he 
               reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD 
               Book Of The Living -- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces 
               as they stare at it in wonder.

               The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel 
               and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Save the girl! Kill the creature!

               The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.

               O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it 
               against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That's the last one, we better get 
                         lucky.

               The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, -- but now here's a hole 
               for them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through 
               the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY

               Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled 
               with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.

               Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.

               Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him 
               and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the 
               door.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock 
               back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.

               Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling 
               hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and 
               into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.

               The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.

               The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and 
               IMHOTEP'S READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty 
               EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.

               Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with 
               empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then 
               she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         With your death, my love and I will 
                         be invincible!

               He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in horror. And that's when O'Connell and 
               Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.

               Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I found it, Evy! I found it

                                     EVELYN
                         Shut-up and get me off of here!

               O'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand, 
               jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests.

               The Priest-mummies stop chanting. The MIST vanishes.

               Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial 
               knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests 
               stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.

               EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, READ FASTER:

                                     EVELYN
                         Open the book, Jonathan! Open the 
                         book! That's the only way to kill 
                         him!

               O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies, 
               fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly 
               SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan fumbles 
               with the book, struggling to open it, -- he can't.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I can't open it! It's locked or 
                         something!

               O'Connell CUTS two of the mummies in half, then swings his 
               sword down at Evelyn, -- CLANG! One chain breaks free.

               Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS along 
               the binder. It hits him like lightning --

                                     JONATHAN
                         We need the key!

               Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain 
               around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket 
               He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

                                     EVELYN
                         Read the inscription on the cover!

               O'Connell swings his sword down again, -- CLANG! Evelyn now 
               has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell 
               force him back.

               Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription, 
               but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Keetash-something, naraba-something.

               Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching 
               the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?

               Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.

               O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding 
               Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!

               Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.

               And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES 
               through the wall -- shades of Ray Harryhausen. Only better.

               The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares 
               angrily down. Jonathan stares back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh boy.

               O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         This just keeps gettin, better and 
                         better.

               Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.

               O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, 
               frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack, 
               forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to 
               head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her 
               around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.

               Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in 
               ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for 
               O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus 
               moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

                                     JONATHAN
                         You have got to be joking?

               Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun.

                                     EVELYN
                         Finish the inscription, idiot!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh.

               Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best 
               she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on 
               the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure --

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now 
                         what is this last symbol here?

                                     EVELYN
                         What's it look like!?

               Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of Anubis 
               corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's 
               MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares 
               at the inscription, slightly oblivious.

                                     JONATHAN
                         It's an Anck symbol, with two little 
                         squiggly lines above it, and a bird, 
                         a stork! on either side.

               Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun.

                                     EVELYN
                         Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes,... I see.

               The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hootash im Ahmenophus!

               The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks 
               and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell 
               slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away, 
               Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream 
               just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to 
               powder and DRIVING her into the ground.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily 
               heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly 
               backpedals on his hands and heels.

               O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for 
               Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden 
               Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall.

               O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP!

               SLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still 
               clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and 
               spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay pal, let's see how tough you 
                         are without your right arm.

               Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him 
               half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a 
               gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes 
               it off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Alright,... so he's left handed.

               Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up 
               his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I got it!

               Evelyn runs for Jonathan.

               O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten 
               flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep 
               looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.

               Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.

               O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS 
               him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,

               SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage 
               in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS 
               into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in 
               the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with 
               him.

               He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.

               Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.

               Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed 
               hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn 
               yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working 
               the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.

               Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum, 
               swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES 
               through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.

               No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and 
               casually flings it away.

               The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan 
               holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages 
               looking for something.

               O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat 
               and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed 
               mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, 
               then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About 
               to die.

               Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:

                                     EVELYN
                         Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! 
                         PARED OOS!!

               Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror 
               on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which 
               starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.

               And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out 
               of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The 
               mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits 
               attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.

               Imhotep lets go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.

               Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits, 
               Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of 
               The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the golden 
               book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks like 
               he's about to cry.

               Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's 
               body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.

               Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the 
               beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. One 
               last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep 
               is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet, 
               he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.

               O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword 
               scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across 
               Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the 
               blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.

               O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him 
               backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus 
               bog. The sword still in his stomach.

               Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as 
               Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And 
               then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at 
               them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               Evelyn translates:

                                     EVELYN
                         Death is only the beginning.

               Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile.

               STAFF CHAMBER - DAY

               Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight 
               of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large, 
               ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag 
               over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.

               A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF 
               DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.

               Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.

               ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons 
               of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber.

               CEMETERY - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls 
               start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon!

               He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking 
               pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower 
               and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick 
               the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees.

               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure 
               chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the 
               treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again 
               and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards 
               a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of 
               the sinking walls is deafening.

               Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn 
               and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a 
               staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already 
               half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet 
               high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.

               Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives, 
               but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.

               O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of 
               time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand --

                                     BENI
                         O'CONNELL!!

               O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand 
               back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.

               Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as 
               the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks 
               around with his diminishing torch.

               All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's 
               trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over 
               in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.

               Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.

                                     BENI
                         Go away.

               He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens 
               upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.

               Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.

               And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.

               And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.

               And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a 
               pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING CREVICE 
               DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through the 
               front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.

               They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind 
               them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the 
               wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels 
               race out into the desert...

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PLATEAU - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the 
               plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the 
               sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well,... I guess we go home empty 
                         handed.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Wouldn't say that.

               Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms 
               around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell returns it.

               Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs 
               up onto a camel.

               When the kiss is over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile, 
               then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs 
               Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her 
               arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.

                                     O'CONNELL/JONATHAN
                         TUK-TUK-TUK!!

               The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag 
               behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can 
               see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.

A pinpoint of light appears.
Red.  An ember. 
Unseen BELLOWS blow.

GLASS FURNACE

The embers glow.  Flame.
The fire GROWS.

A RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS

Heated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. 
White Hot.

GLASS FACTORY

Flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls.  
Coarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of
intense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood,
it too now old and dry.

SMOKE

Billows up the walls.
Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of
the vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures --

A MAN

On a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. 
His clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. 
He is a MONK.

LOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open.
The smoke begins to escape.

The Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch --
Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX --
a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope.
He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by --

MORE MONKS

By their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil.
They blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished
pieces.  The old way.

ONE PARTICULAR MONK

Black skinned, early fifties.
Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but
he is watching something else.  It moves him to song.
Lilting tenor lifts high into the air.
This is BROTHER KYLE.

			BROTHER KYLE
	Well would he guess the ascending of the star,
	Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were.
	He knew the course of every malady,
	Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry.
	Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.

We see the object of his song:

BROTHER JOHN

Not yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.
The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.
A good face, nonetheless.
He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar.
Next to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of
him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.

		       BROTHER KYLE
		Tend you quickly he will,
		with bottles from a shelf.
		But heals not, so easily,
		The ills which plague himself.

Brother John stops stirring.

		      BROTHER JOHN
		   (to Kyle)
		Enough.

He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the
Burned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool
mixture contacts the injured area.  

		     BROTHER JOHN
		  (to the burned Monk)
		Relax.
		  (to Kyle)
		Put those lungs of yours to better
		use.

		     BROTHER KYLE
		Yes, Doc Tor.

Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass --
a BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end.

He rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of 
iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. 

John wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn.

			     JOHN
		Keep this from getting wet.  Go home at
		late afternoon mealtime and don't come
		back to work today --

		     BURNED MONK
		But John --

			     JOHN
		I'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today.
		You're lucky you only burned yourself on
		the side of the furnace.  If some of that
		glass had gotten on your arm --

He points to the top of his forearm.

	   	            JOHN
		-- it would've burned clean through to
		the other side.

He mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm.
The Burned Monk shudders at the thought.  

BELLS toll.
 
		            JOHN
		That's late afternoon.  Now get on.

			BURNED MONK
		Thank you, John.  I --

			   JOHN
		You're welcome.  Go!

The Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest.
John gathers his mortar, pestle, and extra bandages into a
burlap sack.  Kyle comes over.

			  KYLE
		Good work.

			  JOHN
		All right, but I'm no Father Anselm.

  			  KYLE
		You're yourself, that's better...

Kyle pushes him through the door...

INTO THE HALLWAY

The Hallway is alive with cassocked monks.
Their LOW CHANTING reverberates throughout the building.
The wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights.
This is obviously a MEDIEVAL MONASTERY...

			KYLE
		The Abbot will be pleased.

			JOHN
		Don't.

			KYLE
		Don't what?

			JOHN
		Please don't tell him.  At least until
		I know if there's an infection.

			KYLE
		You want to be the Abbey's Physician,
		and you haven't learned the first rule:
		Don't worry about the patient.

John's face drops.

			KYLE
		I shouldn't have. Sorry.  Look, I know
		how you must --

			JOHN
		You don't, but thanks anyway.

AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY

A wide stairwell.  A constant stream of monks all moving down
the stairs.  Coming from floors above.  Headed for lunch.
Kyle starts down.  John starts up --

			KYLE
		Not coming down?

			JOHN
		I have someone waiting for me.

Kyle disappears into the crowd.
John moves up...

THE STAIRWAY

A river of brown cassocks running downstream.
John is the only one moving against the flow.
He exits the stairwell --

ONE FLOOR UP

A narrow corridor lined with doorways.
John moves to one in particular.
He doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob.
This is his room.
He opens the door --

IN BROTHER JOHN'S ROOM

An old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock
which is now serving as its bed.
At the sight of John it stands.

			JOHN
		Come on, Mattias.

The dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall.
Monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. 
Past another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down.

INT. LIBRARY

A vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches
between aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves
jammed to capacity with BOOKS of all shapes and sizes.  Millions
of books, from the looks of it.
From each book hangs a long CHAIN, long enough to allow the 
book to be carried only as far as the nearest table.

A CORPULENT MONK - BROTHER PHILIP

In his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his
position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large
KEY hanging from his belt.  He watches the few stragglers return
their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door,
then rises and joins them...

IN THE CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY

John leans against the wall as Philip exits.
Mattias is nowhere to be seen. 

			PHILIP
		Brother John.

			JOHN
		Brother Philip.

			PHILIP
		Feeding the mind instead of the body
		again?

			JOHN
		My training has taught me to feed what's
		hungry.

Philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.

			PHILIP
		As did mine.  As long as you're alone.
		Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book
		leaves the library.

			JOHN
		How could I forget?  Have a good meal...

John watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs.
When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock
to reveal Mattias.

			JOHN
		Perfect.

They move into the library...

THE MEDIEVAL SECTION

The oldest books.
John moves to the stacks.
Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits.
This is his regular place.

AT THE SHELVES

John stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome.
He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding.
A smile plays across his lips.

He carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so
there is slack in the chain.
Sits on the bench next to the dog.
Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...

			John
	    	    (reading)
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks --

			VOICE O/S
		Sometimes, I think you'd like that.

John turns to find --

THE ABBOT

Leader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger.
His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden
CHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table.

John closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.

			John
		Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --

			ABBOT
		Mind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed
		him on the way up.  He said you'd come 
		in alone.  I knew better.

He scratches the back of Mattias' neck.

			ABBOT
		Hello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?

The dog snuffles in response.

			ABBOT
		You know what Philip says about Mattias'
		hair and his breathing.  You'll have to 
		take him out of here.

			JOHN
		He likes when I read to him and -- I 
		can't --

John looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels
almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot.  
The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.

			ABBOT
		    (smiles)
		Someone must have left this one unlocked.
		Take the book with you.

He hands the key to John, who is shocked --
this is a great honor.

			JOHN
		Father, I --?

			ABBOT
		Kyle tells me you did a good job at
		the glassworks today.

			JOHN
		I'll reserve judgement until the patient
		lives.

John crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book.
He returns the key.

			ABBOT
		It will get easier.  Father Anselm was...
		an unexpected loss.  You'll do fine.

The Abbot walks towards the door...

			ABBOT
		Just have it back before the end of lunch.
		Oh -- And I didn't see you in here.

			JOHN
		Thank you.
		      (to Mattias)
		Let's go upstairs, boy.

John takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase.
Mattias at his heels.
Goes UP --

INTO THE BELL TOWER

The mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs
cast scary shadows.
A doorway leads to --

THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Thick with sandy dust.  The wood shows through thin patches.  
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey
is actually --

THE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT

The door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID!
The curving horizon broken only by the very top of the
Abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below.  
SMOKE curls from vents set into the surface.
Sunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS.

This is ARCEON.
An manmade orbiter.
A shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter.
Constructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable
level within finished in whatever material suits its end user.

This orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been
sheathed in wood.

JOHN

Walks to the shore of an inland SEA.
Sits on a bare patch of wood.  Looks up.
His eyes grow accustomed to --

THE NIGHT SKY - JOHN POV

Freckled with tiny dots of light.
Stars.  Spread across the inky void.
Bathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow.

John smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. 
The atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. 
He opens the book.
Reads aloud --

			JOHN
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day
		by day, one by one, until I am the only 
		one left.  I stayed as long as I could bear 
		it, then with my dog -- 

Mattias lifts his ears at this part.  His favorite part.

			JOHN
		- fled.  I have put this to parchment lest
		this pestilence - this Black Death - 
		stay my hand.
			(beat)
		This was finished by another hand...

John closes the book.  Something catches his eye --
Something among the myriad points of light in the sky.
Millions of miles away:

ONE OF THE STARS

Brighter than the rest.  MOVING.
Fast enough to leave a faint trail.
Across the stars.  And down...
A comet.

John stands.  Watches --

THE STAR

Growing brighter.
Drawing nearer.

JOHN

Joined by three other MONKS.
They are older than he.
The Four men watch the sky...

THE STAR

Brighter still.  Closer.

MORE MONKS

Two dozen.  A hundred.
They come up through the planet's surface.
Out of wooden trap doors.  Join the others.
Days pass.
Now three hundred.
Necks bowed back.
Mouths agape.
A SUBTITLE identifies...

			RELIGIOUS COLONY ARCEON
			-----------------------
			POPULATION: 350 Exiles
			CRIME:  Political Heresy

THE STAR

Fills the sky.
Burns brighter still as it hits the planetoid's atmosphere.

ON THE SURFACE OF ARCEON

Hundreds of Monks shield their eyes as the ship -- the star --
ROARS over their heads.  Trailing FIRE --

John holds up his hands - to touch a star --
Skin BLISTERS as it passes over him,
He turns and watches as it --
Arcs downward --

INTO THE SEA

WHOMP- SSSSSSSSSS --!!
PLUMES of steam rise into the air.
The water boils.  Fish bob to the surface.  Bloated.  Dead.

JOHN

Is the first to hit the shore.
Small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake.
His coracle is the first into the water.
The others running up behind him.
He cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning.

ON THE SEA - DAWN

The sun cracks over the black water.
John's hands move the rough wooden oars.
Blistered palm opens.
BLOOD flows.
He tears off a piece of his cassock --
Rips it with his teeth --
Wraps the bloody hand.
Rows.

THE STAR

Ship.  Star Ship.
Sulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water.
White metal skin blackened by the heat.

JOHN

Rows right into it.
His coracle pitches in the choppy surf.  
He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface.
Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH.
Looks around for a knob, a handle --

NEXT TO THE HATCH

A small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote
urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny
metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat.
Then quickly pulls it down...
WUORRRSH -!
Hull door OPENS.

The doorway is a black maw.
John crosses himself.
Begins to lower his foot into the hatch --

			KYLE O/S
		Watch it!

He almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back --

THE OTHER MONKS

Are rapidly approaching.
Kyle gestulates wildly --

			KYLE
		John!  Wait -- !  Don't go in!

John turns back to the open hatch.
Machine recirculated air flows out.
He feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool.
Cool, and artificial.  It calls to him.
He steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness --

WHOOSH-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

INT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY

Dark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to
the darkness.  He sees:

NEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE

A glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its
base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the
head of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt
warning -- is audible...

			COMPUTER VOICE
			(sotto)
		Seal broken...seal broken...

John finds himself moving towards the tube...
Looks through the broken lid:

IN THE TUBE

There is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white
interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown.
Whatever happened here happened a while ago.
Rust colored drips trail down to --

THE FLOOR

Drag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of
Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn.
Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found.

JOHN

Looks back towards the door.
Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights
back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone
in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- 
Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and
glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- 

LIGHTS

Pressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights.
Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky.

It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and
never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear
now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....

ON A PALE GREEN SCREEN

LED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07
A legand identifies "Elapsed since separation."
He moves on...

A VIDEO MONITOR

Through scanning bars of snow, an image:
A WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her.
The Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl.
Protective. Maternal.

The Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself.
A tape loop, although John has no idea what that is.

			WOMAN
		...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS
		Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead.
		Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper
		sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has
		hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed.
		Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt 
		and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of...

The WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear.
He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship,
following the trail of blinking instruments --
Drawn to touch a button.  Click...

SOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER!
Just an oxygen mask.

John feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the
plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. 
His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and --

HSSSSSSSSS -!
A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe --
John SHOUTS and back up into --

ANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!!

Next to Newt's now empty tube.
Humming gently.  Still operational.
John approaches it cautiously.
He can make out the occupant through the lid...

A WOMAN

The woman from the screen.  This is RIPLEY.
In hypersleep.  Wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer-type
shorts.  Christ, she looks beautiful.  

John looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back.
Sinks to his knees, reverent.  Fascination has replaced fear
again.  Moves his face closer to the lid.  
Closer to hers...

DAYLIGHT spills in --
John's head WHIPS towards the source of the light --

THE DOOR

Open.  Kyle and the other monks.

			KYLE
		John - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship?

			JOHN
		No.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone
		in here --

The Second Monk looks at Kyle.

			SECOND MONK
		This is forbidden.

			KYLE
		John.  Just get the hell out of there --

			JOHN
		I don't want to stay.  I have to get her
		out before this sinks.  You come in, give
		me a hand --

			KYLE
		Her?  Look, this is not the supply ship,
		so this is technology forbidden to us.
		Get out of there now!

John looks down at Ripely.
A KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube.
A red button:  "EMERG-OPEN"
That's plain enough.

			JOHN
		All right --

He presses it.
The Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air.
The Monks at the door recoil at the sound.

						CUT TO:

EXT. SPACE SHIP - ON THE SEA - DAY

Ripley has been lowered into a large coracle.  John holds her in
front of him.  Unconscious.  
Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves. 
The monks start to row back to short.

			FIRST MONK
		     (reverent)
		A space ship...

			SECOND MONK
                    (even more reverent)
		A woman...

			KYLE
		You shouldn't have gone in --

			JOHN
		I'm supposed to be a doctor.

He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead.

			JOHN
		She could've been lost.

			FIRST MONK
		Been a long time since I saw either.

			SECOND MONK
		It isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we
		supposed to do with it?

			KYLE
		What was it like in there --?

			JOHN
		Lights.  So many lights --

			THIRD MONK
		Tow it in.  Bring it in.

			SECOND MONK
		It's evil.

			FIRST MONK
		It's just technology.

			SECOND MONK
		Evil technology.  Look at these fish --

			THIRD MONK
		The Abbot will know what we should do
		with it --

			KYLE
		Just lights?

			JOHN
		Machines.  Buttons.  Metal.

			SECOND MONK
		See?  Just look at the fish.

			THIRD MONK
		The Abbot will know.

			SECOND MONK
		They're boiled.  These fish are boiled. 

			JOHN
		Thousands of lights.  Like the stars.
		Like Heaven on Earth.

Ripley stirs in John's arms.  Groans.
Fights to come out of her fugue state...
Looks around through half-lidded eyes --
She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks.
MONKS?  She closes her eyes.
Tries to clear the imagine.  Opens:
They're still there.
She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist --
realizes she's sitting on someone's lap.
Looks back over her shoulder --

JOHN

He smiles at her.
Friendly, not sexual.

RIPLEY

Shakes her head.  Tries to speak --
Her lips form soundless words.
She looks over her other shoulder, sees --

THE SHIP - RIPLEY POV

Bobbing on the surface.  
Growing small with each stroke of the oars.

RIPLEY

Brows knit.  Fights the cobwebs in her brain.
Tries to focus on the ship --
Remembers. 
Turns to John, tries to speak --

			RIPLEY
		Wait.  New...

She loses consciousness.  

						GO TO BLACK...

INT. THE ABBEY - RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

Streaks of light move across the darkness.
Form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls.
There is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are
the muted, far off SOUNDS of the Abbey --
The SAWING of wood.  HAMMERING.
WHISPERED prayers.
LILTING song.

We move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed.
Ripley in restless sleep.

EXT. ARCEON SEA - DUSK

The waters grown rough with the approach of night.  Wind whips across
white wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their 
boats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes --
Start to tow it to shore...

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ripley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe --
She tries to sit up -- can't.  Tries to shake off the effects of
the suspended animation...looks up through half-lidded eyes:

JOHN

Sits next to her.  Quite asleep.
Hands swathed in white bandages.  Book resting on his lap.

She squints to make the figure standing in the shadows
behind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of
flickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves --

THE ALIEN

Big, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light.
It moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side --
moving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - 
to cry out -- She can't.

She can only move her eyes.  She looks over at John, sleeping
peacefully.  He doesn't notice the Alien --

The Alien moves closer.  
She can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her
forehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move --

The Alien stands alongside her bed.
Extends a six-fingered hand...
Gently rests it on her stomach.
Cocks its head -- like it's listening to something.
The implication is clear.

Ripley finds her voice --

			RIPLEY
		AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!

Her eyes open wide --
She sits bolt upright.

A hand moves to her forehead.  Gently pushes her head back to
the pillow.  John's.

			JOHN
		You're out of it.  Out of it...

Ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared.
John sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder:
Nothing.
Ripley's eyes roll back into her head.
She tries to speak -- It was there.
Her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist --

John's hand covers hers.
Eases the fingers open again.
She feels the coarse bandages against her palm.

He starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions.
She begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her
like waves lapping against the shore...

EXT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DAY

A HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.  The monks wear small round
goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a 
huge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement --

Hundreds of ropes grow TAUT.
Timbers GROAN.
They LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal --

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

Ripley lays with eyes closed.
Muffled VOICES outside her door:

			ABBOT
		How is the woman, John?

			JOHN
		I don't think she's here yet.

At the sound of John's voice the SLIGHTEST smile plays 
across Ripley's sleeping lips.

			JOHN
		She is close, though.

As they continue talking, Ripley wakes.  Opens her eyes.
Rolls over onto her side --
There is a window right next to the bed.
Ripley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out:

HER POV

Garden of Earthly delights...
Monks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky --
picking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes.
Working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages.  Lyrical.
It makes her feel good.  She scans the countryside...

Sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet
up to the -- Ripley does a take --

WORKERS ON A SCAFFOLDING

With crude brushes at the end of poles -- PAINT the sky blue.
The Abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are all
on one level - INSIDE THE PLANET.

The vaulted CEILING, painted to look like the sky with huge
glass "windows" to allow the sunlight in, is actually the
UNDERSIDE of the planetoid's outer shell.

Ripley looks back at the Monks on the ground:
Instead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stacking
the wood onto push carts --

			RIPLEY
		What the hell --?

SUDDENLY --
The Sulaco Escape ship APPEARS in front of her.
SWINGS past her window suspended by ropes.
Then disappears up, out of sight.
Ripley checks her pulse.

			RIPLEY
		This must be a dream.  A bad one.

She rolls back onto the bed.
Stares up at the ceiling.

ABOVE HER - ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Monks scurry around the Ship as it is lowered into place on
a flat area of the roof above the libaray.
It seats with a deeply resounding THUD...

RIPLEY

Hears the SOUND and then another - her door OPENING.
She turns to find the Abbot and John standing in the doorway.
John waits in the doorway as the Abbot crosses to the chair by
the bed and sits.

			RIPLEY
		Who are you?

			ABBOT
		I am the Abbot.  Leader of this Colony.
		And you?

He smiles.  Open.  Friendly.

			RIPLEY
		Ripley.  How did I get here?

			ABBOT
		Your vehicle crash landed.
		     (indicates John)
		Brother John found you and brought
		you here.

			RIPLEY
		Where is here?

			ABBOT
		This is the Minorite Abbey within the
		manmade orbiter Arceon.

			RIPLEY
		Can I use a radio to --
	
			ABBOT
		We have no radio here.  We are a monastic
		order that has renounced all modern
		technology.  We live the old way.  The pure
		way.

She shakes her head.

			RIPLEY
		Uh, I - I still don't feel 100%.  Whoever
		took me out of the stasis tube must not 
		have run the full D-F program...
		Where's Newt?

The Abbot looks at her blankly.

			RIPLEY
		There was a little girl with me --

			ABBOT
		You were alone.

			RIPLEY
		No.  She was with me.  I put her in her
		stasis tube -- We launched when the --

			ABBOT
		You were the only living thing found
		aboard that vessel.

The Abbot watches Ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her --

			RIPLEY
		     (slowly)
		Oh, God.  Newt.

She stops -- gets that chill up her spine --
She realizes that she MUST have brought the Alien with her.

			RIPLEY	
		It came with us.

The Abbot leans in.

			ABBOT
		What came with you?

			RIPLEY
		Listen -- there is a danger here.  It
		came with me.  How long have I been here?

			ABBOT
		Almost two days --

			RIPLEY
		     (calculates)
		Loose for two days.  This planet could be
		overrun within the week.

Ripley grabs the Abbot by his cassock --

			RIPLEY
		Look, there's a xenomorph --
		    (sees his confusion)
		An Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster.
		And now it's here.

The Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner
of Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day.  The
guy with his pants down around his kness.

She sees this, releases her hold on him...
	
			RIPLEY
		Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a
		platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission
		to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six
		months ago - maybe a year --

			ABBOT
		     (interrupts)
		Wait a moment --

The Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway.
Turns over his shoulder at him.

			ABBOT
		Leave us.

John waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door.

			ABBOT
		Continue.

			RIPLEY
		We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from 
		Gateway sub-orbital space station --

			ABBOT
		Not possible.

			RIPLEY
		What do you mean?

			ABBOT
		When we left Earth seventy years ago, it
		was on the brink of a New Dark Age.
		Technology was on the verge of destroying
		the planet's environment.  A computer virus
		was threatening to wipe away all recorded
		knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any
		way it could be averted.  In the almost
		forty years since we were towed out here
		in hypersleep, the news that came with 
		occasional supply ships only got worse.
		Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We 
		had to resign ourselves to the fact that
		worst had come to pass, and the Earth
		no longer existed.

Now she gives him that look.
	
			RIPLEY
		    (slowly)
		Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How
		many people do you have here?  Let's worry
		about them.  Warn them --

A new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear.  
Now she's getting to him - or is she?
He abruptly stands. 

			ABBOT
		Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest
		some more.

			RIPLEY
		I don't need rest - I need to get to 
		your people.  You've got to get to them --
		tell them about the alien --

He heads for the door --

			ABBOT
		I have had enough for now.

			RIPLEY
		Enough?  Didn't you hear what I said?
		It could wipe out the entire population
		of this planet.  It may have started 
		already - Have there been any unusual 
		deaths since I got here?

The Abbot stops in the door -

			ABBOT
		No.  And there won't be.

The Abbot SLAMS the door behind him.

THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

John stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two BURLY MONKS

			ABBOT
		Bolt it.

The guards move to bolt the door.

			JOHN
		What is it -- What's wrong?

			ABBOT
		Your patient is in a dangerous mental
		state.  Nobody gets in or out until I
		say so.

			JOHN
		But I.  Her meals --

			ABBOT
		Nobody.

			JOHN
		Father, I don't understand --

The Abbot turns and disappears down the hall.
John looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks.


THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

John has his head buried in his hands.  His back rises and falls
with the rhythmic breathing of sleep.
Mattias curled up on his feet.  Asleep as well.
WHAM!
The Library door FLIES open --!
John sits bolt upright -- 

A HYSTERICAL MONK bursts in.
Rushes to John's table.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Brother John!  You're here!  The Abbot
		said you'd -- I need -- you're the
		medic --

			JOHN
		What?!

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		My Sandy -- she's ill --

John tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes.

			JOHN
		Huh?  A woman?

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Sandy.  My ewe.

John returns his head to the table.

			JOHN
		One of your sheep?  Jesus Christ.
		Call a vet.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Father Anselm was the vet.

John looks under his arms at Mattias --
The dog just stares at him.

			JOHN
		You're no help.  Okay, let me get my bag.
		All creatures great and small...

INT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT

A small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens
in wire cages.  The wooden walss are full of gaps where boards
have been ripped off.

The Hysterical Monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene.  One of
his sheep is laying on its side...

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		I just gave her dinner and she
		keeled over.

			JOHN
		So would I.  It's freezing in here.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Been using the wood from the walls
		for the fire in my cabin.

			JOHN
		Haven't we all...

John kneels at the ewe.

She's breathing heavy.  Rapidly.

John puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he
checks the animal's neck pulse with his right hand.  
She gives a weak "Baa-ah."

			JOHN
		May be pneumonia.  Pitch some of that hay
		around her.  Stop this damn cold breeze.

The Hysterical Monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and
retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall.
Starts to pile hay around the fallen animal.

			JOHN
		First, I'll --

He sits up to reach for his back, then stops when he sees what's
on his left hand --

A SLIMY MUCOUS-LIKE SUBSTANCE

			JOHN
		Wait a minute...

The Hysterical Monk stops on mid-pitch.
John rubs the material between his fingers.
Brings it close to his nose.  Sniffs.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		What is it?

			JOHN
		I don't know.  It's all over the ground.
		Some sort of --

BAAA-AAAH!!!
The ewe starts to SHAKE - QUIVER --
John tries to hold it down --
The Hysterical Monk, at this juncture, goes completely apeshit.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		What?!  WHAT?!

			JOHN
		Jesus!  Help m --

The ewe is shaking so violently that John is thrown back --
He knocks over the bucket -- the torch falls into the hay --
The light is cut off as the torch almost smothers.
Then the hay starts to burn --
Weak fire light revealing:

BAAaa-Aha-SCLORTCH-H-!!
THE EWE EXPLODES ---!

Stomach BURSTS --
SPRAYING the two Monks with entrails and blood --
They start SCREAMING.

The flickering FIRE LIGHT grows as...

A TERRIBLE ALIEN CHEST-BURSTER

BURSTS out of the jerking and twitching carcass.

It shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has
gestated.  Tiny razor sharp teeth and black, glass-like eyes
peer from a enlongated head covered with downy, but gore-matted
WOOL.  A quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to free
itself from the cooling morass of intestines.

John can only SCREAM as the most horrible nightmare he can
imagine tries to slough off the animal's mortal coil.

The Hysterical Monk, fear overcome with ANGER at the loss of
his beloved Sandy,  steps in front of the near catatonic Medic
and instinctively THRUSTS his pitchfork into the creature --
The sharp prongs PIERCE its still forming body --

The CREATURE

WAILS a high pitched SHRIEK - half alien, half sheep as it is
roughly TORN from it's nesting place --
The Monk lifts --

It TWISTS at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the
wood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of FIRE.

The Hysterical Monk turns to the now raging hay fire --
The entire corner of the barn is ablaze --
SHOVES the abomination in --

The Sheep/Alien POPS and SIZZLES as tongues of flame leap up to
lap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about --

The creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound
heard within the barn.  The Hysterical Monk holds his fork in
the flame as he looks back to check on --

JOHN

Face contorted, eyes glued to the burning creature.  Heaving
lungs push air through his diaphram, but no sound comes from
his open mouth -- The Doctor in training has seen the devil.

EXT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT

Wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre.
Acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out
across the rafters...

We pull back from the sight INTO a window. Into

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ripley, watches the burning barn.  Frustrated, she climbs out of
the bed on unsteady legs, wearing her tank top and shorts.
Pulls on a coarse wollen cassock, ties the rope belt --

			RIPLEY
		Idiots...I'll --

WHAM!
The door BURSTS OPEN --

			RIPLEY
		What the -?

Four BURLY MONKS rush in and grab her.
TEAR her out of bed --

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ripley is dragged down the darkened hallway.

			ABBOT V.O.
		An evil has come to Arceon...

IN THE TRIBUNAL ROOM - NIGHT

As he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, ending
at the Abbots...

			ABBOT
		You heard Brother Graham tell of the
		devil inside sheep's wool --

He motions towards the Hysterical Monk, sitting in the crowd.

			ABBOT
		An evil brought by this woman in her
		vessel of technology.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet
high.  Light creeps in through stained glass windows.

Hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over
the floor of the Tribunal.  On the floor:

The Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facing
the witness stand.  On the stand:

RIPLEY

Considers the faces that surround her.  Fear.  Hate.

			RIPLEY
		This can't be happening.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		You have no voice in this tribunal.

			RIPLEY
		You must listen to me!  You're all in
		terrible danger!  It came with me on
		the ship --

			ABBOT
		We know that.  At first we believed its
		arrival was a good omen.  But it has only
		brought pestilence.  Dead sheep.  Dead fish.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		Evil.

Ripley turns to the Abbot.

			RIPLEY
		Yes, the ship brought it.  Not evil. It
		brought the Alien.  I told you, it's here.

			ABBOT
		We know the name of the evil it brought.
		It brought technology.  Technology to
		destroy our planet, as surely as it
		destroyed the Earth.

			MONK IN AUDIENCE
		Destruction!

			RIPLEY
		I was on the Earth less than a year ago.
		It's still there.  People, cities, all 
		still there!

A murmur through the crowd.  Some are listening to her.
The Abbot looks around.  He must be in command.

			ABBOT
		    (matter of fact)
		All dead.

			RIPLEY
		    (screams)
		It's still there!

The Abbot smiles to himself for making her crack.
He stands and begins to pace.

			ABBOT
		You could not have been on the Earth a
		year ago, because there is no Earth to
		be on -- for at least twenty years.

			RIPLEY
		I haven't been floating in space for
		twenty years.  Let me get to my ship
		and I'll prove it.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		No.  Who knows what new evils she'll
		release if allowed back into that
		infernal machine.

			MONK IN AUDIENCE
		No!  Don't let her!!

			TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		This woman is a danger.  She denies The
		New Dark Age.  She denies reality.

			RIPLEY
		This is reality.  There is a Xenomorph
		loose on this planetoid - a alien -- it must
		have stowed away on my ship -- must have
		killed --
			(swallows hard)
		Newt.  Killed the girl I brought with me.
		You can't stop it.  It goes inside you like
		an egg - grows -
			(mimes)
		Explodes out of you - keeps growing into
		some sort of monster.  Kills you --
		Kills all of you...

She looks at the Medieval people around her.
They stare at her in complete confusion.
To them, she does sound like a madwoman.

			RIPLEY
		Who are you people?  Look at you -- all
		of you -- the way you're dressed.  This
		isn't the Middle Ages.  You're in space --
		on a artifical planet.  What are you
		doing out here?

There, in the upper tier -- John.  They make eye contact. 
She looks to him pleadingly.

			RIPLEY
		Isn't there anyone here who will
		listen?

John looks from Ripley to the Abbot.
The Abbot stares him down.
John turns away.

			RIPLEY
		    (defeated)
		I guess not.  I can't believe this...

The gavel BANGS.
The Abbot sits in a moment of contemplation.

			ABBOT
		Then there is no choice.

The Four Monks grab Ripley roughly --
Bind her arms.

			ABBOT
		   (to Ripley)
		The evil is inside you.  I cast you down.
		To be sealed away.  And God have mercy on
		your soul.

						SLAM CUT TO:

THE SHAFT ROOM - DAY

A Medieval elevator shaft.  The "elevator" is a wooden cage
lowered on thick, rough hewn ropes.
Ripley, bound, is led to it.

She looks back at the monks who have gathered at the door --

			RIPLEY
		You won't be able to fight it...
		You don't know what it is --!

She's put into the cage.  The door is secured.
Two monks begins to pull the ropes.  The cage is lifted out over
the abyss -- a vast cavernesque space.

The other Monks move closer.  Crowd around the edge --
John pushes through them - right to the edge --
Watches as the cage is slowly lowered down...

Ripley looks directly at John --

			RIPLEY
		You've sentenced yourselves to 
		death!

John watches as she disappears down into the darkness...
Then turns and pushes his way through the crowd --
Down the hall --

THE TRIBUNAL ROOM

Empty now except for the Abbot and the Tribunal Members.
They speak in hushed tones.
John appears in the doorway, but pauses -
strains to hear what they are saying:

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		...they'll have started before she gets
		down to the Hermitage level.

			ABBOT
		No trouble?

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		Only finding the wood for the ship.  But
		Anderson's hut was about that big, and
		he's dead three months now.

			ABBOT
		I had that wood earmaked for the Cloister 
		next winter.  Well, we might not get to
		the winter if we don't take care of this.
		By winter time we can start taking the 
		penitent cells apart.  No one in them.

			ANOTHER TRIBUNAL MONK
		The wood isn't going to last forever.

			ABBOT
		Neither are we --

He becomes aware of John's presence, and motions the other
Tribunal members out of the room.  John moves to the Abbot.
The Abbot knows what's coming...

			ABBOT
		Go ahead.

			JOHN
		This woman.  Ripley.  I tended her --

			ABBOT
		Yes, and you did a good job.  You
		shouldn't feel responsible.  You
		couldn't have known --

			JOHN
		Please, sir, let me finish.  I feel that
		there may be something to what she says.

			ABBOT
		There isn't.

The Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel,
notebook.  John follows him --

			JOHN
		I don't understand what you are doing.

			ABBOT
		This colony is my responsibility.  I am
		protecting the colony.

			JOHN
		From what?  This woman?  You never gave
		her a chance.  How can you be so sure
		you're right?

			ABBOT
		A better question is what makes you
		think I'm wrong?

			JOHN
		You didn't see this thing -- this demon --
		Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it.

			ABBOT
		      (realizes)
		That's right.  You both did.
		      (beat)
		And what was it?

			JOHN
		I -- I don't know what it was.  But I
		don't think Ripley was a party to it.

			ABBOT
		She admits she brought it.

			JOHN
		But she tried to warn us --

			ABBOT
		You know that's how the devil works.
		Deception.

			JOHN
		But I believe her.  I don't know how to
		describe it -- A feeling.

			ABBOT
		You haven't seen a woman in thirty years.
		Where does this feeling originate, John?

			JOHN
		     (points to his head)
		Here.

Pause.

			ABBOT
		I believe you.  But your feelings are
		fooling you.  

			JOHN
		It's - It's her conviction.  I just think --

The Abbot snaps at him --

			ABBOT
		Don't think.

John takes a step back at the Abbot's tone.  A tone he's never
heard before.  The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair.
Forces a smile.

			ABBOT
		It's been a long night.  For all of us.
		You really don't understand what you're
		dealing with here.

			JOHN
		That's what she said.

The Abbot chafes.

			ABBOT
		These are ideas which threaten the very
		system we live under.  The creature is
		dead and the woman is gone.  Forget them.
		Both.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere,
		but leave this alone.

			JOHN
		But I --

			ABBOT
		Alone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias
		into the Library, all right?  For your
		own good, just stay out of this.

John looks like he's going to protest.

			ABBOT
		I mean it.

			JOHN
		     (slowly)
		Yes, Father.

John turns and leaves the room.  
The Abbot stares after him.


INT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

Dark. Dank. Dreary.
A NAIL is hammered into a board.  Then another.
The board is old, twisted.  The grain is pronounced, splintered.

Another board is lifted into place, a nail held -- BAM-BAM-BAM -
HAMMERED in tight.


TWO ANCIENT WORKERS

Drab, torn gray clothing.
Hammer the boards over the opening in the wall.
Methodically covering up --

RIPLEY

Watching them work.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
Defeated.


ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY (INTERCUT)

A dozen Monks frantically hammer planks up around the Sulacco
escape ship - A frame of wood --
begin to wall it in...


IN THE PRISON LEVEL

The two ANCIENT WORKERS continue their carpentry.
The planks cover more of the opening.
BAM-BAM-BAM.

Covers more of Ripley.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
She stares...


ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Planks are rising around the ship.
Covering it.  Locking away the good omen turned evil.

IN THE LIBRARY

John and Mattias sit before an open book.
He doesn't read.  He can hear the POUNDING of the hammers.
It seems to reverberate THROUGH the planet.
Through his SKULL.
He closes his eyes in pain.

RIPLEY

Only her face is visible.
Another board.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
Then just her eyes.

Just before the last plank is put in place --

			WORKER
		Here you go, woman.  Something from your
		ship.  Something to keep you company --

He tosses it into the cell.  Ripley catches it.
Watches as the last of the light is covered over.
BAM-BAM...BAM.

She continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow
accustomed to the darkness.  The little light creeping between
the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see
what it is she has caught --

NEWT'S DOLL'S HEAD.

Ripley looks around her cell -- actually a narrow space behind
other cells, one wall curved out -- like a narrow slice
crossways towards the edge of the pie. 
Looks at the Doll's head in her hand.
A beat.

She FREAKS OUT --!

			RIPLEY
		You fucking idiots!  You're dead!
		You're all dead!

BEATS the walls.  KICKS.
SMASHES her HEAD against the wall.
Again.
Her nose starts to bleed.
Her hand goes to her nose.
She squints in the darkenss.
Sees the BLOOD.
Tastes the iron taste in her mouth.
Death is with her again.

			RIPLEY
		     (sotto)
		Dead...

The "widest" part of her cell, the middle, allows her to slide
down into a sitting position.  She does.

			RIPLEY
		Christ.  Jesus Christ.  It's here.  Here.
		Shit.  Here.  I can't get rid of it...

Looks at the Doll's head --

			RIPLEY
		Newt.  This isn't what I wanted...

She throws the doll's head away --
It bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright position
so that it is staring at her.

			RIPLEY
		     (snaps)
		Don't stare at me!

Beat.

			VOICE O/S
		Sorry.

Ripley looks down at the base of the wall facing her --
Where it meets the floor, in the rotting timbers:
A HOLE.  In it:

A MAN'S FACE

Bright, wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut.
He's looking back at her.


ON THE ROOF OF THE MONASTERY - NIGHT

The Sulaco escape pod #4 is now a memory as the Monks have
finished walling it up.  Now just another part of the Abbey.

As the Monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow --
Pass them -- down to an open window and into...


INT. LIBRARY - THE MEDIEVAL SECTION - NIGHT INTO DAWN

John is here, Mattias asleep at his feet.
The tables, the benches, the floor are COVERED with hundreds of
books he's pulled off the shelves, their chains all TANGLED.
All open to --

PICTURES OF DEVILS

Different representations of Evil through the ages --
Lucifer, Shaitan, Ahriman, Asmodeus -- Satan.
"The Temptation of Christ" from the Master of Schloss
Lichtenstein.  Satan roasting on an enormous grill from
"Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry."

The devil as a serpent.  As a semi-humanoid.
Gruenwald's "Temptation of St. Anthony."
Pacher's "Saint Wolfgang and the Devil."
A miasma of Medieval Monsters.


JOHN

Picks his way through the mess.  Like a man possessed he fumbles
through book after book.

The first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge
stained glass windows.  John rapidly flips through the Medieval
tome in front of him - past an illustration of Satan depicted
as having a FACE on his ASS -- further still -- then stops.
This is it.

We can't see what the illustration is, but we see his REACTION:

His eyes open wide as saucers.  SLAMS the book closed as if the
image would strike blind.  He turns to Mattias as if to say
something -- Decides not to wake the sleeping dog.

John wraps the book's chain around his hand and puts one foot
up against the shelf.  Pulls -- SPANKT!
The old chain gives way.

Face set, he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag
over his shoulder.  Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets
his sleeping dog and goes...


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ABBOT'S OFFICE - DAY

John strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and
flattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's 
office opens suddenly --

BROTHER GRAHAM, The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the 
room by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other
direction.  He is gagged.  A third Burly Monk moves out of the
doorway with the Abbot.

			JOHN
		Now find John and have him brought to 
		me immediately.

			THIRD BURLY MONK
		Yes, Father.

			ABBOT
		Start in the library.  And keep it quiet. 

The Third Burly Monk nods and moves off.
The Abbot watches him leave, then goes back into the room and
closes the door.  John stares at the closed door a beat and then
makes up his mind.  He turns and runs back down the hallway...


INT. GLASS FACTORY - DAY

The first Monks straggle in for the morning shift.
Kyle is among them.  He lifts his blowing iron from a wall
mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two
other Monks begin to stoke the fire.

John enters.
Looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find --


KYLE

At the glass furnace.  About to dip his blowing iron into the 
MOLTEN GLASS.  John runs over to him.
Almost knocks him over --

			KYLE
		Hey!  Watch it!

He sees that John is agitated --

			KYLE
		What?  What is it?

The other monks begin to notice the commotion, start moving in
for a look...

			JOHN
		I -- Abbot.  Must --

John tries to catch his breath.  He gestulates wildly.
Kyle puts down his blowing iron.

			KYLE
		John - relax.  Take a deep breath -
		Christ, now I sound like you --

He sees the book clutched in John's white knuckled hands.

			KYLE
		Is that it, John?  Is it the book --?

			JOHN
		     (panting)
		Yes.  Devil.

Kyle moves closer to him.  Cautiously.
John sees the other monks gathering around --
Closing in on him - whispering --

			WHISPERING MONKS
		He's got it...

			SECOND WHISPERING MONK
		Like the Comet Woman...

			THIRD WHISPERING MONK
		He found her...
		
			WHISPERING MONK
		He's infected...

John sees one of the Monks run out -- undoubtedly going to tell
the Abbot.  John looks into his friend Kyle's face -- Fear.

			KYLE
		Everything's gonna be fine.  Now, let's
		see the --

			JOHN
		Don't humor me -- I'm --
	
			KYLE
		Sure.  Everything's gonna be fine...

If only he could explain - he can't.
John YANKS the book away -- spins --
Bursts through the crowd...

			KYLE
		Wait -- JOHN!


INT. SHAFT ROOM - DAY

The cage is still down, the ropes stretching into the abyss.
John runs in.  Moves to the ropes.  Places the book on the floor.
Tightens his scarred hands on the rope -- Mind racing:  
The woman will know.  Know what it is.  How to combat it.
He PULLS --

There's no tension against the ropes.
John FALLS back on his ass.

The ropes WHIZ through the rusty pulley overhead.
Pile on the floor in front of John. 
He lifts the end of the rope.  Stares:
BITTEN THROUGH.

							CUT TO:

THROUGH THE MONASTERY - SERIES OF SHOTS

John RUNS through the building.
Through the upper half of the planet.
DOWN through the many levels, past dozens of Monks oblivious to
the previous night's events and the danger they face:

Monks working at Looms.
Monks in the Tanning Room.
Monks in Morning Prayer.
Past them all, to --


INT. ABBEY BASEMENT WORKROOM - DAY

Mops and brooms.
John enters.  His hair is wild, breathing heavy.
He shoves the book into his medical bag.
Pushes aside a box of kindling wood to reveal a
WOODEN DOOR set into the timbers of the floor.
He opens the door:


LADDERS

Extending down through huge open areas beneath the upper level.
Past vast underground viaducts that held up by wooden rafters.
Beyond that - a great underground sea that marks the center of
the planet - below that, the cells.
And Ripley.


JOHN

Can smell the dank air from the lower tunnels.
He MUST go down -- The hard way.
He climbs into the darkness...


INT. ABBEY LAVATORY - NIGHT

An enormous room, over a football field in length, consisting
of at least a hundred open toilet STALLS facing a hundred wall
mounted SINKS.  Their condition, though, bespeaks the awful
truth -
The stalls furthest away from us are COBWEBBED.
Some have had the side walls stripped for fire wood.
Of the original hundred sinks, maybe twenty are still
functional - A facility created for a much larger number of
colonists than are left.

A SKINNY MONK washes his hands.


IN THE STALLS

Moving down the row of stalls (chest high, thank you) past a
few empty stalls and several grimacing faces, the second to
last being The Abbot --

			ABBOT
		Cold tonight --

-- continuing to the last, Bald Tribunal Member.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		Gets colder every night.

			ABBOT
		And every day.  Never this bad.  Taken
		so much wood out of the structure the
		surface wind blows right through the
		colony.  Right under the floor --

The Bald Tribunal Member SHIVERS as a cold breeze runs along the
waste trough under the floor and chills the air in his bowl. 

			BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		Right up your bloody backside.  Nights
		like this make me miss plumbing -- 
		Ack --!

He feels a TUGGING at his bowels - it's not piles. 
A beat.

			ABBOT O/S
		What?

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		I don't -- AAH --

The Bald Tribunal Monk SCREAMS as something GRABS him from
below --

(note: the left half of the following 5 pages is cut off.
I have completed the text to the best of my ability.)

Something SNAKES up his rectum and hooks into his lower intestine!
He convulses in spasms of agony.

There is a terrible RIPPING SOUND as the Bald Tribunal Monk is 
PULLED VIOLENTLY down -- out of frame --

We PAN BACK down the row of stalls tight on each sitting Monk
and see their HORRIFIED REACTION as they feel the ALIEN drag the
Bald Tribunal Monk's body away under them...

THE ABBOT in his stall

He pounds on the wall --

			ABBOT
		Matthew?  Matthew?  Jesus, what's wrong?

SKINNY MONK washing his hands, sees all this.  Looses control
of his bodily functions as blood sprays from the faucet --


OTHER MONKS

In their stalls as the toilets reject a torrent of gore!  
Blood and viscera spraying the walls -- converting the Abbey
into an abattoir.

							CUT TO:
SPACE

Angle on the Orbitor Arceon:

An orb of wood hands peacefully against a tapestry of celestial
seas.

			RIPLEY V.O.
		Death...


INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - NIGHT

Darkness.  Somewhere water drips into a puddle.
Ripley lays on her side on the floor with her head resting
near the hole in the floor.  Her eyes are closed.

			RIPLEY
		Wherever I go.

A HAND pushes a crust of bread through the hole. 
She opens her eyes to look at the food.  The White-Haired Man's
head appears --

			WHITE-HAIRED MAN
		Take it.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks, but no thanks, Anthony.

She knows his name.

			ANTHONY
		You waiting for meat?  They don't bring
		me meat because they know I'm an android.
		Really don't need it.  Bread's better
		for you anyway.  Harder to digest, so 
		it makes you feel fuller than you are.

			RIPLEY
		Not hungry.

Anthony takes a bite.

			ANTHONY
		Mmmm.  Just a little crunchy.

Ripley twists onto her back until she's staring up at the
ceiling.

			RIPLEY
		Waste of time.

			ANTHONY
		You don't eat, you'll starve to death,
		girl.

			RIPLEY
		That was the plan when they put me down
		here.  And why should you care?

			ANTHONY
		Because I'm a synthetic person you don't
		think I can care?

			RIPLEY
		Believe me, that's a discussion you don't
		want to have with me.

			ANTHONY
		You told me you had a bad experience and
		a good one with androids --

			RIPLEY
		That's one of each.  That means you could
		go either way.  I'm tired of talking about
		this.

He pushes the bread towards her again.

			ANTHONY
		You've still gotta eat.  You gotta fight
		the bastards --

			RIPLEY
		I'm tired of fighting.  Maybe I'll be
		dead before he finds me.  Maybe he won't
		get the satisfaction.

			ANTHONY
		He?  You make it sound like this Alien
		has a personal score to settle with you.
		The biology you describe:  Queen laying
		eggs, larvae, drone -- that's very
		insectoid.  Insects usually don't bear
		grudges.

			RIPLEY
		And Androids usually aren't the prisoners
		of lunatics that believe they're ancient 
		Greeks.

			ANTHONY
		Medieval Monks.

			RIPLEY
		Whatever.	

			ANTHONY
		And they've only chose to live the life
		style, they don't believe they're --
		     (hears something)
		What's that?

Ripley strains to listen.  In the distance:
KNOCKING.  Someone is knocking on the walls.
A VOICE calls out --


INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

			JOHN
		     (hoarse)
		Ripley!

He moves down the hallway.
BANGS his fist against the walls every few feet --
Waits a moment for a reply, then moves on.


INT. ANTHONY'S CELL

Anthony gets off the floor - Moves so she can see into his cell:

The walls of Anthony's cell are covered with charcoal sketches -
Different versions of demons and the devil.  She rolls her eyes -
This guy is an Android!

Anthony crosses to his cell door, peers through eye level.


INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR HALLWAY - ANTHONY POV

John coming towards him, knocking on the doors of boarded up cells.

			ANTHONY
		Hey -- you knocking -- cut it out --
		You're going to wake everybody up.

John moves to Anthony's door.  Looks at him through the slot.
Anthony recognizes him.

			ANTHONY
		Brother John?

John unbolts Anthony's door.
Picks him up by his cassock --

			JOHN
		Anthony?  Thought you dead fifteen years.

			ANTHONY
		Made too good for that.  What're
		you doing?

			JOHN
		I -- I'm looking -- the Abbot --

			ANTHONY
		What?  You look like you've seen the
		devil.

			RIPLEY O/S
		He has.

Anthony turns to look back at Ripley -- moves aside so John can 
see her face at the hole --

			ANTHONY 
		You mean he --

Anthony turns back - John is gone.

INT. THE CORRIDOR

As John begins to PULL the outermosk planks off.

			RIPLEY
		I was right, wasn't I?  You've seen it,
		you've seen the Alien?

John pauses at that.  
His eyes tighten at the memory.

			RIPLEY
		I can tell you have.  I was right.
		It came with me.
			(to the wall, sharp)
		Go away.

John stops.  Looks at the wall.
Ripley's voice comes clearly through the wood...

			RIPLEY
		Listen, priest, or whatever you are, I
		know what you want.  I can't help you.
		I couldn't help any of the others.  
		Just stop what you're doing.  Go away.
		Do you understand?

John has opened a crack that exposes Ripley's eyes.  
He stares at her a beat, tries to think of what to reply --
He goes back to work as she continues her confession...

			RIPLEY
		You going to stay, Father?  But you're 
		not going to talk.  Okay.  Then you can
		listen.  You should listen.  Your Abbot
		was right.  I am guilty.  But not of 
		heresy.  Of murder.

John stops again.
Just stares at her eyes.

			RIPLEY
		The murder of the crew of the Nostromo.
		That was when I first met the Alien.

That reminds him of why he's here.
He doubles his efforts at the boards...

			RIPLEY
		No, not the same one that's here now.
		Or maybe it is.  Maybe they're all the 
		same one.  I couldn't save my crew then.
		I should have been able to.  But I couldn't.
		When I went the second time --

Her eyes soften.

			RIPLEY
		Then I met Newt.  Newt.  I fought --
		stayed alive to keep Newt alive.
		Hoped maybe that would make up for...

She trails off.  Slides down the wall.

			RIPLEY
		Now he got her too.  What's the point?
		     (hard again)
		Just go away.  Leave me in here.  If you
		let me out you'll want me to help you
		and it will start all over again.
		Let it end.

John breaks through, flickering torch light streams in the mote
filled air around him.  Ripley looks up at him.

			RIPLEY
		I can't help you.

John, heaving and panting from the excertion.
Swallows...

			JOHN
		Puh. (pant) Please.

			RIPLEY
		It never ends.


INT. CORRIDOR - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

A long, twisted-plank-floored corridor with a torch every 
twenty feet.  There is MOVEMENT at the far end.  Something is
coming towards us - FLICKERING in and out of the light and 
shadow --

			RIPLEY O/S
		Sheep?

RIPLEY, JOHN AND ANTHONY

Running together.  Anthony carries a long wooden staff like a 
spear.  John has his bag.  Ripley a torch. 
We move with them.

			ANTHONY
		It must be able to take on some of the
		characteristics of the animal it grows in.
		Maybe they are from some sort of aggressive
		soldier race -- warring parties drop the
		eggs on opposing planets --

			RIPLEY
		And the alien takes on the form of the
		creature that finds it, assuming that
		animal is the dominant life form on the
		planet.  So when it gestates in a man --

Ripley shudders at the memory.

			ANTHONY
		It's a biped.  In a sheep or cow, a quadroped.

			RIPLEY
		Shit.  I just didn't think it could do that
		to animals.

			JOHN
		Wait a minute - I thought you were the
		expert on this monster.

			RIPLEY
		Is that the only reason you came to get
		me out?  Because I knew about this thing?

			JOHN
		Yes.  I mean no.  I mean, that was part of
		it.  Look.  I never thought you were wrong.
		I was wrong not to say anything.  I was
		afraid to speak up.  It's hard to be a 
		monk, you know?

Ripley stops.  Looks at him.
A long beat.

			RIPLEY
		Thank you.  If anything, you're honest.

			JOHN
		We all are.  Took vows.

			RIPLEY
		I don't know about the Abbot.

			JOHN
		I'm sure he thinks what he did was right.

			RIPLEY
		Is that speaking up for someone?

			JOHN
		No.  Charity.

She smiles.  They turn a corner...


INT. SLOPING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

This hallway slopes downwards a few degrees.  The three find 
themselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance.

			RIPLEY
		All right, let's forget about the past
		and get on to our survival.  No more
		prisoners behind us?

			ANTHONY
		Not for years.

			RIPLEY
		Okay -- If the Alien's had a few days
		to lay his eggs our only hope is to get
		off this - What is this?

			JOHN
		Arceon.

			ANTHONY
		Satellite.

			RIPLEY
		Get to my ship and get off this Satellite.

			JOHN
		We can't.

			RIPLEY
		We can't what?

			JOHN
		Leave Arceon.  Can't leave the library --

			RIPLEY
		A Tape Library?

			JOHN
		Books.

			RIPLEY
		So?

			JOHN
		The reason we are out here.  Like the
		Monks who guarded Monastery Libraries 
		on remote islands off England during
		the First Plague --

			RIPLEY
		There must be books on other colonies --

			JOHN
		Some of these books survived the burning
		of the Libraries of Alexandria.  They
		contain knowledge that exists in no 
		other record.  Their value is unestimable.

He runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag.

			JOHN
		We're supposed to protect them.

			RIPLEY
		    (to Anthony)
		And what does an android have to do 
		with all this?

			JOHN
		He's a spy.

			ANTHONY
		The Company planted me here.

			RIPLEY
		The Company?  What does the Company have
		to do with this?

			ANTHONY
		They built this prison.

			RIPLEY
		Prison?

			JOHN
		Colony.

			ANTHONY
		Prison.  They are all political heretics.  

Ripley looks at John.

			RIPLEY
		You left that part out.

			JOHN
		The order was more of a counter culture,
		a reaction to the Technology that was
		beginning to take over everyone's lives.
		It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't 
		watch disk.  Walk, don't pump more carbons
		into the air.  The earliest members
		renounced technology.  Started to collect
		the remaining books.  Nobody would have
		noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus.

			RIPLEY
		Your Abbot talked about that.  The
		New Plague.

			ANTHONY
		A computer virus.  A bad program.  By
		this time the Corporate structure was
		transglobal, all the world's data storage
		systems were linked.  It spread through
		two countries before it was stopped.

			JOHN
		After a scare like that, thousands flocked
		to our retreat.  People started clamoring
		for written information.  For our books.
		They abandoned the modern ways --

			RIPLEY
		I think I can see how this comes out.	
		They gave up their possessions.

			ANTHONY
		This was a threat --

			RIPLEY
		To the Company.

			JOHN
		They sold the technology.  A movement 
		to live simply was quickly twisted by 
		Federal agents into a political movement
		against the Company-controlled World
		Government.  Too much was at stake.

			RIPLEY
		Too much profit.

			JOHN
		We were sentenced as political dissidents.
		This orbiter is our gulag.  All the men
		were packed up with all our books, and
		towed into space.  Ten thousand men.  The
		eldest died very quickly.

			RIPLEY
		The Company had such a sense of irony.  
		Sending you out on this wooden tub.

			ANTHONY
		I was placed among them as a sensor.
		Keeps tabs on the movement.

			RIPLEY
		So how'd they find out about you?

			ANTHONY
		I told them.  After the supply ship's
		stopped coming I saw no point in keeping
		up the charade.  Since I was a sort of
		walking reminder of technology, they cast
		me down.

			RIPLEY
		Join the club.
		     (to John)
		I figured this wasn't planned.  You don't
		have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be
		prudent to try to preserve man's written
		works for generations -- without women.

John looks embarrassed.

			RIPLEY
		And I don't know about your New Plague,
		but I was just on Earth and everything's 
		fine.

John has a doubtful look.

			RIPLEY
		I was right about the Alien, wasn't I?
		Means I must be right about the Earth.

The logic behind her argument is uncomfortable.

			JOHN
		     (beat)
		Perhaps.

			RIPLEY
		That's better than nothing.  Come on.

They reach the end of the corridor.
It opens into --


INT. TRANSOM SPACE - PRISON LEVEL

An enormous open space between "cell blocks."
The Wall behind them is honey-combed with corridor openings
going up four stories, connected by aged, warped wooden ladders
reminiscent of Indian cave dwellings.  Only wooden.

The room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them
-- falling off into gloom.

They stand silent for a moment, dwarfed by the size of the room
and the task ahead of them.  Finally --


			RIPLEY
		At any rate, let's forget about the
		Earth completely - whether you're right
		or I'm right what's important is getting
		the hell out of here.  From here my ship
		is...?

John points up at the ceiling.

			ANTHONY
		In Heaven.

			RIPLEY
		Right.  And this is...

Anthony and John nod.

			ANTHONY
		This orbiter was patterned after a 
		medieval concept of the universe --
			 (makes a circle in the air)
		They call the top half "Heaven - "

			JOHN
		The Abbey, the fields --

			ANTHONY
		The bottom half is "Hell."  Where we are.

			RIPLEY
		Aptly named.  What's in the middle?

			JOHN
		The sea.

			ANTHONY
		Really.

			RIPLEY
		Work with me here.  How far is it back
		to the surface of the planet?

			JOHN
		As a stone falls --- Five miles through
		the center.

			RIPLEY
		And the elevator -- the thing they
		lowered me down in?

			JOHN	
		Ropes cut.

			ANTHONY
		It's smart.  First he cuts their escape
		off, then works his way down through the 
		monastery level by level until there
		isn't a thing left alive.  Interesting...

			RIPLEY
		Well, you start appreciating him more
		than me and I'll find a way to shut
		you down, capisce, Andy?  How do we
		get up?

			JOHN
		There are ladders.

She stops.  John and Anthony continue on a few steps and then
stop and walk back to her.

			RIPLEY
		Five miles with the Alien between us
		and there?  Good luck, boys.

She turns and heads back towards her cell --
John catches her shoulder --

			JOHN
		You can't --

			RIPLEY
		Can't what?  Not help you go to your
		deaths?  I've had my fill of that.

			JOHN
		I need you.  I can't do it alone.

			RIPLEY
		I've fought these creatures twice
		before.  It take a lot to kill
		these things.  Heavy artillery.

			ANTHONY
		We don't have weapons here.

			RIPLEY
		How about something we can make weapons
		from?  Do you have anything like that --
		any modern things here?

John SHAKES his head vehemently --

			JOHN
		We renounced technology.  It was those
		things that caused the Plague.

			RIPLEY
		This is a man-made planet.  Something has
		to be recirculating your air, your water.

			JOHN
		God?

			RIPLEY
		Please.

			JOHN
		I don't know.  I just took it for granted.

			RIPLEY
		Most people do.  Without some sort of
		technology we haven't got a chance.

From behind them:

			ANTHONY
		There is technology.

John and Ripley turn to look at him.

			ANTHONY
		A room.  A Technology room.  Fresh air
		and water come out.

			RIPLEY
		An atmosphere processing plant --

			ANTHONY
		The heart and lungs of Arceon.

			RIPLEY
		Where is it?

			ANTHONY
		One level beneath the underground sea.

			JOHN
		That's five levels up --

			ANTHONY
		     (points into the gloom)
		On the other side of the orbiter.

John looks at Ripley --

			JOHN
		A chance.

Ripley looks from John's earnest face to the darkness and back.

			RIPLEY
		All right.  You've got me - so far.
		But here's the deal:  I don't know
		how many of your brethren are going
		to be alive when we get up there,
		but if we make it to my ship, you're
		all coming with me.  We'll take as
		many of your precious books as we
		can carry, but we're going.  I'm not
		going to fight this thing again to 
		end up alone again.  Understand?

John nods his head.

			RIPLEY
		We're all dead anyway.  We might as
		well go fi --

She feels a TWINGE in her midsection --
Doubles over.  Anthony and John each take an arm --

			RIPLEY
		Ugh - I'm all right.

She takes a deep breath.

			RIPLEY
		Still thawing out.  I hate hyper sleep...
		Come on.

							CUT TO:


INT. ARCEON - MONASTERY LEVEL - NIGHT

The formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorched
battlefield.  Wooden huts leveled.  Small fires dot the land.
The air thick with ash and greasy smoke.

DOZENS OF MONKS swarm across the countryside like ants on a 
mound of spilt sugar.  In one hand a taper or torch held high,
in the other hand their WEAPON: scythe, pitchfork, hoe,
whatever they could get ahold of, seem pitifully out of place.
Some pound sharpened stakes into the ground, others push carts
into rough barricades.

A "Platoon" of Monks huddle around trap doors open on the
wooden "ground."  More ladders.
They climb down to --


AN UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT

Just beneath the Monastery level of the satellite: an 
Underground Wheatfield.  Tall golden grass stretches out for
miles, swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support
the Abbey fifty feet above --

THE CEILING

A lattice-work of suspended troughs and wooden pipes --
the "plumbing," the understructure, of the Monastery.


THE MONKS

Descend the ladders single file.  Fear is in all of their faces
though most have only heard the stories.  They move cautiously
into the wheat.  Spread out through the field in the jaggedly
drawn skirmish line.


THE ABBOT

The Bald Tribunal Monk's dried blood splattered on his cassock,
stands atop an empty wooden wagon.  From this vantage point he
watches


THE MONKS IN THE FIELD

THRASH and POKE their way forward leaving trails through the
high grass.  Their attempt at an orderly progression quickly
falls apart as they get strung out all over the field.

			ABBOT
		     (sotto)
		Stay together.  Together...

Then another movement catches the Abbot's eye --
AHEAD of the Monks - the wheat waves against the wind.
Begins to ripple -- the wheat flattens.
a TRAIL forms.
SomeTHING is MOVING in the long grass.
Moving towards the Lead Monk -- FAST.

The Abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning - even
though the Monk closest to the moving trail is too far away to
hear him - before he can make a sound The Alien closes the gap -
Feeling horribly helpless he can only watch as

AARGH-Aa -!
The Lead Monk gives one strangled CRY before he disappears
beneath the surface of the long grass.  His taper falls
among the long, dry stalks -- begins to SMOKE...

The Abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before they
can.  He finds his voice:

			ABBOT
		Run!  RUN!

The Monks in the field turn from the spot where the Monk
screamed towards the Abbot -- TURN THEIR BACKS to the now
moving again trail --

			ABBOT
		No - NO.  The --

The Alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle --
RAKING through five Monks like a scythe through wheat.
His tail, arms WHIP out --
SNAP their spines like kindling.
Lost torches ignite the wheat...

The field BURSTS INTO FLAME.
Smoke fills the air.

In the smoky commotion the Monks break rank and start running.
Weapons in front of them -- SWINGING wildly --
Screaming.  Crying.  DYING.

One Frightened Monk runs through another with his pitchfork.
Another hears something crashing through the grass towards
him and buries his scythe in his best friend's chest.

And through it all the Alien seems to be everywhere.
Using the chalky smoke for cover as it SLASHES and TEARS its way
across the field --


THE ABBOT

Frozen in terror to the spot.   Squints through the smoke to see
what has happened to his flock.  Hears the WAILS of defeat
rising up from the wounded.

The waving grass is flattened as The Alien moves towards him --

He can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon.
He climbs down.  As his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a
shadow fall over him.  The little hairs on the back of his neck
stand up.  He slowly turns...

THE ALIEN

Rises out of the grass in front of the Holy Man.
Slowly rises up to its height of almost three meters.
It's long, smooth head is no longer black and slimy.

It is golden.
It's cable-like arms are sheathed in a straw-like covering.
It has adapted to the environment of the wheat field.  Its now
grass-like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile.

The Abbot SCREAMS and RUNS.


			JOHN O/S
		It isn't your fault, you know.


INT. TRANSOM SPACE - SERIES OF SHOTS

They move across the huge room...Anthony a few paces ahead.
Their candles throwing only enough light to see several yards.
Wind whistles through the huge room, timbers creaking like some
gigantic old house settling.

			RIPLEY
		What?

			JOHN
		Those things you said before --

Ripley remembers her "confession."

			JOHN
		I read about it in psychology books.
		Sometimes when people outlive someone
		they cared for, they transfer some of
		the guilt for that person's death to
		themselves.

			RIPLEY
		I got a belly full of that from the
		Psychtechs when I was on Earth.  Yeah.
		"Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something
		like that.  But that's not what I was
		thinking about.  I was thinking about
		my "friend" up there.

She looks up.

			RIPLEY
		He was on the pod.  He killed Newt but
		not me.  Why not me?  It's almost like
		he's playing with me.  Maybe they have
		some sort of race memory.  Maybe he
		knows what I did to his "mother."
		That's why he didn't just kill me.
		That would be too easy.  He has to
		torment me.

			JOHN
		You make it sound human.

			RIPLEY
		Hell, I don't know what it is.

John unconsiously fingers his book.

			JOHN
		I think I do.


INT. LADDER-WELL - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

At the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to 
another block of cell corridors four stories up.
Years of damp air have warped the ladder.
Ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand.
They climb...


INT. END OF PRISON CORRIDOR - FOURTH LEVEL - NIGHT

Dark.  Ripley is the first one up.
She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone.
The cells here have no doors.
She holds her torch in one --
An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation.


AT THE LADDER

John is just climbing off, Anthony right behind him.  
Anthony is winded.  He reaches up for a helping hand.
John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without
them, then reaches down to help Anthony.
Their hands clasp --


ANTHONY HAS A "VISION"

He is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing
peacefully at his side.
SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons.

Fish faced demons.  Man-headed bird demons.
They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs.
The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of
razor sharp fangs, SINKS THEM INTO HIS ANKLE --

Anthony SCREAMS -!


RIPLEY

Down the corridor HEARS the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony
fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp -


ANTHONY

Balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real 
world as he fights against the demons in his android mind --
He JERKS --
Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the DEMON SHEEP --
OFF the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him...


JOHN

Struggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand.
It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft --

			JOHN
		Jesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -!

He PULLS with all his might...


ANTHONY

SEES a horrible BIRD-DEMON grasping his hand in its beak --
BITING through his wrist.  He waves his staff in the air --
He aims for its head:
CRACK -!
WHACKS John's hand with his staff --

John HOWLS in pain - LETS GO --

Anthony TEETERS BACK ON ONE FOOT, arms waving in the air --

Ripley's hands SHOOT OUT --
GRAB Anthony's cassock --
STOP his fall.

Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror --
A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched
itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head.
Ripley has become the Alien.

WHACK!
Anthony HITS the Creature with his staff --
HITS Ripley on the head.
WHACK!
Again.  In the face.

John tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm --
WHACK!
The cane WHIPS against the side of his head, knocking him back.
Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock --
Opens her mouth - GRUNTS --

ANTHONY sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him.

WHACK! 
His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose.
She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance --
Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony --

JOHN GRABS THEM!

Wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo
wrestler LIFTS and FALLS backwards - carrying the three of them
into the corridor -- WHUMPH!

They land on the floor in a heap.
Anthony continues to FLAIL ABOUT --

Ripley and John pin him to the floor between them.
Finally, the vision leaves him.
He loses consciousness.


JOHN

Breathing heavy - opens his eyes --
He's staring right into Ripley's face.
Less than an inch away.
He's laying on top of her.
She's breathing heavy too.
A long, uncomfortable moment.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks.

			JOHN
		You're welcome.

They roll off each other.
Her hand goes up to her nose.
Blood.

			RIPLEY
		I'm all right.

John reaches into his bag, withdraws a small cotton bag.

			JOHN
		Hold this against your nose.  It'll
		stop the flow.

She looks over at him questioningly.

			JOHN
		I'm a doctor.

She holds the small bag against her nose.  The bleeding stops.
They move over to Anthony - try to help him to his feet.
He shakes them off.

			ANTHONY
		No - please.  Just let me sit.
		Awhile.

He rubs his temples.  White, milk-like sweat runs down his
cheek.

			ANTHONY
		Damn it.

			RIPLEY
		What was that?

			ANTHONY
		The reason I'm down here.

John points to his own eyes.

			JOHN
		Visions.

			ANTHONY
		Dreams.

			RIPLEY
		Androids can't dream...

			ANTHONY
		That's probably what they thought when
		they built me.  But my brain is cyber-
		organic - patterned after the human
		brain - it functions the same way a
		human brain does.  It accumulates random
		images and sensations during waking 
		hours, but unlike the human brain that
		sloughs them off during sleep --

			RIPLEY
		Androids don't sleep.

			ANTHONY
		Right.  Maybe they've fixed this on later
		models, but I don't.  Do you know what 
		happens to the human brain when it is
		deprived of sleep?  It starts to run off
		the dreams while you're awake, as 
		hallucinations.  Same thing with me.
		For twenty years I absorbed data on this
		planetoid.  A little after we lost contact
		with Earth the visions started.  They
		thought I was insane.  I had to explain 
		that it was because I was an android.
		They liked that even less.

			RIPLEY
		What did you see?

			ANTHONY
		What I always see.  Images of Monsters.
		Demons.

			JOHN
		They're portents.  They stand for an
		evil yet to come.

			ANTHONY
		Just images I've absorbed from those old
		books and have no way to get rid of.

			RIPLEY
		I saw the inside of your cell.

			ANTHONY
		     (shrugs)
		My head is full of them.  I try to get
		them out any way I can.

His eyelids droop.

			JOHN
		You need sleep.

			ANTHONY
		I know that.  I'll settle for rest.

He closes his eyes.  Ripley recovers the torch.

			RIPLEY
		Stay with him.

Ripley tried to stand - John takes her arm, pulls her down.

			JOHN
		No.  We all need rest.  You especially.

Ripley considers him.

			JOHN
		Doctor's orders.

She smiles and sits.

			JOHN
		Besides, you see what happens when you
		get ahead of us.  We should stay together.

			RIPLEY
		All right.  He's still above us, anyway.

			JOHN
		What do you mean?

			RIPLEY
		I've faced this evil twice before - I
		guess I've gotten sensitive to it --
		     (beat)
		You're really a Doctor?

John pats his canvas bag.

			JOHN
		See my bag?

			RIPLEY
		What's that book?

			JOHN
		Just a book.

			RIPLEY
		I don't buy "just a book" from a guy who
		says we can't leave the planet without
		the library.
			
			JOHN
		It's just... a medical book I might need.

			RIPLEY
		You don't have any food in there, do you?

			JOHN
		Only if you can eat bandages.

Ripley rubs her midsection.

			RIPLEY
		In a few hours that's going to sound
		good.  Going in and out of suspended
		animation - Christ I probably haven't
		eaten in a year.

			ANTHONY
		    (without opening eyes)
		You should've eaten the bread.

			RIPLEY AND JOHN
		Rest!

Ripley lets her head loll back against the wall.
Closes her eyes.  Time passes.
Her brow knits.
John sees this.

			JOHN
		You all right?

			RIPLEY
		Aces.

			JOHN
		You weren't hurt when I landed on you?
		Bruised a rib?

He reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock.
Feels her midsection.  His hands are warm.

			RIPLEY
		Are you sure you're a doctor?

He withdraws his hands.

			JOHN
		Sort of.  My father passed on when we 
		first came here.  The Abbey's Physician -
		Father Anselm - took me in.  He really
		raised me --
			  (pause)
		Taught me what he could before he
		passed away.  He was schooled on Earth.

			RIPLEY
		Well, I'm just hungry.

			JOHN
		You haven't eaten since I took you
		out of your tube.

			RIPLEY
		You did that...

She reaches out and takes hold of his hands.  Turns them over.

			RIPLEY
		You burned yourself on the escape pod.

Her hands on his makes him feel...uncomfortable.

			RIPLEY
		Thank you, I guess.

They look into each other's eyes --

			ANTHONY O/S
		You should've eaten the bread.

Ripley, embarrassed, releases his hands.
Looks at Anthony.  He's trying to stand.

			ANTHONY
		Enough rest.  There's beasties afoot.

They start into...


A NARROW CORRIDOR

Ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them.
Ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks.


INT. LADDER SHAFT

A great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere.
Seems at least a mile long.
The group climbs...


A SERPENTINE CORRIDOR

Liquid drips through the ceiling planks over head.
Falls into RED puddles on the slanted floor.

John kneels, dips his fingertips --

			JOHN
		Blood.
		     (sniffs)
		Mixed with sea water.

			ANTHONY
		We're getting close to the center of
		the arc -- near the sea.

			RIPLEY
		Blood.

			JOHN
		Getting close...

John HEARS somthing.
Raises his hand -- "stop"
The group stops.  Flatten themselves against the wall.

John takes Anthony's staff.
Moves forward with it held out in front of him...
WHIRLS around a blind corner --
SHOVES something against the wall --
Thump!
It struggles --

Ripley and Anthony run up -- raise their tapers --
Revealing:

			RIPLEY
		The Abbot.

Cassock torn, dirty.  Hair, eyes wild.
Anthony's staff across his throat. 
John pulls back.

			JOHN
		Father --

			RIPLEY
		   (sarcastic)
		What are you doing down here, father?
		You look like you've seen something
		that doesn't exist.

The Abbot runs his fingers through his hair.  Smoothes it down.

			ABBOT
		I was their spiritual leader.  I was not
		prepared to lead them in battle.
		Not against that thing.

			JOHN
		No one could be.

			RIPLEY
		I thought you said the evil was inside
		me -- that sealing me up was the answer
		to all your problems?

			ABBOT
		Destruction.  The destruction YOU brought
		to us!

			RIPLEY
		I only tried to warn you.

			ABBOT
		What are you doing with this woman --?

			JOHN
		We are going to the Technology Room.
		Trying to find some way to fight --

			ABBOT
		You don't join the devil to fight the
		devil.

			ANTHONY
		She's helping us --

			ABBOT
		Look who defends the deceiver -- the one
		who isn't even human.  John, can't you see
		what is happening?  On ancient Earth,
		during the Black Death - many believed
		that God had abandoned them, so they
		appealed to the Devil.  Flocked to him
		hoping to save their bodies - losing their
		souls in the bargain.

			RIPLEY
		Father, we're all on the run from the 
		same monster so let's not resort to the
		fire and brimstone routine.  I've been
		enlightened about your "movement."
		Pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a
		planet of heretics.

			JOHN
		Please. 

The time for pretense is past.

			ABBOT
		All right.  I was trying to keep you quiet. 

			JOHN
		Sir --?

			ABBOT
		I do what I have to do to keep the
		Brotherhood together.  We all gave up
		believing in Earth a long time ago.  How
		do you think they would feel if told
		their exiled was in vain?  That the
		holocaust they were trying to avoid
		never occured?  Those men up there have
		grown to live with it.

			RIPLEY
		And with you as their leader.

The Abbot smiles.  Ripley is sharp.

			ABBOT
		You threatened the status quo.

			RIPLEY
		So you, protector of knowledge and truth,
		lied to them.

			ABBOT
		Only about you.  The rest I still
		believe.  If Earth still orbits its sun
		there is no way it could have survived
		being reduced to Barbarism.

			RIPLEY
		You're as bad as the Company.

			JOHN
		Ripley --

			RIPLEY
		That's why you ran.  After all your talk
		death stared you in the face and you
		were afraid.

			ABBOT
		Not afraid of death.

			RIPLEY
		The Alien.

			ANTHONY
		The Organism.

			ABBOT
		The Devil.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM CORRIDOR

The now four refugees work their way into the final corridor.
Dark.  Turns at sharp angles.  Blind alleys.
The floor is uneven, wood aged and twisted.
Warped by years of water dripping from above.
The group strings out as it moves into the darkness, candles
held high...


ANTHONY

Bringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down --
SNAPP!!!
Everybody stops at the sound.

			ABBOT
		What was that?

Anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a--

			ANTHONY
		Man trap.

They lower their candles.  Look to:

THE FLOOR

Interspersed throughout the timbers --
Spring jawed, steel toothed, BEAR TRAPS.
Rusted.  Open.  And all around them.

			ANTHONY
		In case anyone tried to get in and
		tamper with the technology.

The four of them are standing in the middle of a mine-field of
man traps.  Nobody moves.

			ABBOT
		What do we do?

			RIPLEY
		Don't move.  Don't breath.

			ABBOT
		We can't just stand here and wait.

			RIPLEY
		Floor's too unstable to try to walk
		around them.

John pulls a loose board from the corridor wall.
Turns and kneels at the trap in front of him.
Pokes the end of the board into the jaws...
SNAP!!

The others jump at the sound --

			ABBOT
		John - what are you doing?

John pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws.
Moves to the next trap --
Snap!!

			RIPLEY
		He's thinking like a leader.  Everyone:
		Grab wood.  Spring the traps.  Clear a path.
		      (proud of him)
		Good work, Father John.

			JOHN
		Brother.

			RIPLEY
		Brother.  Let's go.

Ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her.  
Exposes a bit of the surface underneath --
It's METAL.

She touches the cool, familiar material.  Smiles.
Now she knows this is not a dream.
She turns and SPRINGS the trap in front of her --
SNAP!!


THE FOUR

Slowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a
candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in
front of them... SNAP-SNAP...SNAP. SNAP.
walking carefully around the yet unfired traps....


THE DOOR TO THE TECHNOLOGY ROOM

A huge wooden door with no knob or handle.  Looks like it could
almost be part of the wall.  John and Ripley are the first to
it.  They put down their planks and begin to feel around the
edges of the door for some purchase.
The Abbot joins them.


BACK IN THE CORRIDOR

Anthony lags behind.  He senses a presence in the hallway.
Hears a sound behind him.
We see a GLIMPSE of something --
He turns towards the sound --

Empty hallway.

He thinks.  Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to the
rear... SNAP!


AT THE DOOR

Ripley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls.
Ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and
exhaustion.  To get this far, and be locked out.
She feels sick to her stomach.
How long since she had food?
She looks over at John.
He is staring at her.
He turns red at being caught.  Cute.

			JOHN
		I just - are you allright?

			RIPLEY
		Tied.  Without sleep, food -- I just
		feel my age.
		       (smiles)
		Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a
		hundred.

She wipes her brow and goes back to knocking...

			JOHN
		Hello?

The wall beneath his fist sounds hollow.
Fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull --
The plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons.


BEHIND THE PLANK

A primitive KEYBOARD.  Circa late twentieth century.

			JOHN
		I think this is it.

Ripley and the Abbot move over to see.

			ABBOT
		Technology.

			RIPLEY
		Yeah - a hundred years ago.  An antique.

			ABBOT
		     (to Ripley)
		Go ahead.

			RIPLEY
		Go ahead and what?

			ABBOT
		Open the door, woman.

			RIPLEY
		I'll get to it, but listen to me --
		you may dress like you're living in
		the middle ages but you can't treat
		me like your chambermaid, or whatever
		Monks had.


UP THE HALL - ANTHONY

Hears the sound again.  Turns.
Nothing again.
He pauses... Turns back quickly --

The wooden wall MOVES - steps forward --


THE ALIEN

Adapted itself to look like WOOD.

It's body changes -- transmutes -- Cable-like sinew snaking
over grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio-
mechnoid alien appearance...!


ANTHONY POV

The weary android sees the Alien as a conglommoration of his
many Medieval images of demons.  He hears the Alien's hollow,
raspy breath.  It glides towards him...

Anthony steps back directly INTO A TRAP as his mind goes --
SNAP!!
The STEEL JAWS spring shut on his left ankle.
Milky blood-fluid starts to flow.

He finds himself in the same predicament as his vision --
Ankle pinned, the Alien's appendages circling him --
He screams.  AAAAAAAAAAAARGH --!


AT THE DOOR

Ripley is trying to work.  She punches numbers into the keyboard.
She is too exhausted to see straight.
They HEAR the scream --
John RUNS back --
Traps SNAPPING around him --
Ripley turns towards the sound --
The Abbot pushes her back to the keyboard --

			ABBOT
		OPEN IT!!

Ripley knits her brows.  Forces herself to focus.
Her fingers punch the keys.


THE ALIEN

Steps towards Anthony --
Snap-snap-SNAP-AP-!!
Traps snap closed on its tail, its legs --


HALFWAY DOWN THE HALL - JOHN

SNAP!!
His cassock is snagged in a trap.
He TEARS right out of it --
AT THE END OF THE HALL

Anthony is in the clutches of the Alien.
He WHACKS at the Beast with his staff, but his blows fall like
drops of rain on an elephant.

The Alien LIFTS him up to face him.  Anthony SCREAMS as his left
leg is stretched agsinst the tension of the trap's chain --
Blood pouring as white ribbons from his almost severed ankle.


FACE TO FACE WITH THE ALIEN

Anthony drops his staff and grabs each of the alien's arms with
his own android arms.  His extra-human strength keeps them from
squeezing him any tighter, but he cannot avert his gaze from
the smooth, eyeless face.

The Alien considers him.  Its thin, almost translucent lips pull
back to reveal rows of splinter-like teeth.  The jaws spread,
making room for the distended tongue:

The Alien HISSES --
PUTS OUT Anthony's EYES with a thin stream of ACIDIC SALIVA --
Artificial skin BUBBLES AND BLISTERS --


JOHN

Picks up Anthony's staff.
Begins to FLAIL away at the demon.


AT THE DOOR

Ripley is getting no response from the keyboard.

			ABBOT
		What's wrong?!

Ripley slides the keyboard out of the wall compartment.
The wires are so old they've broken.

			RIPLEY
		Shit.

She BITES the ends off the wires - spits out the insulation.
TWISTS the bare wire ends together...
Sweat runs into her eyes.


JOHN

WHACKS the Alien with Anthony's staff --
Again.  Again.  The creature will not let Anthony go.
The Android writhes in its grasp, his face now a blistered,
pulpy mass, eyes gone.


RIPLEY

Finishes hot wiring.  The keyboard hums to life.
Her fingers FLY across the keys --


THE ALIEN

Tail wraps around John's waist --
Pulls him towards it --
LIFTS him - turns him upside down --

Lips PULL BACK --

John's hands GROPE at the floor --

Sharp metal teeth SPREAD --


THE DOOR KEYBOARD

Lights:  CODE ACCEPTED
Ripley's head whips towards the corridor --


JOHN

His hand closes around the end of one of the traps --
He brings it up --
SNAP!!
It SLAMS closed on the Alien's extended Tongue -!
The Beast bellows!!
Whips its head from side to side --
Can't shake off the trap --
ACID BLOOD sprays out --!
Lands as pools of FIRE on the wooden floor.


THE DOOR

Opens with a strained blast of dust -- SEE-WHORCSSH!
The Abbot LEAPS inside --

			RIPLEY
		It's open!!


JOHN

PRIES Anthony's ankle out of his trap.
Scoops up his staff, drags the moaning Android --
Back up the corridor --


RIPLEY

Stands in open Technology Room doorway --

			ABBOT
		Close it -- close it -- it's coming -

			RIPLEY
		We wait.  John!!

John and Anthony appear out of the shadows --
Run/hobble towards the door --


THE ALIEN

Acid Blood DISSOLVES the traps' steel jaws.  PULLS itself free.
Head whips towards the escaping Monks -- if it had eyes they
would narrow to slits in anger --
RUNS up the hall --


RIPLEY

Follows John and Anthony into the Technology Room.
On the other side of the doorway: another keyboard.
She punches keys --

			ABBOT
		Hurry --

			JOHN
		HURRY!!


THE ALIEN

Yards away -- Limping.  Hissing.
ANGRY.


THE KEYBOARD

Acceptance tone "bings."
The Door starts to slide down --

The Alien is feet away --
INCHES...

The door seats itself closed with a solid THUD.

Ripley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden
door.  A beat.
She turns to the room for the first time and finds --


WINDMILLS

Real Man of LaMancha wood and cloth windmills.  Two story high
arms slowly rotating.  Moving enormous volumes of air through
the wind tunnel-like room.  As far as the eye can see.
Turning, creaking.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
But no electronics.  No radio.  No weapons.
This is the Technology Room.

Ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness.  

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SULACO ESCAPE SHIP #4 (DREAM)

Yellow warning lights PULSE.  Those goddamned STROBES are
flickering on and off.  Steam blasts out overhead pipes.

The blue-spark pilot light muzzles of a FLAME THROWER shyly
pokes out from behind a console.  It's owner cautiously
follows...


RIPLEY

She's breathing heavy.
She's wearing a sweat soaked tank top.
Her eyes flit from side to side.  Then up.  Then down.
She pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod.
She silently crosses the distance to Newt's sleep tube:


IN THE TUBE

Newt sleeps peacefully.
Ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers.
Her grip TIGHTENS in the Flame Thrower in her hands.
She flips a switch to HI HEAT.
Moves around the sleep tubes...

A noise to her left.
She WHIRLS --

Pulls the trigger on the flame thrower -- click.  Nothing.
She tries again -- a half-hearted burp, but no flame.
She begins to panic --

Senses the Alien's presence.
Looks left, right, up - no Alien...
Looks down:

The Alien's tail is COMING UP BETWEEN HER LEGS.
She turns --

Right into it's grasp.
The useless flamethrower SKITTERS across the floor.
She PUMMELS the beast with balled up fists.

			RIPLEY
		No.  NO!  I beat you!  I beat you mother
		fucker!!

The Alien spins her -- pushes her over across the sleep tube --
Like it's taking her from behind!

Ripley looks down into the sleep tube:

Newt is gone.
Her doll's head lays in a pool of blood.
The Alien wraps his arms around Ripley.
Thin lips pull back for a kiss.

She SCREAMS.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - REALITY - DAY

Ripley opens her eyes.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
She's still in the room with the windmills.
Somehow this place seems less real than her dream.
She looks around:

John is sitting next to her, writing on a piece of parchment.
He smiles a relieved smile.

			JOHN
		I thought we'd lost you.

			RIPLEY
		What are you writing?

			JOHN
		Last will and testament.
		      (beat)
		Just kidding.

She looks to her left:
Anthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around his
eyes.  His ankle is a swollen mess.  Wires are hanging out.

			RIPLEY
		Is he --?

			JOHN
		Resting.
		      (shakes his head)
		He'll be fine.

			ANTHONY
		No I won't.  He's a terrible liar.

			RIPLEY
		I'm sorry.

			ANTHONY
		It's ironic.  I guess my visions were
		prescience after all.  How will I ever
		resolve that with my artifical con-
		science?

A creaking floorboard to Ripley's right draws her attention to
The Abbot.  He's pacing.

			ABBOT
		Do you see what you've delivered us
		into?

			RIPLEY
		Yeah.  Lead me not into temptation to
		kick your -- ahh --

Ripley tries to stand - her head spins.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		Oh shit.

The entire room THROBS with the rhythm of the wind.

			RIPLEY
		Where is the Big Boy -?

The Abbot points to the door.

			ABBOT
		On the other side of that door.
		Waiting for us to starve to death.

Ripley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface.

			RIPLEY
		It's playing with us.  It could get in
		here any time it wants.

			ABBOT
		Why should he enter?  He knows that one
		of the people in this room is in league
		with him.

			JOHN
		Sir.  We're all in the same coracle, so
		to speak.

			ABBOT
		Maybe more than one of us.

			RIPLEY
		Let's talk about the facts, Mr. Abbot.

She looks at the windmills.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		This is your technology?

			ABBOT
		Even this is forbidden to us.

			RIPLEY
		Well then, the facts are that we're screwed.

She moves into the room.  Walks around one of the Windmills.

			RIPLEY
		An Eco system.  Nothing to recycle your
		atmosphere except the green plants.  Winds
		generated down here --
		     (looks at the floor)
		Windmills use the natural surface winds
		to turn wheels underground, create tides
		on the seas to recirculate your water...

			ANTHONY
		More than that.  There are pumps beneath
		the floor - I can feel their vibration.

			RIPLEY
		Probably pumping this air through charcoal
		filters.

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		It gets colder all the time here, right?

John looks at her questioningly.

			JOHN
		Yes...

			RIPLEY
		Your wood burning fires throw soot into
		the atmosphere, building the cloud layer -
		cutting off the sun's rays - cooling the
		planet, forcing you to burn more wood.

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			ANTHONY
		The Greenhouse Effect.  It's how the Earth
		almost destroyed itself in the late 20th
		century.

			RIPLEY
		Don't you see?  This is a planet set to
		self destruct.  Not in ten minutes or two
		hours but soon.  Your atmosphere here is
		finite.  If the plants die the fires will
		eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid
		will be dead - Everyone will die.

The Abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last 
few meters of a Marathon.

			ABBOT
		It's here.  I was just hoping I would be
		dead long before it came to this.

			JOHN
		What?

			ABBOT
		We're supposed to die here.  That's the point.

			RIPLEY
		Wait a minute -- you were exiled --?

			ABBOT
		The punishment for our crime was death.

Anthony sits up.

			ANTHONY
		This planet is the supreme triumph of
		planned obsolesence.  A certain amount of
		primitive materials with an atmosphere
		processing system as fragile as a real
		environment but not replenishable.

The Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes...

			ABBOT
		Poetic justice for the anti-technologists.
		The Company's best work.  You know, I used
		to be a corporate executive.  Middle range
		V.P.  Then my wife got hit by a speed craft.
		I chucked it all and joined the order.
		Be a monk -- see the world.  Being here,
		being chairman of the board...

			RIPLEY
		No, now I understand why I landed here.
		To join you happy lunatics in your 
		deaths.

Ripley moves away...
John starts after her.

			JOHN
		Ripley, wait --

The Abbot stands, blocks his way.

			ABBOT
		Where can she go?  She's trapped.
		       (beat)
		Trapped inside her own prison.  A prison
		in her mind.  Inside her mind.  Dancing.
		Sparklets of light - dance with the june
		bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare
		coming to danceintheshadowof...

John and Ripley turn to look at the Abbot.
He begins to speak faster.  Faster.
He shakes.  Vibrates is more accurate --
A trickle of BLOOD runs from his left ear...

			ABBOT

SPLORTCH-KT--!!
The Abbot's HEAD EXPLODES --!!!
Like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement.
Blood, bone, hair and brain matter SPRAY John.
John SCREAMS.


A HORRIBLE ALIEN HEAD BURSTER

Is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the Abbot.
It keeps it's hold on the Abbot's spinal cord -- The Abbot's
body continues to stagger around, arms jerking mechanically as
lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way
through the system.

Ripley SCREAMS.
The Infant Alien-headed corpse stumbles towards her --
She plucks Anthony's staff from the floor and SWINGS --
-- Like a child hitting a baseball from a TEE --
WHACK-K -!!
BLASTS the Chest/head burster across the room --

It hits the floor SCRAMBLING.  Scuttles down into where the
Windmills meet the floor.  Disappears.

			RIPLEY
		BASTARD!!  It came out of his fucking
		head!

			ANTHONY
		I didn't have to see that to know what
		that means.

			RIPLEY
		He sent him to us.  That bastard outside.
		I can't get away from him.  He's fucking
		with my mind.  He's my punishment!

			ANTHONY
		I'm confused.  Before you said it came out
		of the torso, not the head --

			RIPLEY
		I don't feel like a discussion of Alien biology.

John comes up next to her.

			JOHN
		Ripley, don't --

She pushes him away and sinks to the floor.

			RIPLEY
		I should just wait for the air to run out...

			JOHN
		I believe - I know - that we can win --
		there is an answer in our books.

			RIPLEY
		Your books?  Your books are gone, Brother.
		Your world is gone.  Once that thing starts
		to lay its eggs, all your brothers - if
		they aren't already - are dead.

			JOHN	
		If that's true, then all of us, the books,
		are consigned to ashes.

He clasps his hands and bows his head.
The Abbot's blood drips off his hands.
Plip - plop!
Into a little puddle at Ripley's feet.
She stares at the blood.  Aahk.
Feels the PAIN again.
Runs her hand across her chest...

			ANTHONY O/S
		Ripley?

			RIPLEY
		What?

			ANTHONY
		There are several inconsistancies between
		this and the other Aliens you described.

			RIPLEY
		Give it up.

			ANTHONY
		I think this is important.  This may help
		us fight it.  The creature that I fought
		in the hall - when I first saw it, it had
		camoflaged itself to look like wood.

Ripley looks up.
			
			RIPLEY
		Wood?  When I saw it in my room it looked
		the way it did before -- black, mechanical --
		unless that was a dream.

			ANTHONY
		I don't think it was.  I think that this 
		creature, if it is the efficient predator
		that you say it is, has the ability to
		adapt to its environment.

			RIPLEY
		Then the reason they've always looked the
		same to me is that I only ever saw them in
		the same environment.

			ANTHONY
		Or this may be an as yet unseen stage of
		development -- you saw a queen -- This
		could be like a King ant -- more highly
		advanced than the drone, bred for 
		survival -?

			JOHN
		How does this explain the thing that came
		out of the ewe's chest?  The Abbot's head?

			RIPLEY
		Maybe it can deposit different types of
		eggs.  The chest burster is probably
		dormant until the host eats - The first
		one I ever saw came out of Kane after he
		started to eat --

And in one horrible moment she realizes:
She hasn't eaten.  The pain in her chest...

			RIPLEY
		No.

Anthony "looks" towards her - does he realize as well?

			JOHN
		No what?

			RIPLEY
		No, we're not beat yet, Father --

			JOHN
		Brother --

Ripley gets up.

			RIPLEY
		Brother.  Not yet.  If he's taunting me,
		then maybe we can use that.  We can beat
		this bastard.  We can get to my ship.
		We can live.

								CUT TO:

INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM

John stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the 
ceiling.  Holds a torch.
Ripley is on the ground with Anthony, his injured leg splayed 
out in front of him.  Skin is palid.

			ANTHONY
		Don't have second thoughts.  Blind and
		crippled I would only slow you down.
		Give him time to figure out what you're
		doing.  Just leave me my staff.

			RIPLEY
		Okay.  Good luck.

She shakes his hand.  He pulls her closer.
Anthony's empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at Ripley.

			ANTHONY
		Ripley, I know.  Good luck.

			RIPLEY
		Sit tight.

Ripley crosses to John.  Poised at the bottom of the ladder they
look up at the trap door on the ceiling.

			RIPLEY
		He could be waiting on the other side
		of that door.  We might not get ten feet
		before he kills the three of us.

He shakes his head.

			JOHN
		We had better go, then.

He smiles.
She smiles back.
They move up the ladder.

It leads up a damp, short shaft, walls GREEN with algae, to


AN UNDERGROUND DOCK - NIGHT

The ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier.  Ripley and John
climb out onto the wooden structure.  Before them:

AN UNDERGROUND SEA stretches the width of the entire planet,
over five miles across.  The floor of the lowest level of the
top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred
feet overhead.

The water sparkles with a golden glow.

			JOHN
		Must be day on the surface of the planet.

			RIPLEY
		Where is the light coming from?
	
			JOHN
		Mirrors.  Reflect the outside light down
		great shafts -- through lenses.  That's
		what they make in the glass factory. 
		Lenses.  Look --

She turns:

A HUGE WATERFALL

Lit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours
into the sea a short distance from them.

			JOHN
		Opens to the surface.  Water flows in
		and out.  I don't know how.  There's one
		at either end.  I came down on the other
		side.

			RIPLEY
		What do we do?

John points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at
the end of their ropes.

			JOHN
		We cross.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DAY

Anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the
bottom of one of the windmills.  He winces as he prods his
tender ankle with the end of his staff.  It SPARKS.
The large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head.
The wind blows through his hair.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
Feels good.

Anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes."

			ANTHONY
		Now the seer can only see what God wants
		him to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks
		and I've finally found religion.

A floor board CREAKS.
Anthony strains to hear:

			ANTHONY
		John?  Ripley?

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
He knows it is not.

			ANTHONY
		Well come then.  I haven't got forever.

A shadow falls across his face.  He can feel it.
He doesn't have to see what is here.


THE UNDERGROUND OCEAN - DAY INTO NIGHT

The leather boat makes its way across the sea.
John rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft.
As night falls she takes the oars.

The Ocean is dead calm.  The coracle glides across the glass-
like surface.  John flexes his scarred fingers.

			RIPLEY
		Your hands okay?

			JOHN
		They'll be fine.  You've been on
		a boat before.

Ripley squints ahead of them.
The ocean seems to go on forever.

			RIPLEY
		I was a warrant officer on a ship --
		but I did all my sailing in space.

			JOHN		
		Father Anselm used to take me on his
		coracle when I was little.

Ripley leans forward - scans his face.

			RIPLEY
		How old were you when they towed
		this satellite out here?	

			JOHN
		Five.  The Abbot said they put us to 
		sleep for the thirty years it took
		to get here.  We've had almost forty
		more.  Until now.

			RIPLEY
		What happened to your mother?

			JOHN
		Never had one.  I mean, never knew her.
		I mean, I did, once.  She left my father
		when he joined the movement.  If she
		hadn't I wouldn't be here.  They kept
		the other children with the women, on
		Earth.  That was too long ago now.  Like
		a dream.

Ripley's face grows strangely dark.  She turns to the water.

			RIPLEY
		Did you know that I was a mother?

			JOHN
		The girl in the ship with -?

			RIPLEY
		No.  On Earth.  I never mentioned my
		daughter.  My daughter.  I have - had
		I guess, by now - a daughter on Earth.
		Kathy.  She was nine when I signed on to
		the Nostromo.  Mommy will be home before
		you know it I said.  My shares would have
		set us up good.  Then I lost sixty years
		floating around in a rescue pod.  Thanks
		to the Alien.  I came home to face a bitter,
		70 year old woman.  My daughter.  A little
		girl who's mother never came home.

			JOHN
		Jesus Christ.

			RIPLEY
		They said I should have been happy to be
		alive.  Funny, huh?  That's why I went
		back the second time.  Not so I could
		fight it -- You can't fight it -- So
		I could let it kill me.

She rubs her chest --

			JOHN
		You didn't choose to get lost in space.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks for the try Father --

			JOHN
		Brother.

			RIPLEY
		Brother, but I'm not looking for absolution.
		I couldn't be a good mother to my daughter.
		I couldn't be a good mother to Newt.  But
		I can be a good mother to you.  I can make
		sure you survive.

Suddenly they feel rain --
Ripley holds out her hand.
Her eyes open wide at what she sees.
John takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side:

The Ocean has become red with BLOOD.
Blood DRIPS down from the ceiling around them.

			RIPLEY
		Blood.

John looks up.

			JOHN
		From the levels above.

His face goes white.

			JOHN
		He must have slaughtered all --

			RIPLEY
		Don't think about it.  Don't think about
		what's up there.  Just row.

As Ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples move
across the surface.
She doesn't notice.


A SHAPE

Passes underneath the boat.  A swimming CREATURE.  The Alien.
Thanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears HUGE.
Dwarfs their coracle.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - NIGHT

All the windmills are BURNING.
Flaming arms lazily turning.
Anthony is not in sight.
Whoosh...Whoosh...


THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN - NIGHT

Another dock with ladders going up and down.
Ripley and John climb out of the coracle.
Don't waste time tying off.  They go  --


UP THE LADDER

A hundred foot climb.  The wood is twisted.
Rungs have been torn away in some places.
They pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest
foothold.  The temperature rises as they do.
Sweat runs into their eyes.

Soon they can see the floor above them:
BLACKENED by intense heat.
They climb.


INT. UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELDS - NIGHT

Ripley and John come up from the level below.

			RIPLEY
		Holy shit.

John crosses himself.

Another testament to the terrible battle with the Alien.
Reduced to just a huge, blackened floor.
All the crops burned to ash --
Their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted Monks.
Their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead --
Ripley would puke if she had any food in her body.

			JOHN
		There's Andrew.  And Raphael.  Peter...

			RIPLEY
		Stop.  How far?

			JOHN
		We're right below the Abbey now.

They cross the smoldering field.
The scorched floor threatens to give way under John's feet --
Ripley pull him to one side.


THE MONASTERY LEVEL

Heaven has become HELL.
The ground, the buildings, the Sky-timber - all blackened.
FIRES burn everywhere.  Air choked with gray smoke and dust
pouring in from the Orbiter's surface through rends in the
vaulted ceiling.


RIPLEY AND JOHN

Climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's 
hinges.  They look at the grim tableau:

Monks impaled on their own pikes.
Tangled together in their own pungy stakes.
Alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies.


THE MONASTERY

Flickering fires lit the first few floor windows.
Ripley takes a step towards it --
Reaches back and pulls John...


INT. GLASS FACTORY - NIGHT

The Glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow.
Small fires burn out of control around the room.
Finished glass pieces BURST from the heat.
Ripley and John enter.

			JOHN
		This is the glassworks.  They have
		tools here --
			(spots)
		Kyle --

He runs across the room --


BROTHER KYLE

Sits calmly at the Marver table.
He places playing cards on the table in front of him.
Solitaire.  
He sings to himself quietly.

			KYLE
		     (sotto)
		Can't see my baby.
		Don't see my baby.  Bay be.

John grabs him by the lapels - pulls him to his feet.
The playing cards fall to the floor --
Kyle watches them, not John.

			JOHN
		Kyle.  Brother Kyle.

			KYLE
		Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup.
		Black king on red queen, put the
		ace up --

John SHAKES him.

			JOHN
		Kyle goddammit!

Ripley moves closer.

			RIPLEY
		John - it's too late --

Kyle begins to sing faster.  Faster.

			KYLE
		Ace up.  Put the ace up.  Redaceupup.
		Blackaceup.Up.Pup-pup-pup-chaka-
		boomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma
		looma --

Ripley and John look at each other.
They know what this means.
John pulls a length of rope off a nearby table.
Moves in front of Kyle.  Looks into his glassy eyes.
A tear runs down his cheek.

			JOHN
		Keep singing, my friend.

John loops the rope around Kyle's neck.
Strangles him.
Eases the lifeless body to the floor.
Stares at it.


RIPLEY

Pulls a blowing iron from the rack.  Feels its weight and
balance.  A reasonable weapon.  She crosses to John.

			JOHN
		I killed him.  I'm a doctor and I
		killed him.

			RIPLEY
		You had to.  You're supposed to end
		suffering.

She hands him a pontil, a pointed iron spear used to form the
molten glass shapes.

			RIPLEY
		Let's get the hell out of here.


INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Ripley and John move up the stairs.
Flickering orange lit from below.
Smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors.


INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

They enter carefully.  The room is exactly as John left it,
books out of shelves, hanging on their chains.

			RIPLEY
		He's made a mess.

John pushes ahead of her.

			JOHN
		No.  He hasn't been up here yet.  I 
		did this.

He moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open
the lock --

			JOHN
		Here - philosophy - we'll start here --

AAAROO --!
A HAIRY BLUR flies out from between the stacks --
WHUMPH!  Knocks John to the floor --
Licks his face.

			JOHN
		Mattias!

The happy dog leaps all over his master.

			JOHN		
		He waited.  Ripley, this is Mattias.  My
		dog.  Good fellow.

Ripley crosses to them.

			RIPLEY
		I'm glad.  Really.  But we've probably
		only got a few minutes before this
		entire place goes up in flames.  Just
		grab whatever books you want and --

Ripley leans in to pet Mattias.
Mattias draws his lip back.  Growls.
He's looking over Ripley's shoulder.

She turns around slowly...


THE ALIEN

Standing in the open doorway.
It's in bad shape from the man traps.
Lost a foot.  Tongue hanging out, useless.
Parts of it look like wood.  Parts of it look like wheat.

It carries Anthony's waterlogged, limp body --
POPS off his head like a grape from the bunch.
Tosses the corpse at Ripley's feet.

I could swear it's trying to smile.


RIPLEY AND JOHN

Back against the book stacks.
John grabs Mattias' collar.
The Dog GROWLS at the Alien intruder...

			JOHN
		Easy, boy...

			RIPLEY
		Is there another way out?

			JOHN
		Not that will do us any good.


THE ALIEN

Limps into the room dragging one foot.
It's breathing is labored.  Dripping acid blood leaves a thin
trail of fire behind it.

			JOHN
		We hurt it.

The Alien draws itself up to its full height --
Even wounded it is one dangerous mother fucker.

			RIPLEY
		You wanna give it a bandage?  Look --
		Where is my ship from here?

			JOHN
		On the roof directly above this room.

			RIPLEY
		Here's the plan --
		
			JOHN
		But the books --

			RIPLEY
		Forget the books!

RUFF!!
Mattias pulls free from John's grasp --
Runs to the Alien --

			RIPLEY
		Shit.


MATTIAS

Snaps and barks at the Alien --
Leaping about to dodge its claws.
Draws its attention --


RIPLEY AND JOHN

RUN at the Alien.
It is trying to spear the dog with its tail.
John swings the iron rod -- THWAP -!
HITS the Alien across the back of its bulbous head --

It turns to him --

SPLIIIITCH -!
Ripley SHOVES the blowing iron into the Alien's torso.
His acid blood SPURTS out the end of the hollow tube --
SPLATTERS Ripley's cassock - she TEARS it off --

John grabs Mattias -- pulls him back.

The Alien SPINS in a circle --
Blood SPRAYING around him -

Creating a CIRCLE OF FIRE about him --
IGNITING the books --

			JOHN
		No!  THE BOOKS!!

			RIPLEY
		Don't --!

John steps forward -- Ripley grabs for him --
The ACID EATS through the wooden floor --


THE FLOOR COLLAPSES

The Alien, John and Ripley PLUMMET down -!
THROUGH the next floor --


INTO THE GLASSWORKS

The Alien FALLS into the molten glass vat --
SCREECHES - arms flailing as it sinks beneath the surface of
the thousand degree liquid.


JOHN

Finds himself HANGING over the bubbling glass vat - Caught -
DANGLING on the Flying Fox rope.  Five feet away - the ledge the
Flying Fox is launched from.  He looks down:

He can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him.  To its
right, the Water DUMP TANK - a large wine cask-looking affair
where finished pieces are cooled.  He looks up:

Ripley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above.

			JOHN
		Are you all right?

Ripley grunts an affirmative response.
At least is she falls, it will only be a twenty-foot drop to
the floor.  John is looking at instant par-boiling.
John starts to move hand over hand UP the rope.  He begins to
sweat.
A drop of sweat falls...
HSSS!
POPS AND SIZZLES as it hits the surface of the molten glass --


RIPLEY

Tries to pull herself up to the floor above --
The next level is a raging fire.

She can only hang and DROP.  She DOES -!
Falls the two stories.
Bends her knees and ROLLS on impact.


JOHN

Has reached the ledge overlooking the furnace.
He stands.  Sees Ripley slowly rising --

			JOHN
		Ripley -!

Ripley shakily gets to her feet.
Hops on one foot.

			RIPLEY
		Aargh.  I'm fine.  Let's get the fuck
		out of --

SUDDENLY

THE ALIEN'S head breaks the surface of the molten glass.
SCREAMING.  STEAMING.  It is white-hot -
translucent -- covered with -- 
It looks like MOLTEN GLASS!!

Hook-like hands grasp the edge of the tank --
It tries to climb out --

Ripley turns to run.  Tender ankle gives out.
She falls face down on the floor --
Rolls over --

THE ALIEN is going to climb out of the vat --
She SCREAMS --


JOHN

Grabs the Flying Fox handle.
SWINGS down the rope - across the room --
PAST the Alien --

It turns away from Ripley -
She scrambles across the floor...

John lands HARD.
Points --

			JOHN
		Ripley - the lever!!

Ripley looks next to her:  a burning wooden lever.

The Alien has one foot out of the glass furnace --

RIPLEY grabs the lever -- Hssssst!
Putting out the fire with her hand --
Pulls --


THE HUGE DUMP TANK OF WATER

DUMPS.  Empties a thousand gallons --
RAINS DOWN on the Alien. 
It HOWLS in pain --

The Molten Glass instantly COOLS --
The rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to
BE-THWOOOoooOOM -!!
EXPLODE into a million pieces...!!!!

Ripley helps John off the floor.
They are battered.  Bloody.
They look into the vat.
The steam clears...

The room is littered with Alien Bits.
Each piece is encased in glass --
Trapped like a fly in amber.

			JOHN
		Saw that happen to a bottle once.

			RIPLEY
		    (panting)
		Beat... Beat him - ugh --

She grabs her stomach as her knees give out.
John gives her an arm for support.

			JOHN
		We've got to get to the Library --

			RIPLEY
		Don't worry.  Ship.  Just --

They look up:

Mattias looks down through the hole in the floor.
BARKS...


INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

An INFERNO.
Every bookshelf ablaze.  The floor dotted with pools of flame.
Ripley and John are at the door - held back by the heat --

John tries to enter the room --
Ripley grabs him --

			RIPLEY
		Don't be stupid --

			JOHN
		Some of them!  I've got to save some of
		them!  Mattias!!

Mattias yelps in response.  Threads his way through to them.
Ripley spins him to face her.  Tears stream down his cheeks.

			RIPLEY
		They're lost.  You did your best.  If
		you get out, it wasn't in vain.
		We've got to live!!

She YANKS him into the hallway --

							CUT TO:

EXT. MONASTERY - THE ROOF - NIGHT

Ripley's good foot KICKS down the burning planks that surround
the escape ship.  John and Mattias stand behind as she climbs
through to the ship.  John looks around:

The ABBEY LEVEL is devastated.  The air is filled with smoke.
The Abbey is burning.  The Library is in flames.

John looks down at his medical bag.
Torn, bloody, scorched, it still hangs from his shoulders.
Inside: The only remaining book.

			RIPLEY O/S
		Come on in!

John and Mattias step through --


INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 - NIGHT

Ripley CLICKS on the lights.
John lifts Mattias into the hatch.

			JOHN
		The Library --

			RIPLEY
		I told you -- the Earth is still there --

Ripley checks an instrument:  Elapsed travel time.
Her brows knit.  She TAPS the gauge.

			RIPLEY
		Not working.

			JOHN
		What does that mean?

			RIPLEY
		It means I don't know how long I was
		in hyper sleep.

			JOHN
		It means the Abbot could've been right --
		
			RIPLEY
		It means my clock isn't working.  We have
		to get out of here.  Even if he was right
		this ship's onboard computer is filled 
		with man's knowledge.

			JOHN
		Not everything.  Some things will be
		lost forever. 

			RIPLEY
		Then man starts over.  He's done it
		before.

She pushes a few buttons.  Somewhere under the floor a 
propulsion source HUMS to life.  THROBBING through the soles
of John's feet.  Ripley is absorbed in her work.

			RIPLEY
		Okay.  The seals weren't broken so
		we're probably clear.  But those dead
		monks out there are going to start
		hatching soon.  Let's get ready to
		take off.

			JOHN
		What can I do?

			RIPLEY
		Here, I need a compressor tank from
		in that compartment.

She motions towards an open door.
John enters the compartment.
Whoosh-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

			JOHN
		Hey!  What?!

He looks out the window in the door.  

Ripley is staring at him, punching keys on a pad next to the
door.

			JOHN
		Hey - I'm locked in.

Mattias scratches at the door.

			RIPLEY
		I know.  I locked you in.

			JOHN
		What?

			RIPLEY
		I'm not going with you.  I've got one
		inside me.
	
			JOHN
		What?!  You can't --

She runs a hand across her midsection.

			RIPLEY
		I figured it out.  That's why it didn't
		kill me.  He must have impregnated me
		when I was in the stasis tube.
		    (remembers nightmare)
		It hasn't come out yet because I 
		haven't eaten, It's still dormant.  So
		either I eat and it kills me or I don't
		eat and I starve to death.  Either way 
		I die.

John pulls the Medieval Tome out of his medical bag.

			JOHN	
		My book -- I know what to do --

			RIPLEY
		What, an exorcism?  No good.

			JOHN
		You can't do this.  Ripley - listen
		to me - you're confusing feeling of
		guilt for actual sin - I can help you --

			RIPLEY
		    (ignoring)
		I've set a time lock.  When the pod escapes
		the Colony's gravitational pull this
		compartment will open.  Then all you have 
		to do is get into the Stasis tube with
		Mattias and press the blue button.  With
		any luck a freighter or something will
		pick you up.  Good luck.

He pounds his fists against the door.

			JOHN
		NO!  No, Goddammit - you can't do this.
		You can't let it win.

She turns away from the door.

			RIPLEY
		It always wins.  We killed it, but it's
		still inside me -- You're my last chance.
		If I can keep you alive it'll make up
		for all those I've lost.

			JOHN
		Listen to me!  You have to let me try!
		Ripley:  You're MY only chance!

She's listening...

			JOHN
		I told you Father Anselm raised me.
		He raised me and when he was dying I
		couldn't do anything to save him.  I 
		didn't know enough.  It was my fault
		he died.  If you don't let me try to
		save you my body will live but my soul
		will be dead.

Ripley turns and stares at him.

			JOHN
		Please.

								CUT TO:


THE PAGE

A MEDIEVAL ETCHING.
A Monk vomits up the devil.

Pull back as John lowers Ripley to the pod floor.
John closes his eyes.
Closes the book.

He pours some water into a small plastic cup.
Retrieves a small pouch of herbs.  Opens it.
Wrinkles his nose - they smell --
pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup.

			RIPLEY
		What is this stuff?

			JOHN
		     (forceful)
		Something that will make you well.
		Something that will make you sick.

			RIPLEY
		I don't --

			JOHN
		Shut up and drink.

He lifts the back of Ripley's head --
FORCES the drink down her throat.

John swings his leg over her midsection.  STRADDLES her.
Presses his two hands together in prayer.
Then balls them into one fist.
Takes a deep, preparatory breath...

Ripley starts to GAG -- Cough.
Her body starts to JERK --

John BRINGS HIS FIST DOWN INTO HER STOMACH --
WHAMM -!!

Ripley CONVULSES -- has the dry heaves --

WHAM!  WHAM --!
John PUMMELS Ripley's diaphragm!

She sputters -- VOMITS a thick mucous-like substance --
HEAVES --

Ripley's back arches --
She SCREAMS a gut wrenching WAIL --
Her torso BULGES as the creature is forced upwards.

John BEARS down --
Pushes UP under her ribs --
FORCING the chest-burster up her throat --

Ripley fights for air as the alien STOPS halfway up her 
esophagus -- She's choking --

John crosses himself -- takes a deep breath --
Lowers his mouth to hers --
Inhales.  Exhales.  CPR.


THE ALIEN CHEST BURSTER

SLITHERS out of Ripley's mouth --

INTO JOHN'S!!
Reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet.

John falls back against a computer console.
Gagging.  Fights to speak.

Ripley raises herself up on one elbow.
Alien mucous drooling down her chin.
Hair matted against her forehead.

			RIPLEY
		Why?
	
			JOHN
		Choking.  It was the only way.

He drops the open book in front of her:
She sees the etching.


JOHN

Gulps back the oozing slime.
Struggles to his feet.

			JOHN
		They knew.

			RIPLEY
		But you --

Ripley tries to stand - to go after him --
She can't sit up -- feels like a rib might be cracked.

			RIPLEY
		You'll die --

John stumbles to the Pod door.  Turns back.

			JOHN	
		That's idea.  Join...my brothers.  If
		we were right, Heaven.  If we were wrong --
		either way, where we belong.  World of
		books.  Pages.

He draws the parchment out of his bag.
Drops it to the floor.

			JOHN
		You... are from the real world.

He starts to step through the door --
Mattias tries to follow.

			JOHN
		Stay -- both of you.

He exits the Pod.

Ripley drags herself across the floor.

			RIPLEY
		No - wait!  John!

To the Door.  Looks out:


BROTHER JOHN

Dawn's rays are peeking through the battered ceiling as he
walks slowly across the smoking roof.
Into the inferno that is the burning Abbey.

Ripley watches as John and the alien horror inside him are
INCINERATED.

The heat of the flames grows.
She must pull back --
Reaches up for the door handle.
It closes with a THUD.

She rolls onto her back.
She weeps.  For the first time in years.
She's been absolved.

CREeeek -!!
The escape pod SHIFTS.
Ripley's eyes SNAP open --

The Roof beneath the Pod is beginning to GIVE WAY.

Ripley rolls onto her stomach and drags herself to the
pilot's chair.  Pulls herself into the seat.
Straps herself in --


SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4

Blasts THROUGH the wooden outershell of the Orbiter Arceon.
ROARS towards us - past us.


INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 = DAY

Ripley places Mattias into the Hyper sleep tube.
Rubs under his chin.  Is about to climb in with him when she
spots something on the floor --


JOHN'S PARCHMENT

Ripley picks it up and unrolls it.
She hears John's voice:

			JOHN V.O.
		I, Brother John Goldman of the orbiter
		Arceon, Minorite abbey and gaol, know
		the Abbot was wrong.  There is a great
		evil here.  I have seen it.  I put pen to
		paper now lest this plague - this creature
		stills my hand.  I have gone down below -
		both to try to warn the others and get 
		the woman - Ripley - get from her some
		clue as to how to battle this evil, or
		at least to make my peace for not
		defending her.  She believes there is
		still and Earth and I hope she is right.
		I hope she will be able to find out.
		I hope she can find some rest for the
		devils that torment her.

Ripley looks at the elapsed time counter on the command
console.  Pulls a pen from it's holder.  She adds:

			RIPLEY V.O.
		Whether the Earth exists or not, whether
		we end up in Heaven, or Hell, or the cold
		vacuum of space, she has.

She sets her course.
Gets back into her tube.
Closes the lid.


DEEP SPACE

The escape pod moves through the jet-black void...


ARCEON

Dwindles into the darkness behind her, a smouldering, slowly
dying ember...

Something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun-
     tains of Tennessee, and the camera takes its point of
     view. Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view
     allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the
     forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small
     shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth
     oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by
     this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash.



2    ED - CAR


     Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of
     a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other
     peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be
     heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving
     away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap-
     pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a
     dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view.



3    ID - CAR


     Inside, five people can be seen. They are couples ASHLY
     and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister.
     Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear "Michigan State" T-shirts,
     and are students along with the others at that univer-
     sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up
     front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen
     to an old "Baby Moses And The Thrillers" song on the
     radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it
     were a drum.


                             SHELLY

               (Singing with the music)... Together,
               forever...


                             SCOTT

               Ash, where are we?


                             ASHLY

               I'll tell ya in a second. Now we're
               still on seventy-five just past the
               county border...



4    ED - W


     Once again, the camera takes the point of view of the
     dark and brooding force which stops atop a forest ridge
     to peer downward. Its view focuses upon the 1973 Olds-
     mobile speeding along the narrow highway below.



5    ID - CAR


     ASHLY traces a route on the map with his finger.


                             ASHLY

               ...Which would put us...which would
               put us...


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ, just tell us already
               will ya?


     ASHLY zeroes in on the map with his finger.


                             ASHLY

               ...Right...


     SCOTT is growing impatient.


                             ASHLY

               ...Right...


                             SCOTT

               Yes?


                             ASHLY

               Here!


     Suddenly, the radio stops, and the steering wheel jerks
     from SCOTT's hand.



6    ED - CAR


     The car screetches out of control into the opposite lane.
     A large oncoming tanker truck with its horn screaming
     races toward the car on a collision coarse.



7    ID - CAR


                             SHELLY

               Scotty, watch out!



8    ED - CAR


     The truck races closer.



9    ID - CAR


     Their steering wheel is locked.


                             ASHLY

               Turn!



10   ED - CAR


     At the last possible instant, SCOTT's wheel again can
     be controlled, and the car swerves sharply back into its
     own lane.



11   ED - CAR


     The truck speeds harmlessly past them.



12   ID - CAR


                             ASHLY

               Damn it Scott, what the hell was that?
               You trying to kill us?


                             SCOTT

               Don't yell at me, it's your lousy
               steering wheel. The damn thing jerked
               right out of my hand.


                             ASHLY

               I can't understand it. I just had
               this thing in for a tune-up.


                             SHELLY

               Radio's dead too, ace.


                             ASHLY

               And I just had 'em tune up the whole
               thing yesterday.


                             SCOTT

               Well, then take it back 'cause the
               damn thing don't work. Only thing
               that works on the whole car is the
               lousy horn.


     SCOTT honks the horn.



13   ED - CAR


     Several local MEN walking down the highway respond to
     the horn by waving.



14   ID - CAR


     SCOTT yells out the window at them.


                             SCOTT

               Aw, go to hell, I'm not waving at ya!


     He looks in the rear view mirror. The MEN are still wav-
     ing in the distance. SCOTT turns back to drive.


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ.


     SHELLY turns around in the front seat and holds up a
     pint of Scotch.


                             SHELLY

               Well, I'd like to make a toast. To
               Scott who almost killed us.


                             SCOTT

               Aw, eat shit and die will ya?


     SHELLY and the others laugh.


                             SHELLY

               Okay, okay- then to a wild week-end
               in a wonderful cabin with good friends,
               (She glances at SCOTT) provided we
               live that long.


     SHELLY cooly drinks from the Scotch and passes the bottle
     back to ASHLY and LINDA. ASHLY pours LINDA a drink in the
     bottle cap and keeps the bottle. They raise their drinks.


                         ASHLY and LINDA

               ...With good friends.


     They toast, drink and react to the strong liquor. ASHLY
     tries to hide his reaction to the Scotch in front of
     LINDA, since SHELLY had reacted so calmly. ASHLY passes
     the bottle to CHERYL who stops him with a polite "No,
     thank you," then back up front to SCOTT.


                             LINDA

               Hey Scotty, what's this place like
               anyway?


                             SCOTT

               Well, the guy that's renting it says
               it's an old place, little run down,
               but it's right up in the mountains-
               totally secluded. (He takes a drink
               from the bottle) Best part is, we
               get it so cheap.


                             LINDA

               Why are we getting it so cheap?


                             SCOTT

               I don't know, might be in real bad
               shape.


                             CHERYL

               You mean nobody's seen this place
               yet?


                             SCOTT

               Not yet.


                             ASHLY

               Might not be too bad.


                             LINDA

               No...


                             ASHLY

               Actually, it might be very nice.


                             LINDA

               Yeah...


                             SHELLY

               It's probably a real pit.


                             CHERYL

               I can't believe that we're renting
               a place for a week-end that nobody's
               seen.


                             SCOTT

               (Mumbling to himself) Jesus Christ,
               not this again...


                             CHERYL

               (Turning to ASHLY) You know, mom and
               dad would never let us go up to a place
               like this if they knew-


                             ASHLY

               -Which is exactly why they don't know.
               I'll tell you who I am gonna call.
               The guys that fixed up this car.



15   ED - CAR


     The car approaches an exit along the highway.



16   ID - CAR


     ASHLY glances at the map again.


                             ASHLY

               Hey, I think this is where we get
               off.



17   ED - CAR


     The car turns off the main highway and follows several
     back roads until it approaches a narrow dirt lane that
     winds upward along a twin set of mountains.



18   ID - CAR


     SCOTT glances up to the peaks.


                             SCOTT

               These mountains seem familiar.


                             LINDA

               What do they remind you of? Some-
               thing majestic? Adventure?


                             SCOTT

               Yeah, more like adventure.


                             LINDA

               Any adventure in particular?


                             SCOTT

               Shelly's sweater.


     ASHLY and SCOTT laugh out loud. LINDA laughs quietly,
     and CHERYL lets out an embarassed giggle to herself.


                             SHELLY

               (Teasing) Oooh, you're gonna get it
               Scotty, when you least expect it,
               you're gonna get it good.



19   ED - B


     Finally, the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending
     over a great chasm. Carefully, the vehicle crosses.



20   ED - CAB


     It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their
     destination. The small wooden cabin is surrounded by
     thick dark woods. SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin-
     ues to sputter and backfire.



21   ID - CAR


     ASHLY reacts to his car.


                             ASHLY

               I...I sent 'em a check for the tune-up.
               but I'm just not paying for it.


                             LINDA

               This place is perfect.


                             CHERYL

               The woods come awfully close to the
               house don't they?


                             SCOTT

               So what's wrong with the woods, they
               can't bite ya.


                             CHERYL

               It's just a little claustrophobic
               that's all.


                             LINDA

               Well, I think it's beautiful.


                             SHELLY

               Me too, it's gonna be a bomb week-
               end.



22   ED - CAB


     SCOTT moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds
     a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the
     door. ASHLY unloads the car to the others.


                             SCOTT

               It's supposed to be one of these on
               here.


     After trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door.



23   ID - M.R.


     The interior of the cabin is completely dark. SCOTT
     opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway
     for a moment, then enters to find the light switch.
     The illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings
     made of cedar. There are two small bedrooms, a kitchen,
     and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set
     into the wall. An old grandfather clock stands silently
     in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. A door
     in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed
     containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon
     the wall. Located centrally in the main room is a trap
     door leading to the cellar. This catches SCOTT's eye.


                             SCOTT

               Hey, this place has a dungeon.


     CHERYL puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over
     to SCOTT by the trap door. He unlocks a chain securing
     the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring
     to SHELLY.


                             SCOTT

               Put these back will you?


     SHELLY leaves with the keys, and SCOTT tries to open the
     hatch but cannot.


                             SCOTT

               They nailed it shut.


                             CHERYL

               Good, I don't like cellars. Probably
               just some garbage down there anyways.


                             SCOTT

               Cheryl, they don't nail garbage in
               cellars. I mean it's not going to
               try and get out or anything.


                             CHERYL

               Well, what's down there?


                             SCOTT

               Well, could be any number of things.
               Old baseball cards, mushrooms, dead
               bodies-


                             LINDA

               Hey, look at this!


     LINDA is standing in the corner next to the old grand-
     father clock. She repositions a balance weight, and it
     begins to tick.


                             LINDA

               Ta daaaaaa!


     The others applaud and whistle. LINDA smiles.



24   ET - CAB


     The cabin is seen from the outside. Twilight has come.



25   IT - M.R.


     CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She
     is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the
     ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil
     and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor-
     ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust-
     ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can
     see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re-
     mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the
     room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale
     white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably.
     She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some
     unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch
     a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open
     window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the
     drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now
     retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale
     cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks
     up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some
     form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched.
     She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping
     of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns
     to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos-
     sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it.
     Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from
     the cellar.



26   IT - K/M.R.


     ASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen. ASHLY is drink-
     ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL. He stands between
     her and the trap door.


                             ASHLY

               What're you drawing Cheryl?


     He picks up the piece of paper. LINDA looks over his
     shoulder to glance at it.


                             CHERYL

               I...I don't know.


                             ASHLY

               Is it a bible?


                             CHERYL

               No, no it's no bible. (She glances
               again at the cellar, knowing some-
               thing is down there) I don't know
               what it is.


                             LINDA

               Well, this one of the clock's not
               bad.


     LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock
     with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to
     the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY. She
     is only a few inches from the trap door, and CHERYL
     wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front
     of her to speak secretly.


                             ASHLY

               (In a whisper) I got it right here.


     He taps something in his shirt pocket. CHERYL is looking
     past him paying no attention. She watches only LINDA's
     feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them.
     LINDA looks at the drawing in comparison.


                             LINDA

               Cheryl, this is really good. I like
               how you did the numbers in that wood-
               ish style.


     ASHLY produces a small box from his shirt and opens it
     quickly to show CHERYL. It contains a gold pendant on
     a necklace. LINDA takes a step closer to the clock. She
     is now standing almost upon the trap door. Although
     nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with
     it. CHERYL gasps. ASHLY is pleased with her response.


                             ASHLY

               (Still in a whisper) I knew you'd
               like it.


     Quickly, he places it back in his shirt and touches his
     lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup-
     rise. LINDA returns with the sketch and places it back
     on CHERYL's small drawing table.


                             LINDA

               It's really good Cheryl. Very close
               to the origional.


                             CHERYL

               (In a relieved whisper) Yes, very
               close.


                             LINDA

               I'm gonna check dinner.


     LINDA returns to the kitchen and ASHLY turns to CHERYL.


                             ASHLY

               You better get washed up. I'll see
               ya in there.


     He winks, then follows LINDA into the kitchen. CHERYL
     again looks at the cellar. Slowly, from her point of
     view, the camera moves in toward the trap door, wait-
     ing...waiting.



27   IT - K


     A blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen.
     SHELLY shuts it off and carries it to the dining room.



28   IT - D.R.


     She joins the others who are now seated at the dinner
     table and serves the mixture. SCOTT sits between LINDA
     and CHERYL. He leans over to CHERYL.


                             SCOTT

               (In a whisper) Dead bodies in the
               cellar, dead bodies in the cellar...


                             CHERYL

               Will you stop it?


                             LINDA

               Scott, leave her alone will ya?


     SCOTT turns toward LINDA.


                             SCOTT

               Will you relax, I'm just kidding
               around. She can take a joke-


     He stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. He
     turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass of water in
     his lap. The others laugh. SCOTT is silent for a moment,
     then begins chuckling to himself. He turns to CHERYL.


                             SCOTT

               (Jokingly) I'll get ya.


     With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants.


                             SCOTT

               I'll get ya for this Cheryl.


     ASHLY stands with his drink and raises the glass.


                             ASHLY

               I'd like to make a toast for all
               here this evening. As a greek friend
               of mine once said, "Nis-hat-nis-fert-
               dis-ruben-tu-tar-im."


                             LINDA

               Which means?


                             SCOTT

               Party down!


     The laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of
     wood heard from the main room.


                             SCOTT

               What the hell...


     All stand from the table and hurry to the main room.



29   IN - M.R.


     The nails that held down the trap door have been ripped
     out, and although still in tact, the hatch is wide open.
     They stand silently in front of it, looking blank as to
     what could have done this. CHERYL is slighly more nervous
     than the others. ASHLY is the first to speak.


                             ASHLY

               (Slowly) What is this?


                             SCOTT

               Whatever it is, it's still down there.


                             CHERYL

               I don't like cellars, let's close it
               up. (She does not want to deal with
               it) It's probably just some animal.


                             SCOTT

               An animal?! An an...ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-
               that's the stupidest thing I ever
               heard in my life. Jesus Christ.


     SCOTT locates a flashlight and peers into the hole. He
     traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light.


                             LINDA

               Maybe it is just some animal.


                             SCOTT

               Yeah, probably right. It's probably
               just some animal. Uh...Cheryl, why
               don't you make sure.


     He hands the flashlight to CHERYL who quickly gives it
     back.


                             CHERYL

               Scotty, I'm not going down there!


                             SCOTT

               Okay, okay you cowards, I'll go.


                             LINDA

               Scotty don't. You're crazy if you
               go down there. Why don't you wait
               until morning.


                             SCOTT

               Look, I'll be all right.


                             SHELLY

               What melodrama! What courage! A kiss
               my brave hero.


     SCOTT kisses SHELLY and with flashlight in hand, he descends
     the narrow steps into the cellars blackness.


                             SHELLY

               I, your virgin queen eagerly await
               the precious moment when you will
               ascend.


                             SCOTT

               Virgin queen?! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     He disappears below the floor. SHELLY, CHERYL, LINDA and
     ASHLY wait above.


                             ASHLY

               (Calling down) Hey Scott, see any-
               thing?


     There is no answer.


                             ASHLY

               Hey Scott!...Scott!


                             SHELLY

               He's just kidding around.


     There is silence.


                             SHELLY

               Isn't he?


     No sounds come from the cellar.


                             ASHLY

               Linda, get me a flashlight.


                             LINDA
               That's the only one we brought up.


     ASHLY spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle.


                             ASHLY

               Then get that lantern.


     LINDA brings it over. ASHLY opens the kerosene valve,
     lights the wick, and descends into the basement.



30   IN - C


     Down below, ASHLY moves quietly past the old stone walls
     and wooden beams which support the main floor above. In
     front of him stands an old door which leads to another
     section of the cellar. Cautiously, he moves toward it.
     Before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with
     a moan. ASHLY moves through the doorway and deeper into
     the cellar. Condensation from water pipes above turn the
     cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow
     pools on the dirt floor below. As ASHLY scans with his
     light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye.


                             ASHLY

               Scott?


     ASHLY breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from
     the area where the shadow passed. He backs sqarely into
     a pair of arms which grab him.


                             ASHLY

               Ahhhhhhh!


     It is only SCOTT behind him.


                             ASHLY

               What the hell are you doing down
               here, jerkin' off? How come you
               didn't answer me?


                             SCOTT

               When?


                             ASHLY

               Just now, I mean upstairs.


                             SCOTT

               I didn't hear you.


                             ASHLY

               Oh well, did you find anything?


                             SCOTT

               Uh-uh.


                             ASHLY

               What's this?


     SCOTT sweeps his light to another corner and reveals
     several items atop a small table. Beneath a dusty cloth,
     he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort
     of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the
     cover. Along with this book, SCOTT and ASHLY uncover
     a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and
     other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells.

     It is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin.



32   IN - M.R.


     The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking
     quietly about school. The same bottle of Scotch is passed
     around. ASHLY is rewinding the tape recorder, and once
     this is done, he turns it on. The voice of an old man
     is heard. ASHLY turns to the others who are talking.


                             ASHLY

               Shhh, listen to this.


                             VOICE

               My name is Julian Knowby. I am a pro-
               fessor of ancient Egyptian mythology
               in Dextin university's ancient history
               department...


                             ASHLY

               This is the tape I found downstairs.


                             VOICE

               (Continuing)...I am recording this
               entry from a small cabin in the south-
               ern mountains of Tennessee. Here, I am
               staying with my wife for a few weeks
               so that I may continue my research un-
               disturbed. Since May, a group of assoc-
               iate professors and myself have been
               excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I
               believe I have made an important find
               in that area, and thus the reason for
               this log. With it, I can keep an ac-
               curate record of translations from
               my latest find; the first of six, the
               others still lost, volumes of ancient
               Sumarian burial practices and rites.
               Basically, it is a book of do's and
               don'ts dealing with the deceased en-
               titled "Naturan Demanto" roughly trans-
               lated "Book Of The Dead." It is bound
               in human flesh, and inked with blood
               of the deceased...


                             SCOTT

               Jeez, I'd hate to find out what they
               used for pens.


                             VOICE

               (Continuing)...This particular volume
               deals with demons and demon resurrect-
               ion. These are of the Katardi family,
               meaning those forces believed to inhab-
               it the jungles and woods of man's do-
               main. The first few pages that I have
               translated warn that these demons are
               dangerous, everpresent, and exist
               primarily through this book. As legend
               has it, only the sacred high priests
               of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess
               these books, for they alone could
               properly control the resurrected de-
               mons. It is only through the act of
               reciting the resurrection passage
               that these demons would be able to
               posess the living. For many years, it
               was thought that this legend-


     CHERYL turns off the machine at this point.


                             SCOTT

               Hey, what'd you do that for? It was
               just getting good.


                             CHERYL

               I just don't want to hear any more
               that's all.


                             SCOTT

               (Singing) Cheryl's scared, Cheryl's
               scared.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, leave her alone will ya?


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ.


     He moves to the tape recorder and fast forewards it for
     a bit then stops.


                             SCOTT

               She's acting like a baby- it's no
               big deal.


     He turns the machine on. The passage continues.

     ASHLY, hearing her for the first time, turns from the
     window to CHERYL. She is overwhealmed with fear.

               Kanda!

               Shut it offffff!


     The window shatters when a branch from a nearby tree
     tears through it. ASHLY runs to the tape recorder and
     turns it off. CHERYL is crying now, and runs to her room.
     ASHLY turns to SCOTT.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, you knew not to play it, I
               mean...I mean you knew it was upset-
               ting her. You just don't know when
               you're carrying something too far.


                             SCOTT

               (To SHELLY) C'mon. (Back to ASHLY)
               Big deal, it's just a joke, shit.


     SCOTT and SHELLY head for their bedroom. SCOTT mumbles
     to himself along the way.


                             SCOTT

               You'd think she's three years old or
               something.


     SCOTT slams the door behind him. ASHLY sighs. He moves
     to the broken window and reaches through it to close
     the outside shutters.


                             LINDA

               He's really been bothering you hasn't
               he?


     ASHLY walks to a chair near the other window.


                             ASHLY

               No. It's not Scott. Scotty's okay.
               It's just that ever since we came
               up here, things have been a little
               too tense. (He sits) All these crazy
               things going on. And look at that
               window- we're gonna have to pay for
               that window now.


                             LINDA

               It'll be better tomorrow. Things'll
               smooth out, you'll see.


                             ASHLY

               I hope so.


     He looks at LINDA lovingly for a long moment.


                             ASHLY

               What'ya say we stay up for a while
               and listen to the storm.


                             LINDA

               Deal. Lemme check on Cheryl. I'll be
               right back.


     From across the room, she is seen opening CHERYL's door
     a crack. LINDA asks if she is all right, and gets a
     muffled reply. In the foreground, ASHLY removes the
     small box he showed to CHERYL earlier and places it in
     his hand. He glances behind to LINDA. She closes CHERYL's
     door and walks back to find ASHLY sound asleep with the
     box in his hand. She reaches for the box and ASHLY opens
     his eyes to watch. LINDA looks at him, but his eyes are
     closed again in time to still appear fast asleep. LINDA
     turns her attention back to the box. ASHLY watches again
     wide-eyed as she removes it from his hand. Quickly,
     LINDA turns to him but as expected, ASHLY is sleeping
     like a baby. She begins to turn back toward the box
     and ASHLY opens his eyes, but LINDA turns back again
     in time to catch him with his eyes wide open.


                             LINDA

               Ah ha!


                             ASHLY

               (Laughing) Stealing from the blind
               eh? It's for you.


     LINDA begins to open the box.


                             LINDA

               It better be good.


     The gold necklace is revealed inside.


                             LINDA

               Oh Ash, it's beautiful.


     LINDA kisses ASHLY. He removes the necklace from the box
     and holds it around her neck.


                             ASHLY

               (Fastening it around her neck) I was
               going to give it to you before we
               left, but things got so hectic, this
               is the first chance I've had. Do you
               like it?


     LINDA moves to a mirror.


                             LINDA

               It's beautiful. I really love it.
               (She turns to ASHLY) I'll never take
               it off.

     Lightning strikes as something in the woods examines the
     small cottage. Through the outside window, ASHLY and
     LINDA can be seen embracing. This force watching them
     moves around the house to another window. The silhouette
     of SCOTT and SHELLY undressing can be seen. The force
     continues around and arrives at CHERYL's window. Inside,
     she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a
     moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window.
     She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks
     at it, then out to the dark woods.



44   IN - C.B.


     CHERYL can faintly hear some kind of sound. It is the
     same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar. A
     noise almost like that of something breathing.



45   EN - CAB


     The evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as CHERYL
     walks through the rooms to the front door. She can be
     seen stepping out the door. It closes behind her. Wind
     shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering
     about.


                             CHERYL

               (Calling to the woods) Is anybody
               out there?


     There is no answer. CHERYL steps away from the cottage
     toward the woods.



46   EN - W


     The breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive.
     CHERYL stops.


                             CHERYL

               I know someone's out there...I
               heard you...I heard you in the cellar.


     Suddenly, CHERYL becomes chilled. She folds her arms
     around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening.
     There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind
     blowing through the trees. CHERYL steps into the forest
     a few feet then stops. A cry deep within the woods can
     be heard. She freezes. Whispering in the distance grows
     somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of
     something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth
     again. CHERYL is about to turn back toward the cabin
     when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty
     yards behind her. She stops. No sound. Nothing moves.
     Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. She
     turns but there is silence again. The winds die down,
     leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. Then,
     all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry
     of chaotic noises and movement. Snake-like vines wrap
     around her ankles and slither up her legs. Tree branches
     near by begin to claw and rake at her. The force is now
     moving through the woods toward her. CHERYL is able to
     break the vines and run toward the cabin. She emerges
     from the woods and into the clearing. The force is
     still following.



47   EN - CAB


     CHERYL reaches the cabin door but it is locked. She
     begins pounding upon the door.


                             CHERYL

               Help, help, let me in. Open the door!


     The evil entity now emerges from the woods.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly! Linda! Open up!


     CHERYL spots the small key ring above the door where
     SHELLY had returned them earlier. One by one, she fran-
     tically jams one key after another into the lock, but
     still cannot find the right one. The force comes closer
     with each key.


                             CHERYL

               Please, someone please! Help me, help
               meeeee!


     The evil entity is almost upon her, but her actions are
     so frantic that the ring falls to the ground. She bends
     down to pick them up, but a hand grabs her arm. It is
     SCOTT who has opened the door from the inside. She
     pushes him in the door and slams it tightly.



48   IN - M.R.


                             SCOTT

               What the hell happ-


                             CHERYL

               (In hysterics) It...it tried to kill
               me. I, I heard a noise and...and I
               ran and the trees...the trees!


                             SCOTT

               What are you-


     He is cut off by ASHLY approaching with the others.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl what's wrong with you? Did
               something in the woods do this to
               you?


                             CHERYL

               No, no, no...the woods themselves-
               The trees- they're alive...


     She hugs ASHLY tightly and cries in hysterical sobs.


                             CHERYL

               They're alive...


                             LINDA

               Ash, why don't I take her into the
               bedroom so she can lie down a little-


                             CHERYL

               (Cutting her off) -I'm not lying
               down! I'm not staying here. We're
               leaving this place, we're leaving
               this place right now!


                             SCOTT

               Wait a minute, I'm sure as hell not
               going anywhere.


                             SHELLY

               Cheryl-


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl, there's nothing out there.
               Trees do not attack people.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly, will you drive me into town
               or not?


                             ASHLY

               (Looking at his watch) Right Now?
               (He realizes how desperate she is)
               Sure, sure I'll drive you into town.
               But if you'll just listen to what
               you're saying, you-


                             CHERYL

               I don't care how it sounds. I want
               to leave this minute. You can bring
               back my things when you go.


                             ASHLY

               Okay- if you don't want to stay, I
               can't make you.


     LINDA puts a coat around CHERYL as ASHLY helps her to
     the door.



49   EN - CAB


     ASHLY and CHERYL move to the car. ASHLY helps CHERYL in
     then then gets in the drivers side.



50   IN - CAR


                             CHERYL

               I'll stay some place in town tonight.


     ASHLY tries to start the car. There is no response.
     CHERYL becomes somewhat worried. ASHLY tries again.
     The car will not turn over. A look of dread comes
     across CHERYL's face.



51   EN - CAB


     SCOTT and the others join the two outside.



52   IN - CAR


                             CHERYL

               It's not gonna start.


     ASHLY again tries the engine.


                             CHERYL

               I know it's not gonna start. It's
               not gonna let us leave.


     ASHLY keys the engine and it turns over this time, start-
     ing up with a roar. ASHLY, worried by CHERYL's condition
     glances over to her. Confused and upset, CHERYL turns
     away from ASHLY and looks out her window. They drive off
     into the night through the wooded mountains toward town.
     ASHLY glances at CHERYL who is studying the forest in-
     tensely for any sign of movement. The concern for his
     sister is made obvious by the expression on his face.
     Their car approaches the narrow bridge area and slows
     down.


                             CHERYL

               Why are you slowing down?


     ASHLY brings the car to a halt.


                             CHERYL

               What is this?


     ASHLY's gaze is fixed directly ahead, and his mouth opens
     slowly. He flips on the high beams which stab through the
     evening mist.



53   EN - B


     The bridge over the chasm has been torn away. CHERYL is
     silent as ASHLY walks to the ravine's edge to examine
     any remains.



54   IN - CAR


                             CHERYL

               (Mumbling to herself) No, no, no, no,
               no...it's not going to let us leave,
               it's not going to let us go...it's
               not gonna let us gooooo!



55   EN - CAB


     An axe is raised into the air, then brought down smash-
     ing upon a log, splitting it in two. SCOTT is chopping
     wood outside the cabin. Behind him, through a window,
     CHERYL sits with a cup of tea in her hand watching him.
     SCOTT sets his axe down, gathers the wood and moves
     away. CHERYL shifts her gaze from SCOTT to the woods
     beyond. The camera moves in toward CHERYL then past
     her to SHELLY and LINDA who can be seen playing cards
     on the floor. ASHLY is seated near the fireplace with
     the tape recorder in front of him. He plugs an earphone
     in so only he can hear it. SCOTT enters the cabin and
     passes in front of ASHLY to drop his wood to one side
     of the fireplace. He throws a log in, and heads back
     outside.



56   IN - M.R.


     From inside, LINDA speaks.


                             LINDA

               Cheryl, wanna play some cards?


                             CHERYL

               (Turning with a smile) Uh-uh.


     CHERYL turns to face the window again.


                             LINDA

               Hey, tomorrow morning, we'll find
               some way around that cliff into town
               okay?


                             CHERYL

               Okay.


     Outside the window, SCOTT chops more wood for the nights
     fire. ASHLY turns on the tape recorder to listen with
     the ear plug.


                             VOICE

               March 12th. Suzanne came after me
               and almost murdered me. My own wife.
               At first I thought it was a mental
               or physical disorder because of what
               had happened to her eyes, but I was
               only fooling myself. I knew what it
               was.


     Outside the window, SCOTT continues to chop and gather
     wood. SHELLY, still engaged in cards with LINDA, holds
     up one in particular.


                             SHELLY

               Okay, guess this card.


                             LINDA

               How am I going to know what card
               that is?


                             SHELLY

               Guess, I'm going to see if you're
               psychic.


     The card is a two of clubs.


                             LINDA

               Okaaaay...is it a queen?


                             SHELLY

               Right!


                             LINDA

               Really?


                             SHELLY

               Yeah.


                             LINDA

               Hey Ash, I guessed the card right.


                             ASHLY

               (indifferently) Truly amazing Linda.


     He is listening intently to the log as it continues.


                             VOICE

               Three days have passed since that
               thing has been down there. I was hop-
               ing to weaken it without food or
               water. Nothing worked. Finally, in
               desperation I dragged her out to the
               shed and dismembered her so that what-
               ever it was could not get up again.


                             SHELLY

               Cheryl, did you see that?


     CHERYL remains with her back to them staring out the
     window.


                             SHELLY

               Try this one.


     She removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up.


                             LINDA

               Okay, lemme think, uh...


     She puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form-
     ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card.


                             LINDA

               ...Um, it's a seven.


                             SHELLY

               Oh my God, what suit?


                             LINDA

               Diamonds, no wait! I mean hearts!


                             SHELLY

               That's right- seven of hearts!


                             LINDA

               Hey Ash, did you see that? I guessed
               two cards in a row.


                             ASHLY

               (Still not paying attention) How do
               you do it Linda?


     He is concentrating on the tape.


                             VOICE

               This is when I saw the dark figures
               moving about in the woods. I should
               have never tampered with the "Book
               Of The Dead." I now know that what-
               ever it is I have resurrected through
               this book, is coming for me.


                             LINDA

               You know, I always thought I had
               some sort of extra sense. You know,
               like e.s.p or something.


                             SHELLY

               What's this one?


     She holds up the queen of spades.


                             LINDA

               Another seven!


                             SHELLY

               I don't believe it!


                             CHERYL

               (Still looking outside) Queen of
               spades.


     SHELLY looks at her card then back to CHERYL. She holds
     up another card.


                             CHERYL

               Four of hearts.


     The card is a four of hearts. SHELLY bites her lip in
     fear and reaches for another card. ASHLY and LINDA listen
     in silence.


                             CHERYL

               Eight of spades.


     SHELLY picks up the card. CHERYL is correct again.


                             CHERYL

               Two of spades- jack of diamonds-
               jack of clubs-


     Faster and faster she calls them off. Even before SHELLY
     can flip them to keep up. Suddenly, CHERYL turns toward
     the group. Her eyes are bone white. SHELLY's deck of
     cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor.
     CHERYL's body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about
     like a white-eyed marionette. She speaks in a voice un-
     like her own.


                             CHERYL

               Why have you disturbed our sleep,
               awakened us from our ancient slum-
               ber? You will die. Like the others
               before you. We will take you one by
               one. All of you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     She screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the
     floor.


                             ASHLY

               Oh my God, Shelly, get Scott in here!


     SHELLY does not respond.


                             ASHLY

               Hurry!


     She exits through the front door. LINDA moves to CHERYL
     and lifts her head gently. CHERYL appears unconcious but
     behind her, she reaches for a pen.


                             LINDA

               Did you see her eyes? I'm scared.
               What's wrong with her?


     ASHLY begins to speak when SCOTT and SHELLY enter.


                             SCOTT

               What happened to her?


     CHERYL's hand clutches the pen tightly.


                             LINDA

               Look at her eyes.


     SCOTT's hand reaches for CHERYL's eyes to inspect them,
     but they blink open. The pen in her hand races upward,
     then slashes down, ripping into LINDA's achilles tendon.
     LINDA screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied
     pen is raised again. ASHLY grabs CHERYL's arm stopping
     her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining
     arm at LINDA who is sent sprawling across the cabin
     floor. CHERYL then clutches ASHLY and, almost lifting
     him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book-
     case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight.
     SHELLY stands screaming as CHERYL now advances toward
     ASHLY's face with the bloody pen. He struggles to pull
     himself out but cannot. CHERYL is almost upon him when
     SCOTT grabs her from behind. Effortlessly, she tosses
     him off and moves toward ASHLY again. SCOTT climbs to
     his feet and grabs the axe. CHERYL raises the pen above
     ASHLY's face, and SCOTT gives her a sharp jab in the
     jaw with the wooden handle. CHERYL stumbles past LINDA
     and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. She
     begins to climb out but SCOTT slams the trap door shut
     upon her hand. It won't close. CHERYL starts to push
     the trap door open from below. SCOTT climbs on top
     and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the
     butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. Demented
     screams and moans are heard from below as CHERYL's hand
     is finally pulled back and SCOTT manages to secure the
     chain across the hatch.



57   IN - LB


     Later that evening, LINDA is seen in her bed, sleeping.
     ASHLY covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks
     to the door, closing it quietly behind him.



58   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY joins SCOTT and SHELLY who sit near the fire in
     the main room. From the cellar, strange moans, sobs and
     laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from CHERYL's
     breathing. Through the next sequence of dialogue, her
     breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet.


                             SCOTT

               She'll be okay Ash, she just took a
               bad bump.


                             ASHLY

               (Quietly) Yeah.


     SCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below
     as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond.


                             ASHLY

               We've still got a few hours before
               morning.


                             SHELLY

               I don't know if I can wait that
               long.


                             SCOTT

               You have to. We all have to. Then,
               once it's light out, we'll try to
               find a way to get around that chasm.


                             SHELLY

               (Covering her ears) Why does she keep
               making those horrible noises?


                             ASHLY

               I don't know.


                             SHELLY

               And what about her eyes?


     ASHLY and SCOTT are quiet.


                             SHELLY

               What about her eyes? (Desperately)
               For God's sake what happened to
               her eyes?!


     CHERYL patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a
     streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the
     trap door. Her head is slightly tilted as she watches
     and listens to what is said above. From her point of
     view we hear SCOTT speak to SHELLY.


                             SCOTT

               Everything's gonna be all right.


     CHERYL's lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow
     liquid drools out between her teeth. She grins.

     Outside, the forest is very dark. The unseen force moves
     from the wooded area, pushing over small trees and shrubs
     as it advances. The cottage comes into view and the evil
     entity glides up to it. The figure of a girl in the cabin
     window can be seen looking out. The force stops and moves
     behind a bush.



60   IN - M.R.


     Inside, SHELLY is studying the woods.


                             SHELLY

               Scotty, I...I think there's some-
               thing out there.


     SCOTT joins her at the window and looks out.



61   EN - CAB


     From within the woods, this force watches SCOTT peer out,
     but he can see nothing. Through the window he says some-
     thing to reassure SHELLY and moves away.



62   IN - M.R.


     Inside, SCOTT can be heard in mid sentence.


                             SCOTT

               ...Is to get some rest. Ash and I
               can stay up with Cheryl.


                             SHELLY

               Okay.


                             SCOTT

               Everything's gonna be okay. Come
               morning- you'll see.


     SHELLY heads to her bedroom. SCOTT walks back to the
     fireplace and sits. He slices twigs from a branch with
     the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire. ASHLY
     glances at the Book Of The Dead, then to the old clock.
     It stands silent.



63   EN - CAB


     Again, the evil entity watches from outside. It sees
     SHELLY leave one room and turn the lights on in another.
     She begins to undress near the window. The force now
     moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous
     speed to SHELLY who is looking out her bedroom window.
     She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream
     stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late.



64   IN - M.R.


     A noise is heard from SHELLY's bedroom. SCOTT drops the
     small stick he was whittling and looks up. He places
     the dagger on the floor and walks toward SHELLY's room.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly, are you okay?


     She does not answer. SCOTT approaches her door and turns
     to ASHLY.


                             SCOTT

               Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute.



65   IN - S.B.


     SCOTT enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing
     amidst the shadows.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly?


     He looks over to her window. It is open, and wind blows
     upon the curtains.



66   IN - S. BATH


     SCOTT steps into SHELLY's bathroom and sees that the
     shower curtain is drawn. Cautiously, he moves up to it.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly?


     He pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub. SCOTT
     turns back to the bedroom when SHELLY steps into the
     doorway, posessed. With a scream, she latches upon SCOTT.
     Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at SCOTT's
     face and clothes with her nails.



67   IN - S.B.


     Screaming, SCOTT stumbles through her bedroom with SHELLY
     still upon him biting at his throat.



68   IN - M.R.


     They stagger into the main room where SCOTT manages to
     knock SHELLY off himself and into the fireplace. She
     remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot
     coals. SCOTT rushes to her, grabs an arm and pulls her
     out. SHELLY's face and hair on one side of her head are
     seared and blackened. She blinks her eyes open, turns
     her charred head to SCOTT, and speaks in a rasp.


                             SHELLY

               Thank you. I don't know what I would
               have done if I had remained on the hot
               coals burning my pretty flesh. You
               have pretty skin- give it to us!


     Cackling, SHELLY clutches SCOTT's neck and begins throttl-
     ing the life out of him with a vice-like grip. He tries
     to break the hold but cannot. ASHLY also tries but with
     a backhand blow, SHELLY knocks him into a cabinet, smash-
     ing it to bits. A garbled cry for help escapes from
     SCOTT's frothing mouth. SHELLY reaches down, picks up
     the Sumarian dagger, and holding SCOTT by his throat
     with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other.
     ASHLY, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. SCOTT
     grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings
     his camping knife from its side sheath and slices
     deep into SHELLY's raised wrist, almost severing it.
     A murky black ooze pumps from the wound. She emits
     an ear splitting- howl and tightens her grip on SCOTT's
     throat. He drops the hunting knife. ASHLY watches
     terrified, unable to move as SHELLY raises her dangling
     hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and
     bites it off. The useless part falls to the floor
     with the dagger still firmly in its fist. SCOTT, now
     almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the
     dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming
     the blade into her spine.

     SHELLY screetches along with CHERYL in the cellar, the
     old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all
     at the same instant. SHELLY reaches around with her
     remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife
     protruding from her own back. A thick black ooze pours
     from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ASHLY
     stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move.
     Black ooze runs from SHELLY's mouth as her body writhes
     about spasmatically upon the floor. Gradually, the move-
     ments cease and she is dead. As SCOTT slowly stands to
     his feet, SHELLY's arm grabs his leg.


                             SCOTT

               Ahhhhhhh!


     Some force reanimates her, even though the body is
     dead.


                             ASHLY

               No...no...no...


                             SCOTT

               Hit her!


     SHELLY's body is hoisted up, jerking about to its feet,
     and laughing madly.


                             SCOTT

               Hit it!


     SCOTT screams this as he backs toward ASHLY who stands
     with the axe, paralyzed. Gurgling black ooze, SHELLY
     advances toward them with one remaining arm. SCOTT
     grabs the axe from ASHLY, pushes him away and slams
     it into her. Lightning flashes, thunder booms, and
     CHERYL screams from the cellar. SCOTT brings his axe
     down again and again in a frenzy. Then, after the
     final chop, there is silence.

     SHELLY's body remains on the floor for quite some time-
     until ASHLY can cope with the fact that she is dead and
     something must be done.


                             ASHLY

               Uh...Scott.


                             SCOTT

               Yeah.


                             ASHLY

               What is uh...what are we gonna do?


                             SCOTT

               Bury her.


                             ASHLY

               You...can't bury Shelly. She's a friend
               of ours isn't she?


                             SCOTT

               Ash, she's dead.


     ASHLY moves away from SCOTT.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly's dead. We're gonna bury
               her now.


     ASHLY bites his lip and looks about blankly.



69   EN - CAB


     Finally, the body is dragged outside and buried near
     the work shed. Harsh floodlights from the house make the
     task look very stark and barren.



70   IN - M.R.


     SCOTT and ASHLY return inside. ASHLY heads to LINDA's
     room to check in on her.



71   IN - L.B.


     He peers in to see LINDA sleeping peacefully.



72   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY quietly returns to the main room. SCOTT is load-
     ing new batteries into a flashlight.


                             SCOTT

               I saw an old hiking trail when we
               were driving up here. Now I don't
               know if it goes all the way around
               that gorge-


                             ASHLY

               -Or if it's even still in tact.


                             SCOTT

               Or if it's even still in tact. But
               uh, I guess I'll find out. Take good
               care of Linda.


                             ASHLY

               I will. Do you have everything?


                             SCOTT

               (Putting on a small back pack) Yeah-
               all set.


                             ASHLY

               Listen...Scotty...I'm sorry about
               falling apart like that when-


                             SCOTT

               Don't bother, really.


     He steps out the door.


                             SCOTT

               If I find a way out of here, I'll
               mark it and then come back. Then if
               I'm not back here in a few hours...
               if for some reason...well, if I don't
               come back, grab Linda, leg and all,
               and just get her the hell out of here.


     They shake hands.


                             ASHLY

               You're a good man.


                             SCOTT

               Good, I'm the best.



73   EN - CAB


     ASHLY smiles a good-bye to SCOTT and watches him move
     off into the night. He lingers for a moment by SHELLY's
     grave, then slowly disappears into the woods.



74   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY closes the door and turns back to the main room.
     He sees CHERYL's eyes through the crack in the cellar.
     She has been watching all of this through a space be-
     tween the trap door and floor. ASHLY walks past her to
     LINDA's room.



75   IN - L.B.


     He opens the door and a crack of light falls across her.
     LINDA wakes up.


                             LINDA

               Who's there? Ash?


                             ASHLY

               It's me Linda.


                             LINDA

               Ash, I had a bad dream about Linda.


                             ASHLY

               You did baby?


                             LINDA

               Yeah. She's all right isn't she?


                             ASHLY

               Yeah. Fine.


                             LINDA

               Is Shelly okay too Ash?


     ASHLY can no longer hide his fear and anxiety. He speaks
     in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver.


                             ASHLY

               Yeah, sure. She's sleeping that's
               all.


                             LINDA

               Ash, I love you. (She turns over)


                             ASHLY

               Get some rest.


     ASHLY closes the door behind him and the fear from a few
     hours ago engulfs him once more.



76   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY moves into the main room and stops dead in his
     tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks.


                             CHERYL

               You lied to her. You lied to Linda.
               Shelly's not sleeping. She's dead.
               Don't you know the difference? You
               killed her. You and Scott cut her up
               with the axe. She's dead ha-ha-ha-ha-
               ha-ha-


     ASHLY picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap
     door. CHERYL is silent from below for a moment, then
     the hatch opens an inch or so. (The length of the chain
     securing it) CHEYL's white eyes can be seen again.


                             CHERYL

               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     ASHLY takes the axe and steps outside.



77   EN - CAB


     He begins to chop wood, taking out his emotions upon
     the logs with each blow. SHELLY's blood can still be
     seen on the blade of the axe.



78   IN - M.R.


     From her dungeon, CHERYL watches ASHLY chop wood in the
     window. The shadow of his axe rising then striking is
     seen over her white eyes.



79   EN - CAB


     Exhausted, ASHLY puts down the axe. He looks off into
     the woods but there is no sign of SCOTT. He returns to
     the cabin.



80   IN - M.R.


     CHERYL begins her taunting again.


                             CHERYL

               Soon all of you will be like me and
               then who will lock you in the cellar?
               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     CHERYL begins to violently ram her fists against the trap
     door. ASHLY walks by her to LINDA's room.



81   IN - L.B.


     She is still asleep. Quietly, so as not to wake her, ASHLY
     pulls back her blanket exposing the bandaged leg. He re-
     moves the wrappings and looks at the wound. As he does
     this, it infects with a blackened coloration at an in-
     credible speed. ASHLY looks up to see if LINDA is still
     sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with
     white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face. She lets
     out a low growl.



82   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY jolts backwards out of her room to escape through
     the front door. He steps outside and stops to look back
     in. He can see the main room, but finds it difficult to
     see in LINDA's room, being lost in the shadows. Something
     ragged and bloody grabs him. It is SCOTT's mutilated
     body ripped and torn to shreds. He is still alive. ASHLY
     looks behind him through the door to LINDA's room. He
     can barely make out LINDA who sits on the bed watching
     him with glaring white eyes. ASHLY helps SCOTT to the
     couch so he can sit. SCOTT is in agony and can barely
     speak.


                             SCOTT

               Ash, I think I'm dying. Jesus, I
               can't feel my legs.


                             ASHLY

               Uh...uh Scotty you're gonna be okay.
               You're gonna be just fine- you'll see.


     He throws another log on the fire.


                             ASHLY

               You'll see.


     He looks off into LINDA's bedroom again, but she is gone.
     She is now sitting in the corner of the main room where
     ASHLY is, watching him. SCOTT begins to cough with hor-
     rible rasping sounds.

                             SCOTT

               It's, it's not gonna let us leave...
               Cheryl...Cheryl was right...we're
               all gonna die here...


                             ASHLY

               We're not gonna die!


                             SCOTT

               ...All gonna die. All of us.


     ASHLY grabs SCOTT and shakes him violently.


                             ASHLY

               We're not gonna die! We're not gonna
               die! We're getting out of here! Now
               listen to me- is there a way around
               the chasm.


     SCOTT passes out.


                             ASHLY

               Scotty. Scott!


     ASHLY slaps SCOTT. He stirs awake and mumbles.


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Ash. I don't want to die. So...
               so lonely to die like this. You're not
               gonna leave me are you? Are you Ash?


                             CHERYL

               (Imitating SCOTT) I don't want to
               die. So lonely to die like this. You're
               not gonna leave me are you? Are you
               Ash? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


                             ASHLY

               Scott, is there some way around the
               chasm?


                             SCOTT

               Ash, I'm scared- I...I can't feel
               my legs.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, listen to me please, for
               God's sake. Is there a way around
               the chasm?


                             SCOTT

               There is...one way, the trail...but
               the trees, they know...don't you see-
               they're alive!! They're ali-ahhhhhhh!


     His sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain.
     Blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over
     grabbing his stomach. LINDA begins to laugh. ASHLY looks
     to her, or rather what posesses her with hatred.


                             ASHLY

               Shut up!


     She continues to laugh. CHERYL in the cellar joins in
     the laughter. ASHLY walks to LINDA and slaps her but
     she continues. He grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on
     the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety
     and places the barrels against LINDA's head.


                             ASHLY

               God forgive me Linda.


     The laughter stops and her eyes return to normal. It
     is LINDA again. ASHLY puts down the rifle.


                             LINDA

               Ash, oh Ash, help Me! Please.


     She hugs him tightly.


                             LINDA

               Don't let them take me away again,
               please, please, please.


                             ASHLY

               (Crying and holding her tightly) I
               won't, I won't- I promise.


     CHERYL's voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly? Ashly, help me. Let me out
               of here. I'm all right now.


     ASHLY releases LINDA and moves cautiously to the cellar.
     LINDA remains behind nervously fumbling with her necklace.


                             CHERYL

               I'm all right now, Ashly. I'm all
               right. Come unlock this chain and
               let me out.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl?


     There is no reply from the cellar. ASHLY looks through
     the crack but sees only darkness. He reaches for the
     chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something
     wrong, he stops.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl?


     He puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight-
     est sound. CHERYL's arms rip through the floor boards
     and grab ASHLY's head. He breaks away and her hand
     reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it. Slowly
     it withdraws beneath the floor.


                             CHERYL

               (A little too sweet) Ash, what are you
               doing? This is your sister Cheryl. Don't
               you recognize me?


     Her voice drifts off, and the evil leughter resumes from
     the celler.


                             ASHLY

               (Crying and yelling to the cellar)
               You bastards! Why are you doing this?
               Why?


     There is silence for a moment. Laughter from behind him
     begins again. It is LINDA. Her eyes are white once more,
     and she laughs at ASHLY.


                             ASHLY

               Oh...Linda.


     With newly found courage, ASHLY angrily grabs LINDA by
     the legs and drags her outside.



83   EN - CAB


                             LINDA

               It's useless, useless, useless. In
               time we'll come for him, then you
               ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     ASHLY leaves her in the woods and runs back to the cabin,
     closing the door behind him.



84   IN - M.R.


     SCOTT is coughing again.


                             SCOTT

               Ash, Ash, please...I don't want to
               die- but...but I can't stand this
               pain. It hurts Ash. Gimme something.
               Gimme something to put me out.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, I can't. I- I know it's bad.
               But I can't be alone now, I can't.
               I'd lose my mind.


                             SCOTT

               Please Ash, please.


                             ASHLY

               You'll get better- you'll see.


     LINDA's laughter is faintly heard outside. ASHLY moves
     to the window and pulls back the curtain. LINDA is no
     longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear-
     ing, watching ASHLY with her glowing white eyes.


                             ASHLY

               Yeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be
               better and we'll both get out of
               here tomorrow.


                             SCOTT

               There is no tomorrow! You- you've
               got to kill her and cut- cut her
               up- your sister too.


                             ASHLY

               No, that was only with Shelly. You
               had to with Shelly. You- Linda loves
               me. You're delirious- I...I'll get
               you some water.


     ASHLY places a glass to Scott's lips.


                             ASHLY

               Now, now the sun will be up in an
               hour or so and we'll get out of here
               ...together. You, me, Linda, Shelly-
               n-no not Shelly, she- we'll all go
               home together. Wouldn't you like to
               be going home? You'd like that I'd
               bet, wouldn't ya?


     There is no answer from SCOTT. The water runs out of
     his mouth.


                             ASHLY

               ...Scott.


     SCOTT is dead. LINDA's laughter is heard again. ASHLY
     walks to the window and pulls back the curtain. There
     is nothing there. He turns and she is there! With the
     Sumarian dagger, LINDA rips into ASHLY's shirt, cutting
     his arm. He screams and watches in horror as she runs
     her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it.
     She turns her attention toward ASHLY again but he grabs
     her and they struggle. LINDA backs ASHLY up against
     SCOTT, knocking his body to the floor. CHERYL's gnarled
     arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and
     grabs at ASHLY's foot. He manages to turn LINDA's arm
     so the knife is behind her back. Forcefully, ASHLY
     pushes her over the body of SCOTT and she falls back-
     ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it. The
     blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach.
     Lightning flashes, thunder roars, and LINDA screams in
     a deep growl once, then all is quiet.

     ASHLY drags LINDA's corpse past the crumpled body of
     SCOTT, past CHERYL, who watches all of this from below,
     through the back door and out to the work shed.



85   IN - W.S.


     He lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body
     to it with a number of chains which hang from nails
     along the wall. He rips down a tarp hanging on the
     wall to reveal a chain saw. He starts it up and moves
     toward her. Buzzing madly, the saw is lowered to a
     position several inches above LINDA's neck. ASHLY looks
     into LINDA's face. Her eyes have gone back to blue. He
     turns off the saw.


                             ASHLY

               (In a whisper) Linda...


     He drops the saw and breaks down crying over LINDA's
     body.



86   EN - CAB


     An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the
     shed as ASHLY carries LINDA's body outside for burial.
     He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel.
     Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create
     strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's
     grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of
     her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel
     and looks at her. She appears to be dead.



87   IN - M.R.


     Inside the cabin, CHERYL begins slamming her fists
     against the trap door in the cellar again. She wants
     out. The screws holding the hatch in place begin to
     loosen.



88   EN - CAB


     ASHLY places LINDA's corpse in the grave, oblivious to
     CHERYL's pounding. He begins to cover her with dirt.



89   IN - M.R.


     CHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the
     trap door in tact.



90   EN - CAB


     ASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDA's necklace on
     top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up
     when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and
     grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream-
     ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied
     hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she
     will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out
     of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's
     leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large
     log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again
     and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs
     the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him
     up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY
     hits the ground with considerable force and for the
     first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing
     he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's
     nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on
     the ground.


                             ASHLY

               Stay back.


     His hand gropes for the handle of the spade. LINDA
     advances toward him, laughing.


                             ASHLY

               Linda please, if you can still hear
               me. Keep away.


     His fingers tighten on the wooden handle. With a scream,
     she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the
     spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into
     the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk-
     ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from
     her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from
     underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls.
     He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace
     upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and
     staggers back to the cabin.



91   IN - M.R.


     Inside, he looks to the main room beyond SCOTT's body.


                             ASHLY

               Oh.....


     It is a moan from deep inside him. The trap door is open
     and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut.
     A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing
     SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the
     rifle again and cautiously moves to the door.



92   IN - S.B.


     He enters. The room is dark and the closet door bangs
     back and forth because of the breeze. ASHLY moves toward
     it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. Only
     clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of
     the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him.
     He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL
     backs away and spots the open front door.


                             ASHLY

               The door...


     He makes a mad dash through SHELLY's room.



93   IN - M.R.


     In the main room, ASHLY races for the door.



94   EN - CAB


     Outside, CHERYL is almost upon the door.



95   IN - MR


     ASHLY arrives in time, but CHERYL has already started
     reaching in. He slams the door on her fingers and rams
     his gun butt down upon them. Horrible screams are heard
     as CHERYL withdraws her hand. ASHLY is able to slam
     the door and bolt it. He runs to the back entrance lead-
     ing to the shed and locks it also. On his way back to
     the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. It is
     his last shell.


                             ASHLY

               (To himself) More shells. Where did
               I see that box of shells?



96   IN - C


     From the basement, the trap door lifts open and ASHLY
     decends. The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his
     weight, and ASHLY sprawls to the floor. Slowly, he picks
     himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway
     beneath the water pipes to a small table. On it, he finds
     the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun.
     He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more.



97   IN - M.R.


     The sound of ticking catches ASHLY's attention. He looks
     up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back-
     wards. He watches and waits tensely. Turning carefully,
     ASHLY tries to monitor all the windows. The ticking grows
     louder. A shadow passes in the window before him and he
     fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. Wind
     whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the
     floor. ASHLY waits, leaning against the front door for
     something to happen. He is tense and more determined
     than ever to survive. He whispers to himself.


                             ASHLY

               C'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why
               are you torturing me like this?

     Placing his hand to his side, ASHLY discovers something
     in his pocket. He lifts it to his eyes. It is LINDA's
     necklace.


                             ASHLY

               ...Linda. (He whispers)


     The ticking stops. He tilts his head for the slightest
     sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through
     the door and grab him. ASHLY tears away and falls to
     the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion.
     CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole
     in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and
     fires at her head.



98   EN - CAB


     Clutching at her face and screaming horribly, CHERYL
     is jolted from the door.



99   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY places a dresser and chair against the holes in
     the door. Behind ASHLY, SCOTT's corpse sits up and opens
     its white eyes. It stands and moves toward ASHLY. He
     turns with the gun, but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands.
     Desperately, ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it
     across SCOTT's head, then jams the exposed socket into
     his face, shocking him. SCOTT staggers back several
     steps, then continues after ASHLY.



100  EN - CAB


     Outside, Cheryl is now pounding against the front door.



101  IN - M.R.


     ASHLY picks up a small table upon which are the Book Of
     The Dead, and the professors journal. He throws it at
     SCOTT. This does not affect him, and he advances closer.
     The Book Of The Dead lands near the fireplace and edges
     of the paper darken from the heat. SCOTT picks up ASHLY
     and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll. The
     front door begins to give under CHERYL's pounding. ASHLY
     brings his hands to SCOTT's eyes. With a crash, CHERYL
     breaks through the front door and begins to push the
     dresser away. Pages from the Book Of The Dead are smolder-
     ing now. ASHLY jams his fingers into SCOTT's eyes and
     slips from the grip. SCOTT clutches his eye sockets and
     his back begins to smolder. ASHLY now sees the book. Its
     pages burn at the edge. CHERYL topples the dresser and
     enters the room. Her face is partially torn away from
     the shot gun blast. ASHLY rushes to throw the book onto
     the burning logs, but CHERYL, smoldering also, gives
     him a backhand blow across the head, and he is sent
     sprawling to the floor. She grabs a fireplace poker with
     her crushed fingers and turns back to ASHLY who is crawl-
     ing toward the fireplace. When almost in reach of the
     book, SCOTT grabs his leg and begins to pull ASHLY back-
     ward. CHERYL approaches with smoke pouring from her
     clothes and slams ASHLY across the back with her poker.
     ASHLY screams. A glitter catches his eye. It is LINDA's
     necklace. Grabbing it, he tosses the end with a clasp
     toward the book. It slides off the cover. SCOTT pulls
     him back once more as ASHLY swings the necklace in a
     last desperate attempt. CHERYL raises the poker for the
     final blow. The necklace drapes over the book and as
     ASHLY is dragged, the clasp hooks the cover and pulls
     the book with him. With a yank, he seizes the book and
     tosses it upon the blaze.

     CHERYL and SCOTT freeze. The Book Of The Dead burns in
     a bluish green flame. Smoke pours from SCOTT and CHERYL
     as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods.
     The fireplace poker slips from CHERYL's hand and sticks
     into the wood scarcely an inch from ASHLY's head. The
     bodies of SCOTT and CHERYL then begin to cave inward
     upon themselves, collapsing to the floor in smoldering
     heaps. Finally, nothing is left but the burnt clothing
     and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies
     once were.

     The old clock begins to tick again, normally. ASHLY slowly
     climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris. Open-
     ing his hand, he looks down at LINDA's necklace. The force
     retreats from him, out the door, slowly returning to the
     darkness from which it emerged. Gradually, the natural
     sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as
     Autumn colors return. The first rays of sunlight gleam
     over the woods beyond the cabin. Daybreak has finally
     come.

A sound is building.  Like a living wind.  A
      thousand screams in agony.

      From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together
      quickly, forming the Main Title against black:

                         "EVIL DEAD"

      Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

      reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.

      Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE
      MUSIC.  In the distance, through the smoke, a
      small object. It fans toward us quickly, filling the
      frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
      the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is
      the Book of the Dead.

                              NARRATOR
               Legend has it, that it was written by
               the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX MORTES;
               Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead.

      The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its
      skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES
      on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth
      opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races
      into the blackness of the screaming mouth.

      The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart.

      TRACKING SHOT

      The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
      Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
      Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
      knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
      weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
      with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
      a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
      unusual jagged edged weapon.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               And then...

      The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
      and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
      the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
      tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
      sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
      doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
      illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
      fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
      been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
      Book, awestruck.

      Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
      the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
      the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
      Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
      her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
      old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
      handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
      moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.
      The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

      and forward into the light.  As she rocks forward into
      the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
      eyes have changed to a milky white.  She continues to

      The sound of heavy footsteps.  Dust drifts down INTO

      It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin.
      He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the
      floor above him.  And then, the footsteps halt.

					RAYMOND
               And now, I fear that my wife has become
               host to a Kandarian demon.  May God forgive

      Ash enters the cabin.  He sees The Book of the Dead
      and tosses it onto the flames.

      FINAL SHOT OF EVIL DEAD I

      We are racing forward.  We have taken the POV of
      an EVIL ENTITY as it glides with dark purpose through
      a section of woods. It approaches the rear door of the
      cabin.  The door is torn violently open.  The next door
      falls away from us.  We approach the front door. SLAM! It
      jigsaws in two and we are again outside, now in front of
      the cabin.  Ash is seen in the distance.  He is staggering
      away, his back to us as we race at him.  He turns suddenly
      towards CAMERA and screams.

      The final shot of Evil Dead I has a new ending; an
      extension. Ash is caught by an invisible grip.
      "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he is rocketed
      backwards.  He is swept hand over foot through the
      air.  He reaches the edge of the woods and begins
      tearing through the branches and smaller trees,
      clearing a path with his body.  He finally slams into
      a large ungiving tree trunk and he is knocked
      unconscious.

      He lifts his face from the mud, and turns toward us.
      His eyes have gone white. His skin is now a pale color,
      his lips, jet black.  He is Possessed.  A bright edge of
      morning sunlight moves across his face.  He turns his
      beastly face skyward.

      Ash, no longer possessed, collapses into the mud puddle,
      unconscious.


41B   EXT. WOODS - DAY - REVERSE ACTION - FOG - 3 ANGLES    41B

      Streams of morning sunlight pierce the darkness of the
      woods.  We hear the shriek of demons.  The sound of
      SIZZLING.  A great wind blows back fog into the darker
      sections of the woods.  The scene grows brighter and
      the peaceful sounds of morning are faded up.

      His eyes open.  They stare blankly up at the sky.  Then
      fear registers and we CRANE BACK QUICKLY, revealing a
      vast area of empty woods around Ash.


44    MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     44

      A hideous human skull with living eyeballs that stare
      out at us with evil malice.  The eyes stare out from
      the two dark windows.  The dark nose area is the open
      doorway, and the rotted teeth of the skull are the
      whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin.
      Then it fades, leaving only the cabin.

      Ash MOVES INTO A CLOSE UP.  His eyes shift back and forth
      like a trapped animal as he looks about for a means of
      escape.  He spots something.

      A narrow dirt road cutting through the woods. Then,
      the Delta 88 roars down it, and past the CAMERA.  It
      kicks up dust and gravel.

      Ash is driving.  He wipes the mud and blood from his
      face with a rag.  As he pulls the rag away, his face
      forms a sudden look of horror as he sees:

      A GIANT STEEL HAND LOOMS towards us. It is the twisted
      remains of the steel and wood bridge that crossed
      a great mountain chasm.  A LOUD SCREECH of brakes
      is heard on the soundtrack on this cut.

      He looks at the bridge.

      ASH'S POV - BRIDGE

      A sign hangs from the twisted girders.  It reads:
      "DANGEROUS BRIDGE - 2 TON WEIGHT LIMIT - CROSS AT OWN
      RISK."  Beyond this we see the twisted remnants of the
      former bridge and the rock cliffs far away on the other
      side.

      bridge, to the road behind him.  He moves in halting
      steps, not knowing which way to turn.

      Ash opens his mouth, draws in his breath, and just as
      he begins to scream, we CUT TO:

      As it rises up from what appears to be the mountain
      chasm and reveals the opposite side of the twisted
      girders which form the "Giant Hand."  It spots Ash
      immediately beyond.  It moves swiftly towaad him.
      Ash looks up, sensing the evil and darts into the
      Delta 88.  The FORCE moves through the twisted girders,
      pushing them away violently and races towaad the car.

      The Delta starts up and peels off.  The Evil Force
      just misses it.  The car doesn't have the room to
      complete the one hundred and eighty degree turn
      necessary to head back down the road the way it
      originally came, and is forced into a line of break-
      away trees which explode into sawdust as the front of
      the Delta 88 rips through them.  The car swerves
      onto the road, headed back toward the cabin.

      in place in the rear of a camera car that is slowly
      backing away from the cabin.)  The more he runs, the
      farther away from the cabin he gets.

      in on Ash as he races down the hallway.  We lose him
      as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin and
      slams the door behind him.  We rip through this door
      and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling
      for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach
      and he swings shut in our face.  We rip through to
      reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.  We follow him
      through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the
      Hallway.  We round the corner after him and see that
      Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a
      trace of him.  We look about for him, but he is gone.
      The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves.

      A writing desk with some papers atop it.  They begin
      to tremble and finally blow away from the light breeze
      that sweeps through the cabin.  The CAMERA PANS down
      from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor of
      the main room.  The trap door to the cellar.  It is
      raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that
      slight space between the trap door and the floor we
      see Ash's eyes, looking cautiously about.  He breathes
      a sigh of relief.

      Ed Getly stands in the FG and watches as an older
      style twin engine cargo plane flies over the camera
      and lands.


149L  AIRSTRIP - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT - PASSENGERS         149L

      The airplane rolls to a halt.  A man wearing a
      jumpsuit ties the airplane off and blocks the wheels
      while a redcap opens the hatch and helps out Annie
      Knowby.  She carries a glass case in her hand as she
      moves toward us.  Behind her five other passengers
      emerge from the Plane.  Ed approaches Annie.

                              ED
               Annie!

                              ANNIE
                         (smiling at sight of him)
               Hi.

      They embrace and kiss.

                              ED
               How'd everything go on the expedition?

                              ANNIE
               Terrific.  I found the additional pages
               from the Book of the Dead.

                              ED
               So you said in the telegram.  What
               condition are they in?

      She holds out the glass case for Ed to look at.

               Haven't aged a day in three thousand years.

                              ANNIE
               Maybe longer.

                              ED
               When do we begin the translations?

                              ANNIE
               Tonight.  Is everything all set with my
               father?

                              ED
               Should be, but I haven't spoken to him
               in a week, what with no phone in that
               cabin.  Take us about an hour to get there.

      They arrive at the parking lot.  Two new, sharp looking
      cheverolets and Ed's old style cheverolet.

                              ED
               We'll take my car.

      Ed opens the car trunk.  Behind him a redcap pulls up
      a large steamer trunk on a hand dolly.  Ed and the redcap
      hoist the steamer up into the car's trunk.

                              ED
               Annie, you hinted in your telegram that
               your father was on to something with the
               first part of his translations.  What's
               the big mystery?  What has he found in
               The Book of the Dead?

                              ANNIE
               Maybe nothing.  But just possibly...
               the doorway to another world?

      Annie slams the car trunk.

      CHEVROLET CAR TRUNK

      CAMERA has taken the POV of the evil force as it glides
      eerily through the woods, around trees and over rotted
      stumps.  It moves over a rise revealing a clear view
      of the boarded cabin in the distance.  It approaches.
      It moves to the window, and peering through the cracks
      in the boards we see Ash asleep in the rocking chair.


152   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          152

      Camera begins on hammer, nails, and planking which
      lay upon the cabin floor.  Camera pans to window #1.
      It is boarded up tight.  Camera pans to door.  It
      is repaired.  Camera pans to Ash who sleeps in the
      rocking chair in front of another boarded window.

      Ash awakens suddenly, sensing something, the
      shotgun clutched in his lap.  He lifts his head and
      turns to a whispering musical sound.  Harp like music.
      It is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin.

      bedroom.


154   ASH'S POV - MIDDLE ROOM AND REAR BEDROOM              154

      As he approaches the rear bedroom, the music grows louder.
      As he enters the room he halts his gaze on the old wooden
      piano.

      MEDIUM SHOT - ASH

      As he moves to the piano.  The sound is coming from
      within.  Suddenly, the piano begins to play by itself;
      Ash draws back from it.  It plays a waltz.  Now the
      piano music mixing with the harp-like strings.  The
      radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of
      musical steam, adding a wind section to this strange
      orchestra.


156   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      156

      As he listens to this haunting version of a waltz melody.
      He recognizes the music.  It is the same music that Ash
      had played earlier, when Linda was dancing.


157   CLOSE SHOT - PIANO AND RADIATOR                       157

      As steam spouts from the radiator pipes.  As the piano
      keys depress and release themselves.  The melody grows
      louder.


158   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      158

      As he lowers his head.  His horror gives way to sadness.
      From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket
      that dangles from the end of a chain.  In the locket's
      center is a magnifying glass.  He stares mournfully into
      the glass.  BANG!  He looks up sharply toward the main
      room.

      Wind sweeps in through the place as the curtains flutter
      wildly.  Through the window is a sweeping fog.

      Ash runs through this room and into the main room.  He

      face from outside.

      The tiny figure of Ash can be seen looking off toward
      this hill.  In the foreground is a crude burial cross
      and a mound of earth.  The earth begins to crack and
      splinter.  The wooden cross caves in and is swallowed
      as the headless corpse of Linda pulls itself to its
      feet.  The HAUNTING WALTZ MELODY sweeps through the
      night air.

      (MINIATURE/STOP MOTION/REAR SCREEN) - 3 ANGLES

      The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting
      corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and
      swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening
      fog.  A waltz of the dead.

      The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more
      primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat.
      The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with
      sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

      As it leaps through the air and gracefully situates
      itself atop Linda's neck, she begins to spin, yet her
      head remains in place, never taking her eyes from Ash.
      With a sensual twirl and leap, she disappears into the
      evening mists.

      abruptly halts.

      getting control of himself.  He looks to the window that
      had blown open.

               Hello lover, I came from the other

      clamped to his hand.


187   INT. WORK SHED - NIGHT - LINDA DUMMY HEAD - ASH       187

      The door to the place is kicked open, revealing Ash
      and Linda's head on the end of his hand.  It is a room
      full of sawdust, chains and power tools.  Old bones
      hang from the walls.

      outline of where a chainsaw once was.


187C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HEADLESS LINDA BODY                187C

      Confused.  Wondering what has happened to the

      open and in comes the flailing, headless, body of
      Linda, charging at Ash with the chainsaw buzzing high
      above her head.  Ash is screaming.

      shower of sparks, sending the buzzing saw flipping
      backward.


187F  MEDIUM SHOT - HEADLESS LINDA DUMMY - 3 ANGLES         187F

      The blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs
      back into headless Linda, imbedding itself in her
      neck.  She goes nuts as the chainsaw bites its way
      into her chest cavity.  She spins wildly about the
      room knocking into shelves as she tries to pull the
      blade free.  She slams against the wall of the shed,
      and slumps to the floor, the chainsaw still buzzing.

      She is no longer possessed.  She looks as she did
      earlier in the film.  A vision of beAuty.  She is
      again Linda, the woman Ash loved.  Tears roll down from
      her eyes.

                              LINDA
               Please Ash, help me.  I love
               you, please don't hurt me.

               NO!


187O  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             187O

      Once again fully possessed, and speaking in the voice
      of the demon.  Her eyes again white, her flesh, rotten.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               YES!  YOU LIED TO HER! YOU LIED TO
               LINDA! YOUR LOVE WAS A LIE!  AND
               NOW SHE BURNS IN HELL!

187Q  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187Q

      As he's drenched in the face.  Linda begins to laugh at
      him in a wild, high pitched squeal.

      He gains control of himself and steadies the saw.

                              ASH
               Eat chainsaw.

      He brings down the spinning blade.  And moves past
      the CAMERA and towards the head.  We are left looking
      at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the
      stark shadow of the ghastly deed.  We hear the sound
      of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a
      demon.


187R  CLOSE SHOT - LIGHT BULB                               187R

187S  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187S

      Ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the
      wall, now lit in crimson.  He looks at the off screen
      carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in
      shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his
      hands; they are covered in Linda's blood.

      He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying
      to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting
      himself with the stuff.  Ash screams a wild scream of
      fear and despair.  It echoes off into the night.


188   CRANE SHOT - EXT. WORK SHED - NIGHT                   188

      Ash in a confused state as he staggers from the
      work shed and towards the cabin.  Again clutching
      the chainsaw.


189   INT. CABIN REAR DOORWAY - NIGHT                       189

      Ash enters through the doorway.  He pushes the door
      shut behind him and halts.  We hear a creaking sound.
      It is coming from the main room of the cabin.  He
      moves in the direction of the sound.


189A  ASH'S POV - REAR HALLWAY - NIGHT                      189A
      TRACKING SLOWLY FORWARD

      Curtains flutter on the partially boarded windows of
      the hall.  Ash moves slowly past them and towards the
      main room ahead.  The gentle creaking sound grows
      louder.  Ash tosses down the saw and picks up the gun.


189B  INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          189B

      Ash enters from the hallway and turns his head to the
      sound.


189C  MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - ASH'S POV - THE ROCKING CHAIR     189C

      It rocks back and forth with a definitive motion,
      halting for a moment at it's pints furthest forward
      and backward, as if some invisible thing was sitting
      there and rocking.


189D  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      189D

      He slowly approaches the chair, scared shitless.


189E  MEDIUM SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE ROCKING CHAIR           189E

      The chair rocks in and out of frame in the foreground
      as Ash takes halting steps towards it.  Ash gathers
      his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the
      rocking motion.  Slowly his hand approaches the chair.
      Just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly
      halts, on its own accord.


190   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     190

      In a confused state as he backs away from the chair and
      into the wall.  He turns and comes face to face with
      himself in a hanging framed mirror.  He clutches at his
      face, trying to reassure himself of his sanity.

                              ASH
               I'm fine... I'm fine...


191   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM/MIRROR ROOM - NIGHT              191
      MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - ASH AND REFLECTION

      Ash's reflection becomes an independent entity.  It
      reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of Ash by his
      throat.  The reflection looks like a Mr. Hyde version of
      Ash.  Sweating and nasty looking.


192   SIDE SHOT - SPLIT SCREEN - ASH AND REFLECTION         192
      MITCHELL CAMERA (ASH AS MR. HYDE)

      The reflection pulls Ash close and speaks to him in an
      intimate whisper.

                              REFLECTION
               I don't think we're "fine".  We're
               losing it...  starting to slip.  We
               just cut up our girlfriend with a
               chainsaw.  Does that sound fine?

      The reflection tightens its hold on Ash's throat and
      begins to strangle him.

      Two hands in the bottom of frame, throttling him.
      CAMERA races back to reveal Ash's own hands on his throat.
      There is no sign of Ash's evil reflection.  Ash has
      been strangling himself.  He realizes this the same
      moment we do.  He quickly pulls his hands away, looks at
      them incredulously, then to the mirror.


194   OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - INTO MIRROR                     194

      His reflection is as it should be.

      INTERVOLOMETER

      The bite marks that Linda's teeth have left in the hand
      stand out sharply.  The wound suddenly blackens and
      spiderwebs it's infection across the entire surface of the
      hand.

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HAND IN FOREBROUND - MAKE UP BLADDER EFX

      The hand quivers and shakes, now out of Ash's control.
      The hand has taken a whitish cast.  It's veins throb and
      pulsate.  It is possessed by the evil force.  The hand's
      fingernails grow inches.  The wound oozes black fluid.
      Ash is repulsed.


198   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      198

      Ash's demon hand makes a lunge at his face which is
      countered by his good hand.


199   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     199

      He slams the hand to the cabin floor.  He screams to
      the air:

                              ASH
               You bastards.  Give me back my hand.

      Wind and fog swirl about the place.  Ash's ECHOING
      SCREAM is heard above the HOWLING GALE.

      Ash rushes into the kitchen and places his hand in
      the sink.  He turns on the faucet.


205   INT. CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT                            205

      Cool water runs over Ash's burned hand.  Ash rests his
      head on the kitchen counter and mumbles reassurances to
      himself.

                              ASH
               Can't... can't be happening.


206   CLOSE SHOT - THE HAND                                 206

      As the water pours over it.  It grabs a plate sitting
      in the dishwater and reaches up silently out of the sink.


207   MEDIUM SHOT                                           207

      The plate is shattered over Ash's head.  The
      hand grabs Ash's hair and mercilessly slams his
      head down upon the kitchen counter again and again.
      Ash punches himself in the face and is sent reeling
      backwards.  He smashes into a cupboard where dishes
      and plates fall upon him.


208   CLOSE SHOT                                            208

      Ash is knocked unconscious.  The hand continues breaking
      objects over his head.  Ash lies unmoving, but still
      alive.


210   CLOSE SHOT                                            210

      The hand stops as though it senses something.  The
      CAMERA PANS to a large meat cleaver which lies upon the
      wooden floor.


211   MEDIUM SHOT                                           211

      The hand as it independently crawls towards the meat
      cleaver.  The hand is stopped when it runs out of arm,
      now anchored by Ash's unconscious body.


212   CLOSE-SHOT - HAND                                     212

      It digs its nails deep into the floorboards and begins to

214   CLOSE SHOT - HAND - GELETIN HAND                      214

      As it pulls Ash's unconscious body along after it. The
      hand clutches the meat cleaver when a large knife comes
      slicing through the demon hand, pinning it to the
      floorboards.  CAMERA pulls over to reveal a revived Ash.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now?


214A  ANGLE - ASH - COMEDY KNIFE RIG                        214A

      He reaches over with his good hand and pulls a fire
      engine red chainsaw down from the shelf.

      He holds the body of the machine between his legs and,
      with his good hand, pulls the starter cord.  The
      CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  The CAMERA TRACKS IN to Ash's
      sweating face.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now!?

      He lowers the spinning blade of the chainsaw down out
      of frame and toward the evil hand.  Blood flies up
      into frame.

      A red tow truck with its orange lights flashing is
      parked there. Painted on it's side is "Jake's Gas
      N' Go." Jake, a toothless, backwoods, greasemonkey is
      setting up flares and wooden roadblocks.  Annie and Ed
      approach.

                              ANNIE

      Bobby Joe takes a pinch of chewing tobacco and stuffs

      fancy clothes.  She stares at Annie like a cat.

      carry the glass case containing the missing pages
      and the handbag.  A grunting and sweating Jake brings
      up the rear, the large steamer trunk on his back.
      He is cursing under his breath.

      As he grabs the steel wastebasket, dumps out the trash
      lowers it quickly over the CAMERA, trapping the hand
      within.


230   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     230

      With a note of finality, Ash slams down a pile of books
      atop the overturned wastecan, to anchor it.  The top
      book's title reads "Farewell to Arms".


231   FIREPLACE                                             231

      Ash raises a red hot fireplace shovel that had been
      resting upon the coals.  He grits his teeth.


232   ANGLE                                                 232

      Just out of frame, Ash thrusts the glowing shovel against
      the stump to cauterize the wound.  Red steam hisses up
      into frame as Ash screams.


233   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     233

      He tosses aside the shovel and douses his smoldering
      stump into a vase of fresh flowers.


234   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      234

      Unspooling a roll of duct tape.


235   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     235

      He tapes the tablecloth into a makeshift bandage
      about his wrist.  Behind him, the wastebasket
      silently slides across the floor.


236   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     236

      "CLANG"! He turns to see.


237   CLOSE SHOT - THE WASTEBASKET                          237

      Upon its side.  The Evil Hand is gone.

      He raises the shotgun and FIRES.  BLAM!  The floor
      next to the hand explodes.


249   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN THE WALL - SQUIB - EFX. HAND     249

      The hand leaps into the hole as a section of wall next
      to it EXPLODES.  Blam!


250   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      250

      Ash quickly reloads both chambers of the gun.
      He tracks the SOUND of the PITTER PATTER as the hand
      scampers through the sapace behind the wall like a rat.

      The blasted hole at the bottom of the wall.  The hand
      appears, still unhurt, waving and taunting at Ash.


255   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 255

      As it taunts ASH it inadvertently sidesteps into a
      rusting mousetrap.  SNAP!  It springs shut upon the
      hand.  It screams furiously and shakes violently in
      an effort to get free the from trap.


256   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      256

      Throws back his head in a gruff bark of laughter.

                              ASH
               Ha!


257   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 257

      The hand throws the trap from itself and raises its
      middle finger to ASH, flipping him the bird.


258   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               258

      He raises the gun, revealing his face as the
      CAMERA PANS UP with his movement.


259   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL                       259

      Pointed directly at the hand.  But the hand dodges
      away from the hole, disappearing again behind the
      wall.  The gun continues to track the evil hand's
      progress through its pitter patter sound.


260   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EAR                                260

      The pitter patter ebbs and then peaks in volume.


261   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL - SQUIB               261

      Both triggers are squeezed.  BLAM!  BLAM! A 2nd and
      3rd hole are blown in the wall.  All is silent.

262   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      262

      As he lowers the smoking gun.  Wondering if he has hit
      the hand or not.


263   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 263

      All is silent for a moment, and then a slight trickle
      of blood comes dripping from the hole and down the
      side of the wall.


264   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      264

      For the first time feeling victorious.  As Ash continues
      to stare at the hole, his expression changes to one of
      perplexity.


265   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 265

      The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow,
      then, even this volume of blood multiplies.  It is
      forced out of the wall with a greater and greater
      pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire
      hose.


266   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      266

      Horrified, he spins his glance to the sound of more
      gushing liquid.  He is hit in the face with a geyser
      of deep red blood.


267   CLOSE SHOT - 2ND AND 3RD HOLES IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS    267

      The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood
      in a geyser.  The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the
      holes.  This, too, is an eruption of blood.  The blood
      changes in color to a black fluid, then yellow, then
      turquoise.


268   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          268

      Screaming as he looks down at his wrist.  CAMERA PANS
      DOWN to it.  The severed wrist begins dribbling blood.
      Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose.
      It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is
      driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.


269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                           269

      We follow him as he slams from one wall into another.


270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          270

      In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it
      all suddenly stops.  The cabin is again deadly quiet.
      ASH, soaked in blood and shivering, waits.  For what,
      he's not sure.


271   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     271

      As he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon
      the three legged chair.  It shatters beneath him,
      dumping him on his butt.

      CREAK!!!

      ASH turns sharply to the low sound.


272   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                272

      The mounted moose head upon the wall.  It is in a
      different position.  It turns sharply towards ASH and
      emits a hideous cackle.


273   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      273

      He pulls back in fear, then turns to the sound of more
      laughter.


274   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                274

      The desk lamp on its steel swivel rises and falls in
      synchronization with its wheezing laughter.  Ah ha ha
      ha ha.  Ahhhh ha ha ha ha!


275   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      275

      Terrified, he turns to more laughter.


276   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                276

      A line of 12 old books upon the shelf flap open and
      closed violently as they emit a chorus of sharp laughs.
      Ash turns.


276A  CLOSE SHOT                                            276A

      Other books upon the floor laugh.


277   MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER                     277

      He turns sharply toward us and breaks into an
      uproariously frightening bout of laughter.


278   WIDE SHOT - ASH                                       278

      The wooden door behind Ash comes to life.  It
      stretches out as though it were elastic with each of
      its own low and terrible laughs.


279   WIDE SHOT - MAIN ROOM - TRACKING SHOT                 279
      RIGGING FOR TRAP DOOR, CABINETS, CLOCK

      Ash and everything in it are having the time of their
      lives.  Ash leads the bunch laughing harder and
      harder.


279A  MEDIUM SHOT - HAND HELD - FRONT DOOR AND ASH          279A

      KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!

      The room's laughter suddenly stops.  Ash instantly
      terrified, grabs up the shotgun and fires into the
      door.  Blam!  Blam!

      PAN to the front door.

      Two holes are blown into the door.  We hear a short
      shrill scream and then all is quiet.

      Ash opens the front door.  It slowly swings inward
      with a creak revealing the empty night.


283   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND JAKE                            283

      Ash approaches the front porch as Jake enters sharply

      Ash's fist comes up into frame catching Jake on the
      jaw.  Jake pulls back his fist and rockets a piledriver
      blow to Ash's face, knocking him senseless.

      She holds her shoulder where the shell has grazed her.

                              JAKE
               You gonna be alright, honey?

                              BOBBY JOE

                              JAKE
               You know this son of a bitch?

                              ED

      Annie steps forward.

                              ANNIE

                              ANNIE
               What the hell did you do to them?

      to the trap door that leads to the cellar.

               We'll throw him in there.

                              ANNIE
               These are my father's things.

      She turns on the tape recorder.  High pitched feedback
      and the professor's screams come from the speaker.

                              PROFESSOR KNOWBY
                         (Voice on Tape)

                         (Voice on tape)
               I cannot bring myself to dismember

      Ash's legs in the foreground.  Suddenly from the
      earthen floor of the fruit cellar a half-rotten human
      head juts up!  Just the eyes are above the surface of the
      dirt.  They dart about wildly and halt upon Ash.  Worms
      crawl from the rotted forehead.

      leg as he tries to back away.  The corpse that was
      Henrietta pulls itself from the grave and emits a wail.
      She turns her twisted body to face Ash.  Moths fly
      about her in a flurry.

                              HENRIETTA
               Someone's in my fruit cellar!
               Someone with a fresh soul!

      With a sharp recoil, then spring, Henrietta makes a
      lunge at Ash.  Her face contorting, her teeth
      lengthening, her mouth opening impossibly wide
      as though she were going to swallow his head, and all as
      she lunges forward.  She changes to "Pee Wee" head.

      As he moves to help Jake, Henrietta swats at his jaw,
      knocking him backward into a picture frame. He shatters it
      with his head and slumps to the floor.

      Ash leaps down upon the trapdoor, slamming it to pin

      eyeball popping from her head, like a cork from a
      champagne bottle.

      her back down into the cellar. The trap door shuts.
      Ash leaps atop it. The sound of Henrietta falling down
      the cellar steps is heard along with the beast's wild
      ravings.  Ash quickly threads the chains through the
      eyeloops.


343   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      343

      They freeze in their tracks as they hear a gentle voice
      which sings a melancholy tune.  Annie turns her head
      to the sound and the CAMERA PANS TO reveal HENRIETTA whose
      head juts in the space between the floorboards and the
      trap door.  She is no longer possessed.  She looks as
      she did earlier in the film.  She is singing a gentle
      song to Annie.

               in here.

                              ANNIE

      Annie starts to follow the instructions, but Ash halts

      it.  She shakes her head and looks to the cellar.

                              ANNIE
               No.  No.  I don't know what you

                              VOICE OF HENRIETTA
               You were born September 2nd, 1962.  I
               remember it well because it was
               snowing.  So strange that it would
               be snowing in September.


348   CAMERA TRACKING IN ON ANNIE                           348

               That thing in the cellar is not
               my mother!

      Ed stands sharply into her frame.  His eyes bone white,
      his skin, the pale color of the dead.  His mouth has
      grown over large.  His lips are black.  He is possessed.
      He shrieks.  Annie screams and jumps back out of frame.

      stark shadow of possessed Ed which is cast upon the
      wall behind her.  We watch as the shadow of Ash with the
      axe, slices through the top portion of possessed Ed's
      head.  Annie screams as she is splattered with green
      bile.

               Start up that saw and hand it here!
               We're gonna cut him up.

      Annie looks to the chainsaw and then to the unmoving body
      of Ed.  She is repulsed at the thought.

                              ANNIE
               No.

                              ASH

      Jake slowly stands into the empty frame. He is in shock
      from what he has just seen.  Annie slowly rises into
      frame - shaking her head in a silent "No." Ash slowly

      Jake sprays a can of air freshener about the room.
      He holds his nose.  Ash tosses a bloodied sheet,
      containing the remains of possessed Ed to the floor.
      It lands with a sickening thud.  Wiping his face with a
      rag, Ash moves off in disgust.  We hold on the bundled
      sheet as the trap door next to it silently opens.
      Henrietta's rotted hand emerges, unnoticed by the others
      in the room.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Jake, I can't take no more of this.

      Henrietta's rotted hand pulls the bundle of body
      parts silently down into the cellar and quietly
      closes the trap.

                              BOBBY JOE

               That trail we came in here on...
               well, it just ain't there no more.
               Like the woods jus' swallowed it.

      The room goes quiet.  The sound of the wind outside
      the cabin has died.  Jake and Bobby Joe cock their
      heads to this new silence.

      Bobby Joe raises her hand into frame, to reveal Ash's
      Evil Hand clutched in hers.  Bobby Joe goes nuts,
      screaming and flailing about trying to throw the hand
      from her.  She slams into the lantern, knocking it out.
      We lose them in the darkness.

      as she slams into a twisted oak tree that stops her flat.

      An angry face appears on the surface of the tree.  Its
      gnarled bark folds open to reveal very human like oversized
      eyes.  A large fold in its bark opens to form a gaping
      mouth dripping tree sap saliva.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the first passage will
               make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself
               in the flesh.

                              ASH
               Why the hell would we want to do that?

      Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the second passage creates
               a kind of rift in time and space, and
               the physical manifestation of this spirit
               can be forced back through this rift...
               to an earlier time and place.  At least
               that's the best translation I can ....

               If you want to look for her,
               go ahead.

               Those pages don't mean shit.

      Jake kicks the pages down into the cellar.  Ash and

      Jake halts his screaming.  He listens in the silence
      as possessed Ash juts up into the frame!  His eyes
      are bone white, his flesh, the pale color of the dead.
      His lips, black.  He bellows to the night!

      All is quiet outside, no sign of Possessed Ash or
      Jake, and then Possessed Ash is there, emerging from
      the darkness suddenly.  He raises his finger and
      points to Annie.  He speaks in the low garbled voice
      of a demon:

                              POSSESSED ASH

      the monster that is Ash emerges.  He heads toward the
      cabin and disappears in a bank of fog.

509E  MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - ANNIE                             509E

      Annie enters the room.  She shudders from the
      cold.  CAMERA PANS with her glance to broken glass
      upon the floor, and over to reveal the bashed out
      window and the curtains fluttering in the wind.


509F  MEDIUM SHOT - ANNIE                                   509F

      With her back toward us she doesn't notice Ash's hand
      appear suddenly in the foreground atop the writing desk.
      She turns suddenly towards camera.

      Ash's evil hand sits upon the table.  It scampers off.

      He picks her up and swings her across the room, into
      the wall.  She slumps to the floor unconscious.

514   ASH'S POV - STAR FILTER - MIRROR NECKLACE             514

      As he moves closer to her unmoving body.  A glitter of
      light on the floor, next to her, catches his eye.


515   CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH                            515

      For the first time, calm, as he looks intently down at
      the floor.  He kneels closer.


516   ASH'S POV - (STAR FILTER)                             516

      The NECKLACE of Linda.


517   CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH                            517

      The sight of the necklace strikes the human cord
      within him.  He is confused, his evil self, battling
      for control of his spirit and body.  He reaches to
      pick it up.


518   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               518

      As he slowly picks up the delicate silver necklace.
      He raises it to his face;

                              LINDA (V.O.)
               I'll never take it off.

      And then it hits him.  The emotion of love lost. It
      floods the monster that is ASH.  He clutches the
      necklace tightly to his bestial chest.  And as the
      Love/waltz theme sweeps up in volume on the sound
      track, the monster begins to cry.


519   WIDE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH AND ANNIE - TULIP CRANE     519

      Ash raises his head and lets out a low, lamenting, and
      pitiful wail.  A man trapped in the shell of a beast,
      crying for the one he has lost.


520   MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH - 50% POSSESSED     520

      As he raises his head.  Tears stream down from his eyes,

      BLADDER EFX - 50 - 20% POSSESSED

      His face begins to change.  His skin loses its white
      pallor.  His blackened, infected cuts disappear.  The
      swollen and cracked surface of his face begins to heal.

      again human.  Ash looks up suddenly with a start.


524   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - WOODEN AXE HEAD                   524
      EXPLODING FLOOR

      As he rolls out of the way a moment before the head of
      the axe buries itself in the wooden floor.  Splinters
      fly.

      enters frame, charging him with axe, screaming.

                              ASH
               No.  WAIT!

      Annie swings the axe and again Ash ducks.  The head of
      the axe slams into the plastered wall smashing right
      through.


526   CLOSER - ASH AND ANNIE                                526

      Ash grabs her tightly with his remaining hand.

                              ASH
               Listen to me!  I'm all right
               now.  That thing is gone.

      Ash pushes her away.  Annie falls to the floor.  She
      stands.


527   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - WOODEN AXE HEAD                    527
      EXPLODING WALL EFX

      Catching his wind for a moment.  Then rolls to the
      side as the axe again comes at him!  SLAM!  The head
      of the axe slices into the wall only a few inches from
      his head.


528   MED. SHOT - ASH AND ANNIE                             528

      backwards.

                              ASH
               GOD DAMN IT!  I said I was all
               right!!

      Annie is nearly choking.

                              ANNIE
               Okay.

      Ash releases her gently.  She again looks to Ash,
      cautiously.

                              ANNIE
               Are you sure?

                              ASH
               You'll be the first to know.
               I'm fine.

               Yeah, but for how long?
               If we're going to beat this thing,
               we need those pages.


529A  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      529A

      As he turns to the trap door.

               Then let's head down into that cellar...


529B  CLOSE SHOT - TRAP DOOR                                529B

      It lies silently against the floor.  A rasping
      breath can be heard from below.


529C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      529C

      He turns from the trap door to Annie.

               ...And carve ourselves a witch.

      Is tossed down upon the workshed table.


539   A SECOND HOSECLAMP                                    539

      Is tossed down next to the first.


540   ANNIE'S HANDS                                         540

      Hold down a clamp as ASH'S hand, creates screw sized
      holes in it with a battery powered drill.


541   ANNIE'S HANDS                                         541

      Slams down the chainsaw upon the table.  It is missing
      its side panel.  ASH'S arm enters frame and we see that
      it is this missing side panel that has been clamped to

      The panel slides into the side of the chainsaw with a
      sharp "CLICK".

      The "T" shaped end of the starter cord falls neatly
      into the "V" shaped hook that is strapped around Ash's
      neck.

549   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    549

550   WIDE SHOT                                             550

      Ash extends his chainsaw arm, pulling on the starter
      cord.  The CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  With his free arm
      Ash raises the shotgun.  He lowers the blade of the
      chainsaw down upon the barrel.  Sparks fly as the saw
      cuts through it.  The long barrel falls to the floor.
      Ash is left with a sawed off shotgun in one hand and a
      chainsaw strapped to his other arm.

      With a fancy style western flip to the gun Ash saddles
      the shotgun in a makeshift holster, strapped
      to his back.

      The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS into Ash's face.

                              ASH
               Groovy.

      In the distance, the tiny figures of Ash and Annie
      as they move from the workshed to the cabin.  In
      the foreground is a large oak tree.  A gnarled human-
      like face can be made out on the surface of the tree.
      It is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a
      dimmer.  A horrible twisted tree face.  It suddenly
      opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with
      a terrible wheezing sound, as though in great pain
      at being brought to life.  It turns sharply towards
      the cabin.


552   CLOSE SHOT - DINKY PUPPET                             552

      Second tree face, brought up on a dimmer, opens its
      mouth and loudly draws in air, also in agony.


553   CLOSE SHOT - MOE PUPPET                               553

      A third tree's twisted face, two human eyes opened wide
      on its surface.  It breathes, then barks a guttural sound.


554   MED. SHOT - (STUDIO MINIATURE)                        554

      In the foreground is the base of a large oak tree.  The
      cabin in the distance.  A rumbling is heard.  Then
      suddenly the tree pulls one of its massive roots from
      the earth.  The tree sets its root down a few feet closer
      to the cabin.

               Those pages are down there
               somewhere.

      Half hidden in the shadows we see two of the missing
      pages.

      spots another page somewhat deeper into the cellar.

      Annie's voice calls down.

                              ANNIE (O.S.)
               Did you find her?

               She's playing hard to get...

      He pumps the throttle on the buzzing saw.

                              ASH
               ... rid of.

      Behind Ash, unseen by him, a shadow darts by.

      He reaches for the door and opens it.  Revealing
      darkness beyond.  Ash enters.  Again he hears the slight
      sound, a gentle ticking.


578   INT. CELLAR - REAR ROOM - NIGHT - ASH'S POV           578

      The ticking sound is coming from behind a hanging drape.


579   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     579

      He approaches the drape, reaches out his hand and pulls
      it back sharply.  Revealing an old water heater, ticking
      and steaming.


579A  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     579A

      He breathes a sigh of relief as the half eaten skeleton
      torso of Ed falls atop him!  Ash screams and steps suddenly
      away.

                         (In a whisper)
               She got hungry.

      Ash turns from the skeleton and quickly gathers up the
      remaining pages from the Book of the Dead.  Getting
      scared now, he backs into the cellar's front room.

      As they climb. From behind the wooden steps, the
      horrible head of Henrietta appears.  Her two rotting hands
      grab at Ash's ankles.


582   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      582

               Henrietta!

      Her face pulls back behind the cellar steps.  Her
      hands pull ASH's feet in after her.

      As she kneels down at the trapdoor, about to call down
      to Ash when the witchlike figure of Henrietta floats
      quickly up into the main room from the cellar.  A
      flurry of moths about her.

                              HENRIETTA

      As her head springs down into frame and halts suddenly
      inches from his face.  In the silence we hear the reason:

      Annie's voice singing the same melody that her mother
      had sung to her earlier from the cellar.  For a moment
      Henrietta's face loses its evil malice.  She is confused
      at this sound.

      Henrietta halts.  She spins her head toward Annie.

      He unsaddles his sawed off shotgun from the holster on
      his back.  He points the barrel at her head point blank.

                              ASH
               Swallow this.

      He pulls the trigger.  BLAM!  Flame barks from the gun.

      They pull apart and look into each others eyes.  Annie
      holds the pages.  Maybe they can get away after all.  A
      LOUD BOOMING echoes throughout the cabin!  As though the
      outside walls of the place were being bombarded by cannon
      balls.  The kitchen wall behind them buckles.

      moves to her, strokes her hair and begins to cry.

      MED. SHOT - GROUND - ASH - CAR CRANE - DELTA SHELLS

      Plunged to the dust.  Debris from the demolished cabin
      rains down around him; his shotgun, the 1973 Delta 88
      Oldsmobile and the old grandfather clock.


676   ASH'S POV. - THE RIFT IN THE SKY - MITCHELL           676

      As it seals shut, leaving only the blue sky and the
      sound of tweeting birds.  Ash's view of the serene sky
      changes abruptly as five steel helmets jut into his
      line of sight.  Five armor-clad medieval WARRIORS
      stand directly over him.

      As he looks to the warriors above him.

      The first warrior raises a bloodstained longsword
      and poises it above Ash's head.

                              WARRIOR #1
               Slay the beast!

                              WARRIOR #2
               'Tis a deadite!

      All raise their swords ready for the kill.


679   MED. SHOT - THE WARRIORS                              679

      Halt as they hear a piercing, high-pitched SCREECH.
      They turn their heads skyward.


680   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      680

      Follows the Warriors' gaze.

      MED. SHOT

      A "WINGED DEADITE," a female harpy like creature with
      the tail of a sea horse and man-sized bat wings,
      enabling it to fly.  The screaming beast swoops down
      towards the warriors and horses. High above, the distant
      shapes of other Winged Deadites circle.

      reaches behind him.

      As he looks to Ash.


691   MED. SHOT - WARRIORS                                  691

      They follow his gaze.  The CAMERA PANS TO Ash.  He stands
      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering
      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his
      bearings.


692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692

      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange
      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.
      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:

                              WARRIOR #1
               Hail he, who has come from the sky,
               to deliver us from the terrors of
               the deadites!

                              WARRIOR #4
               Hail!

                              WARRIOR #5
               Hail!

      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their
      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.

      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.

      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the "Hero
      from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
      strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
      title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.


The TRACK is SILENT.
 
              The CAMERA looks at a sign.  It reads:
 
                                    CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
                                     Established 1935
 
              Gradually we can begin to hear, in the BG, the SOUNDS of
              CHILDREN playing.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
         2    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY
 
              In the BG a few dozen CHILDREN, in camp uniforms, are enjoying
              a game of softball.
 
              In the FG CLAUDETTE is looking for someone.  CLAUDETTE is 17
              years old.  She is pretty.  She wears a t-shirt with "Assistant
              Counsellor" written on it.  She fills out the shirt very well.
 
              Failing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks
              quickly in the opposite direction.
 
              The CAMERA holds on the game for a few seconds and we
              SUPERIMPOSE:
 
                                       JULY 4, 1958
 
              The CHILDREN'S VOICES FADE slowly.

              ECU as a COUNSELLOR squeezes off a shot.
 
              The paper target is ripped in the black.
 
              The COUNSELLOR hands the weapon to a CAMPER who snaps in at the
              line.
 
              CLAUDETTE shouts up to the COUNSELLOR from the BG.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Have you seen Barry?
 
              The COUNSELLOR smiles.  Shrugs.

                                  COUNSELLOR
                      He and Chloe were at the Lodge last time
                      I saw him.
 
              CLAUDETTE leaves.  The COUNSELLOR smiles.

         4    EXT. MAIN LODGE - DAY
 
              Two CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses.  CLAUDETTE
              passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE.
 
              BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms
              behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE,
              and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with
              cow eyes.  In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out
              an Everly Brothers hit.
 
              BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.  He is not
              ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      We've got to talk.
 
              BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.  Nods.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Okay.
 
         5    BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his
              shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former.
 
              The Everly Brothers continue as we:

         6    EXT. LAKE - DAY
 
              From over the tops of a rack of canoes we see BARRY and
              CLAUDETTE walking along the shore.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      You said we were special.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I meant everything.
 
              In the BG, CHILDREN leap into the water.

                                  BARRY
                            (continuing)
                      You know what I said, though.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      I can't, Barry...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
         7    EXT. FOREST - DAY
 
              The TRACK goes SILENT.
 
              BARRY & CLAUDETTE walk along a path.  This is not an aimless
              walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go.  He leaves
              the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing.
              CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I care very much.
 
              He puts an arm around her and draws her close.  They kiss.
              They separate.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?
 
              BARRY decides to be politic.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I wouldn't know.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Oh, you...
 
              She kisses him and they are locked.
 
              A bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above.
 
              The CAMERA shifts to ANOTHER ANGLE:  Just beyond the thicket of
              lacy vines.  It is a slow tracking shot which gives the
              impression that we are watching the action from the POV of
              another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged
              Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.
 
              This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.
 
              BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her
              breast.  She reaches up to take his hand away.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Claudette...

                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Somebody'll see.
 
                                  BARRY
                      No, they won't...
 
              He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so
              that part of her bra is exposed.  He seals her protesting lips
              by kissing her.
 
              From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle.
              A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear
              the field of vision.  A branch pops.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                            (in a thick whisper)
                      Somebody's there, Barry.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Come on, Claudette.  A man's not made of
                      stone.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Let's go back, Barry...
 
                                  BARRY
                      I need you so much, Claudette.
 
              BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra.  They kiss again,
              passionately.
 
              The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of
              foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as
              the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.
 
              Closer.  The THEME has snuck in.  It becomes discordant.  It
              swells.  Closer.
 
              QUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the
              perspiration streaking their flushed skin.
 
              Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
 
              A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the
              blow.
 
              The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.  The PROWLER's powerful hand has him
              by the throat.  He backpeddles, trying to get away.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree.
 
              A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.

              BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.  The knife falls to
              the mossy floor of the clearing.
 
              Two hands go for the free blade.  BARRY's hand has it.
 
              There is a confused jumble of struggle.
 
              Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  BARRY, horrified by the sight.
 
              The PROWLER's hand has the knife.  It moves quickly forward.
              We can hear the blade strike.
 
              BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.
 
              MCU the moss where the finger fell.  The PROWLER reaches into
              FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.
 
              QUICK CUT TO:  CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors.
              She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her
              temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.  The MUSIC
              has stopped abruptly.
 
              THE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE.
 
              It is completely SILENT.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
         8    TITLE SEQUENCE
 
              The screen is completely black.  A small white shape starts to
              ZOOMS towards the FG.  The shape becomes a three-dimensional
              rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Just as it gets to its final
              position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane
              of glass.  There is a loud crash.  The logo shifts to the upper
              left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black.
 
              The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the
              Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement.
 
              TITLES END and the MUSIC fades out.

              The TRACK is SILENT.
 
              In a LONG SHOT we see the one main street.  A newspaper
              delivery truck drives away from the CAMERA.  A GIRL walks down
              the street.

              Superimposed title:

              We can begin to hear a small-town DJ OVER as a pick-up truck
              moves down the street past the GIRL in her late teens.  She has
              a knapsack, a freshly scrubbed face, jeans, and a plaid shirt.
              She wears her hair in a long braid.  She wears Nike jogging
              shoes.  This is ANNIE.

              The radio is turned way down.  We see that the hand belongs to
              TRUDY, a hefty waitress who wears her golden hair in a bun with
              a pencil stuck in it.  BUDDY, the boss, is seen in the BG
              working the grill.

              The regulars are there:  five MEN and two WOMEN who always come
              in for breakfast.  They are the retailers, the oil delivery
              man, the switchboard operators, and the cop.

              ANNIE steps aside as the OIL MAN heads for the front door.  He
              is smirking.  He's fifty, strong, and balding.  He makes no

                      I don't know.
 
              ANNIE wonders if she should accept the ride with this guy.
              Suddenly, from between two parked cars pops RALPH, a crazy hobo
              who has two dead rats in his mouth, their tails in his teeth;
              they swing from him like a strange beard.

                      Don't worry about him.  He's harmless.

              He pats his rats.

              Branches and briars snap back at us.  Just ahead, the terror-
              stuck ANNIE stumbles and falls.  She screams as a knife flashes
              past her in a blur.
 
              When the knife has passed, all we can see is a look of surprise
              on ANNIE's face.
 
              The CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Her throat has been cut.  She collapses
              out of FRAME.
 
              A bird soars across the sky above.
 
              The TRACK is SILENT.

        26    EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
 
              A gaily decorated camper-van travels along the highway.  We
              hear rock 'n roll OVER coming from a car radio as this much-in-
              need-of-repair vehicle passes a slower car.

        27    INT. CAMPER VAN - DAY
 
              In the camper van are three young people.  They are full of
              fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake.
              They are instantly likeable.
 
              At the wheel is NED, a short 22-year-old whose well-developed
              upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting.  He is nice-
              looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction.
              He is funny and alert.
 
              Next to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as
              American as popcorn.  He is quieter, two years younger and not
              as smart as NED.  He has to think things through.
 
              MARCIE is JACK's girlfriend.  She is leaning over the front
              passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders.

              She is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun.  She
              enjoys every minute of every day.  She hasn't been touched by
              tragedy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
 
                                  NED
                      There you are dead wrong.
 
                                  JACK
                      Ha!
 
                                  NED
                      Sometimes I only think about kissing
                      women.
 
              MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back.
 
                                  JACK
                      Ow!
 
                                  NED
                      I was just wondering if you thought
                      there'd by any other gorgeous women at
                      Camp Crystal Lake.  Besides yourself.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      You are a true pierce of work, Ned.
 
              MARCIE hits NED on the arms, playfully.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      How about our last jay?
 
                                  JACK
                      Good call.
 
              JACK reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a
              joint.
 
                                  NED
                      What about the dope paragraph in Mr.
                      Christy's letter?
 
                                  JACK
                      Quote:  Controlled substances are
                      expressly forbidden.  Possession or use

                                  MARCIE
                      We got two weeks before the kids even
                      arrive.  Then I'll act responsibly.
                      Until then, hit me.
 
              She takes the lighted joint and tokes.

                                  NED
                      Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't
                      seen a coat of paint in six years.

              The CAMERA SEES what NED saw.  The buildings are run down at
              the heels.  It is the same camp we saw in the early scenes, but
              time has torn the place badly.
 
              The van passes the CAMERA and we see the three new ARRIVALS
              looking out the window.

              This is the main building.  It is the building where Barry and
              Claudette met.  Outside is a flagpole, a small parking area, a
              large overhanging tree.
 
              In the BG we can see part of the lake.

              In the FG there is a Jeep.

              An axe flashes through the FRAME and hacks apart the halves of
              a huge tree stump.
 
              The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a middle-aged man in cut-offs,
              a bare chest, hiking boots and beat-up cowboy hat.  This is
              STEVE CHRISTY.  He is strong, charming, and engaging.  He is
              animated, always in motion, impatient with how long it takes to
              do things.
 
              In the BG the van comes to a stop.  No sooner has JACK hopped
              down, than STEVE is beckoning him over.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Wanta give me a hand here?
 
              JACK smiles and comes quickly.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Alice?
 
              NED steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had
              polio when he was a kid.  His upper body is strong, but his
              legs are slightly deformed.  He and MARCIE hustle over to the
              big stump.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.
                      Alice?
 
              ALICE comes into the MS.  She is carrying a shovel and a bucket
              and has obviously been working for a couple of hours.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Cabin B is ready.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Push on this side.  Alice, this is Jack,
                      Marcie and Ned.  Push.
 
              They exchange "hellos" as they bend to the work.

                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      That's got her.  Thanks.  I'm Steve
                      Christy.  Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
                      You got some grubby clothes?  Climb into
                      'em.  Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out
                      the boathouse.  I want him to start with
                      the canoes.  What happened to Brenda?
 
                                  ALICE
                      You told her to sweep the courts.
 
              STEVE sets off.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks.
 
              As soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE.
 
                                  NED
                      I thought we had two weeks...
 
              ALICE shrugs.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You can changed in three.

              The CAMERA looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull
              up.  A brush slaps into view.  BILL is sweating while finishing
              a coat of paint on the last canoe.
 
              BILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.  He rubs his
              long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone
              call his name OS.  He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the
              trail.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Steve said for you to start on the boats.
 
                                  BILL
                      I finished the boats.
 
              ALICE nods slowly.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'll tell him.
 
              She turns away.

                                  BILL
                      Alice?  The others show up?

                      Everybody except the girl who's supposed
                      to handle the kitchen.  Annie.
 
              BILL puts his brush in a coffee can of turps.
 
              ALICE look at him, then turns again.
 
                                  BILL
                      You think you're gonna last all summer?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'm not sure I'll last all week.
                            (pauses)
                      I'll tell Steve.

              dark Eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting
              the wall.  On the other side MARCIE is scraping some flaking
              paint.
 
                                  STEVE

                      To answer your question, my parents once
                      owned this camp.  There were some tragic
                      accidents and they went bankrupt.  I
                      promised them I'd reopen if I could.

              STEVE, ALICE, BRENDA, MARCIE, NED, JACK and BILL are lugging a
              swimming float down to the water's edge.  STEVE supervises as
              he carries the thing, which is quite heavy.  They ad-lid as
              appropriate.  ("There goes my hernia." "Are you sure you're

              aboard for the ride, flipping into a handstand.

              whipped open quickly, letting in the full brightness of the
              sun.  There is a shape.
 
              The CAMERA IRISES DOWN so that we can see that JACK has come in
              on an errand.
 
              As JACK looks around, we can take the time to see that there
              are a half-dozen lantern, a few cans of lantern fuel, a couple
              of hibachis, some entrenching tools packs, portable ice chests,
              etc.  Up on the long side wall are a half-dozen hunting knives
              in sheathes, also hanging neatly.
 
              Suddenly a hand comes into FRAME and touches JACK on the
              shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task.  JACK turns with
              a start.  He looks into the CAMERA.

              REVERSE POV to see MARCIE standing in the doorway.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      What are those for?  An Indian raid?
 
              She points to the row of hatchets and knives.

                      Steve's got a woodlore program.  You see
                      any life rings?
 
              MARCIE looks behind some piled up equipment.  She pulls out two
              rings.

                      Here.  Meet me in my cabin after taps.
                      Okay, Camper?
 
              She kisses him on the cheek and gives him a playful goose.
 
                                  JACK

              STEVE CHRISTY comes upon ALICE, who is renailing floorboards on
              the porch of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  On the railing is a
              sketch pad which Steve thumbs through.
 
              INSERT:  ALICE'S SKETCH.  It is a moody pierce, a sense of
              foreboding dominates it.  Otherwise, it is the camp's central
              compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You draw very well.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more
                      time at it.
 
              ALICE misses a nail and hits her thumb.  She reacts good-
              naturedly and keeps on working.
 
              STEVE bends down next to ALICE.
 
                                  STEVE
                      This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?
 
              She shakes her head.

                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Any particular reason?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Just a feeling.
                            (pause)
                      Nothing personal.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (nodding)
                      You want to leave?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't know.  Probably be best for
                      everybody.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You may not care a lot about this place,
                      Alice, but I mean to make it my whole
                      life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme
                      a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it
                      ready.  Next Friday, if you're not
                      happy, I'll put you on the bus myself.
                      I'll be grateful.
 
              He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek.
 
              She looks up.  She nods.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Next Friday.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Thanks, Alice.
 
              He stands up.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      I've got to go to town and pick up the
                      trailer and all that other stuff, but
                      I'll be back around ten.  If you're
                      still up, we can talk, okay?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Sure.
 
              She watches him cross out of FRAME.

              STEVE is at the wheel of his Jeep.  The COUNSELLORS are
              standing within earshot, huddled around the Jeep.
 
                                  JACK
                      You want it listed separately?

                      Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the
                      archery range.  If Annie gets here, have
                      her start in on the kitchen.  Do your
                      best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary
                      inspection by the state safety people.
                      I'd like to look good.
 
              He wheels the car around and out the driveway.  The others
              stand looking before NED breaks the silence.
 
                                  NED

                      called "Camp Blood" downtown.
 
              They are all getting back to work.
 
                                  ALICE
                      How come?
 
                                  NED
                      Some campers drowned.  Then some

                                  NED
                      Late fifties sometime.  They never
                      caught the guy who did it either.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Neddy collects weird facts.  Next he is

                      snakes in the outhouse and green lizards
                      in the lake.
 
              As they laugh, the CAMERA HOLDS on ALICE.

              BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She
              enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of
              this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated
              than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.
 
              BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter
              and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are
              already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far.
              The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job.
 
              The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets
              closer to setting up the target.
 
              In MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the
              face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the
              weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow
              streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by
              eighteen inches.
 
              BRENDA whips around.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-
              to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked
              simultaneously.  He has a feather stuck in his hair.
 
              She grabs the arrow and storms at him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      You're crazy!
 
              She snaps the arrow in half.
 
                                  NED
                      Did anyone ever tell you you're
                      beautiful when you're angry?
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (plussed)

                      Want to see my trick shot?  It's even
                      better.
 
              BRENDA still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's
              little she can do.  She laughs.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (still laughing)
                      You ever fire one of those bows again,
                      and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.

                      God, but I love that sexy talk.
 
              BRENDA snatches the bow from him, shakes her head and puts the
              bow down next to a collection of wicked-looking arrows.

              This is a fairly large single room.  The walls are bare and
              uninsulated.  There are a few easels, but for the most part,
              the room is dominated by long tables and rough-hewn benches.
 
              The light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey
              wood interior appear silver-colored.  ALICE, her hair in a
              bandana, has just finished sweeping up.
 
              The CAMERA picks up on ALICE's sketch of the central camp area
              on one easel.  On a second easel she has done the preliminary
              sketch of the lake itself.  It is also a moody picture.
 
              ALICE cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a
              little, then goes on to her next task.  There is a row of newly-
              arrived cardboard boxes.  She opens the first in CU with a
              matte knife.  She take out the invoice and checks it against
              the first items:  gimp, the plastic string from which all the
              campers will make lanyards.

              ALICE snaps around, sensing that she is being watched.  In CU
              her frightened face looks at the sun-drenched dusty pane.  Her
              face relaxes until BANG!  The sound of a door slamming echoes
              through the room.
 
              The CAMERA ZOOMS BACK from her face to see someone standing in
              the doorway.
 
              It is BILL.

                                  BILL
                      Sorry.  How you doing?
 
              ALICE smiles, then turns back to her job of taking inventory.
              BILL watches her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Did you want something?
 
              She starts to take a box down from a high shelf.  She doesn't
              realize that there is something on top of the box.
 
                                  BILL
                      Steve said you were thinking of leaving.

              At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of

              Gradually we become aware that this LONG WIDE SHOT is someone's
              POV.  The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held,
              on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight.
 
              Branches, brush, and twigs are butted through.  Occasionally,
              we can see part of the PROWLER's arm fending off the underbrush.

              ALICE is treading water, talking with BRENDA, as NED comes up
              out of nowhere.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Vitamin C's supposed to neutralize the
                      nitrites or something.
 
              NED surfaces between them.  He looks with googly eyes at ALICE.
 
                                  NED
                      There are sand sharks in this lake and
                      they can eat the bathing suit right off
                      you.
 
              ALICE laughs.
 
                                  NED
                            (continuing)
                      See?  I'm getting to you.  Very slowly.
 
              NED does a porpoise drive and disappears.
 
              BRENDA is not laughing.  She is looking off towards the cabin
              area.
 
              ALICE sees her and look where she looks.
 
                                  ALICE
                      What'd you see?
 
                                  BRENDA
                      I don't know.  Marcie's got me paranoid.
 
              She smiles.

        48    EXT. BEHIND ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
 
              The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place
              alongside Alice's cabin.  There is underbrush about two feet
              tall and all around that area.  The PROWLER stops, leans down
              and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.
 
              The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a
              burlap bag which has been secreted there.  The hand lifts the
              bag, which has something in it that moves.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below
              the window.  The window is open, making entry quite simple.

              The PROWLER's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in
              and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake.  One hand has the
              animal firmly behind the jaws.  The hand takes the snake and
              puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white
              coverlet.  It slithers across the bed.
 
              The PROWLER's hand closes the window.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES towards one of the sheds.

              BILL and ALICE are lying on the shore on their towels, watching
              the OTHERS in the water and grabbing some afternoon sun.  ALICE
              is on her stomach, tracing angular designs in the sand.  BILL
              is on his back, listening.
 
                                  BILL
                      It still hurts?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt,
                      but I thought I could stand anything.
                            (pause)
                      I just wasn't ready for that kind of
                      pain.  We were supposed to meet in L.A.
                      When I got back there, he sent a telegram
                      saying he was going back to his wife.
 
              BILL turns over so he can look at her better.
 
                                  BILL
                      What'll you do when you leave here?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't know.
 
              Various feet enter the FRAME.  BILL and ALICE look up to see
              JACK with his arm around MARCIE, NED toweling his head, and
              BRENDA putting on her blue workshirt.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Pistachio, fudge ripple, creme de menthe
                      and I are going back to work.
 
              BILL gets up.
 
                                  BILL
                      Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm
                      ready.  Frozen yogurt?

              ALICE smiles at the reference.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'll be along.
 
                                  NED
                            (in a nelly voice)
                      Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll
                      scratch your eyes out...
 
              They head off.  ALICE turns over to tan her front.

              A machete rips through some vines.  Again it hacks at the brush.
 
              PULLS BACK to reveal BILL clearing away the years of vine
              growth which have choked off a path.  He wipes the perspiration
              from his eyes and continues along.

              Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There
              are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's
              an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights
              made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement.
 
              ECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression.  He
              explodes his breath.
 
              We PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven
              parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt
              about his strength.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Not bad.
 
              As NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat
              little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take.
 
                                  NED
                      Holy shit...

                      We wouldn't want you thinking you're the
                      only show-off in camp, would we?

              The sun has dropped lower on the horizon.
 
              The CAMERA looks down on ALICE as she sleeps peacefully in the
              late sun.  A shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with
              a start.
 
              CUT BACK to see BILL standing over her with a machete.
 
                                  ALICE

                      Almost five.
 
              ALICE gets up.

                      Now I'm only eleven hours behind
                      schedule.  Steve is going to have a

              ALICE is walking quicker than BILL.  We realize we have seen
              this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it.
 
                                  BILL
                      You can only do what you can do.
 
                                  ALICE
                      And then Steve looks at you with those
                      hurt eyes--like you don't care about
                      children...
 
              BILL laughs at her imitation.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      I'll see you later.
 
              She turns to go up the steps to her front door.
 
                                  BILL
                      Alice?
 
              She stops and look down at him.  He is serious and he cares.

              ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.  She knows that it
              wasn't easy for BILL to say.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're very nice.
 
              They share a short silent moment.
 
                                  BILL
                      Hope you will.
 
              BILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long
              blade.
 
              ALICE watches him go.  She shrugs.  This might be a good place
              to stay.  She turns and goes into her cabin.

              In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake
              is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.
 
              ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has
              been since we met her.
 
              The room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden
              dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light
              blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all
              the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on
              in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.
 
              ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what
              she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little
              sexier.  She smiles at herself.
 
              She reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel.
 
              ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens
              it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe.
 
              She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.

              ALICE walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a
              towel-turban.  She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for
              her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled
              hair fall down.
 
              She hums.  Opens her top drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes!  It flails
              at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier
              as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the
              bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake
              falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.
 
              There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.
              Her scream is loud.

              BILL runs into the room, still carrying his machete.  He looks
              at ALICE.

                            (a tight whisper)
                      There's a fucking snake in here.

              BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward.
              Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the
              machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto
              the floor.
 
              MARCIE and JACK enter.  JACK carries a shovel as a weapon.
              MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further
              to see the blood and guts.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Steve never mentioned serpents.  Jack,
                      would you get some paper towels?
 
              JACK nods and exits.

                      Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of
                      your perfume.
 
              JACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      You okay now?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
              BILL gives her an extra hug.  Then steps back awkwardly,
              stepping on MARCIE's big toe.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Go ahead.  I walk on 'em all the time.
                            (to JACK)
                      Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?
 
              JACK nods.  He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets
              underneath the wide-fanged snake.
 
              MARCIE begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper
              toweling.

              Looking across the lake, we can see the camp, nestled in among
              the late afternoon rays of the sun.  We can hear the sounds of
              the nocturnal animals beginning to rise and hunt.

        60    INT. CAMP KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              The kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the
              same room, cut off by a partition.  The kitchen has a couple of
              sinks, a heavy old stove, long shelves, a pantry/larder, and
              some windows which look out on the rear.
 
              BRENDA is making a salad for herself.  She is a vegetarian.
              MARCIE is making a guacamole dip.
 
              In the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table.
              JACK and BILL are playing.
 
                           BRENDA                        JACK
                   She all right?                Get ready for the schneider.
 
                           MARCIE                        BILL
                   Yeah.  Scared the hell out    No chance.
                   of her.
                                                         JACK
                           BRENDA                Four zip.
                   How'd it get in the drawer?
 
              ALICE walks into the kitchen.  She has washed her face after
              getting her act together.  She stands in the doorway to the
              kitchen.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      How you doin'?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Okay.  Can I help?
 
                                  BRENDA
                      It's catch as catch can.  I'm making a
                      salad.  The guys are planning to cook
                      greaseburgers for themselves.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      There's a lot of dishes if you just want
                      something to do.
 
              ALICE smiles.  Nods.

                                  ALICE
                      The way I feel, that's perfect.
 
              ALICE goes to the sink and begins to work her way through the
              dirty dish pan.
 
              NED comes flying through the door dressed in various bits and
              pieces of old Indian costumery.  He does a bad dance.
 
              JACK and BILL quit their game and come to the doorway.
 
                           JACK                          BILL
                   What the hell?                Where'd you get that stuff?
 
                           MARCIE                        BRENDA
                   Oh, Lord!                     Neddy!
 
                           JACK
                   It's gonna be a long summer.

                      Wait, wait!   When I was finding these
                      goodies in the shed.  I also found this
                      letter which a camper never sent home.
                      Listen.
 
              He takes a letter out of his breechclout.  He pretends to read,
              when really we can see that the paper is blank.

                      except for the strange man who flies at
                      night and sucks our counsellor's body...
 
              ALICE leans against the sink and laughs.  She is a very pretty
              girl, younger than she first appeared.
 
                                  NED
                            (continuing)
                      And, Mommy, we really love our counsellor.
                      He says that whenever I'm scared, I can
                      sleep in his bunk with him.
 
              JACK and BILL laugh.
 
              NED takes off his headdress.

                      you sneak around in the bushes wearing
                      that?  What's to eat?

                      Whatever you make yourself.
 
              ALICE looks up from her dishes and cocks her head to the side.
              Does she sees something?
 
              The CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to look over her shoulder.
 
              The window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but
              there is something standing there out by a cabin.  But it
              stands, doesn't move... Is it a building?
 
              CUT AWAY to see ALICE using her dishcloth to clear the glass.
              When we CUT BACK, the shape is gone.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  Curious.  A cold chill...
 
              ALICE looks around at the others who are still adlibbing about
              food.
 
                           BRENDA                        JACK

              ALICE looks up.  Pulls the light cord in the middle of the room.
 
              The bulb does not light.
 
              ALICE pulls it again.
 
                                  BILL

                      generator.  The town power lines are
                      supposed to be real shitty.

              JACK turns to BILL.
 
                                  JACK
                      Give me a hand?

        61    INT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              JACK steps in and, in CU, we see there is a puddle where he is
              standing.  The puddle is somehow significant.
 
              BILL leans over JACK's shoulder to see what he's doing.
 
                                  BILL
                      This is almost like the one at my
                      uncle's cabin in Maine.
 
                                  JACK
                      Here we go.
 
              The CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.  In a REVERSE POV we
              see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he
              concentrates.  He bites down on it.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as JACK pulls the starter cord.  The engine
              roars into action.
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Now ya' close the switch.
 
              CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal
              switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a
              perfect connection running through his body.  There is a
              sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK
              screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are
              streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet
              shoes.
 
              BILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and
              continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims
              at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop-
              kick on his friend, severing the contact.

              JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The
              machine stops.

        62    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              JACK lands, almost unconscious.  BILL kneels into FRAME and
              cheeks JACK's vital sign:  his eyes, his carotid pulse, his
              breathing.
 
              JACK shakes his head.
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll be okay.  Holy shit...
 
                                  BILL
                      Don't get up.  Take a second...
 
              JACK lies back down.  Covers his eyes with his arm.
 
                                  JACK
                      You saved my life.
 
                                  BILL
                      I had to.
 
                                  JACK
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd
                      have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that
                      would have ruined my appetite.
 
              JACKS looks up and smiles.  BILL give him a hand and the groggy
              athlete gets to his feet.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whew.
 
              Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and
              looks in.
 
              We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred
              switch and a now-silent generator.
 
                                  BILL
                      This puddle was enough to ground you all
                      the way to China.
 
              JACK looks in, too.

                                  JACK
                      Floor probably leaks.  This area is full
                      of springs.
 
                                  BILL
                      A short somewhere.
 
              BILL leans down and sees a smokey-colored wire that touches
              another wire.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      There's the problem, Jack.  Wire worked
                      itself loose.
 
              He starts to wind it round a set-screw in CU.
 
                                  JACK
                      Just in cause this bugger goes bad.  I'm
                      gonna pick up some lanterns from the
                      equipment shack.
 
              JACKS walks away.

              The door opens at us, letting in the limited light.  JACK comes
              in and goes to pick up a fluorescent lamp.  He flicks it on.
              As he bends down to pick up two Coleman lanterns, the CAMERA
              slowly moves toward the wall where once we saw all the hatchets
              and knives.  They are all missing.
 
              JACK takes his booty and exits.
 
              The light is gone and we are alone in the dark.

              Suddenly ALICE cries out.  Everybody whips around to see.
              ALICE holds up a piece of broken glass--the bottom half of a
              bottle.  She has cut her finger.  It is not a serious cut, but
              the blood is visible.

                           MARCIE                        NED
                   You okay?                     Those things can be nasty.
 
                           BRENDA
                   Wash it out real good.
 
              BILL comes up to ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Lemme see.  Doesn't look too bad.
 
              That said, the OTHERS go back to what they were doing.
 
              BILL and ALICE are featured even though we can hear the others.
              BILL takes great care and puts the BandAid on ALICE's finger.

              They share this moment with soft smiles as the trivia contest
              continues.
 
                                  NED
                      Who played the role of Gorgon in Star
                      Trek?
 
                           BILL                          BRENDA
                   I don't want you getting      Melvin Belli.
                   hurt.
                                                         NED
                           ALICE                 Aaaargh!  That my
                   I was careless.               guaranteed winner!
 
                           BILL                          MARCIE
                   How'd it get in there?        Melvin Belli?
 
                           ALICE
                   Somebody probably dropped
                   something too hard.
 
                                  NED
                      Alice, you're just lucky there are no
                      snakes in the dishwater here.
 
              NEDDY is hovering over a bowl of California dip which MARCIE
              has just made.  He dips a chip as soon as she steps back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy.
 
              Suddenly NED's face goes red.  His eyes bulge out.  He grabs
              his throat and gags.  Coughs, can't clear it.
 
                                  JACK
                      What is it?
 
                                  BILL
                      Is it stuck?
 
              NED points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he
              writhes about.
 
                           MARCIE                        ALICE
                   Help him!                     Oh, my God!
 
                           BILL                          JACK
                   Roll him over!                Get behind him more.
 
              As BILL and JACK flip him over to try to give him the Heimlich,
              NED stops his act and grins from ear to ear.  It's a big finish:
 
                                  NED
                      Ta-da!

              REACTION SHOTS: as it sinks in that NED has been putting them on.
 
                                  JACK
                      Not funny, Ned...
 
              BILL stands up, angry, but willing to keep his mouth shut.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Wait'll you're really in trouble and see
                      what happens...
 
                                  NED
                      But it's in the brochure!  "Camp Crystal
                      Lake has a full drama program."  You
                      just saw it.
 
              NED tries to laugh it off.  They shake their heads.  MARCIE
              walks away.  JACK looks at BILL.
 
                                  BILL
                      Chance to get even?
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll spot you five points.
 
                                  NED
                      Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'll never do it
                      again.
 
              NED turns and heads for the door.  ALICE comes up next to him.
              The OTHERS are out of earshot now.  BILL and JACK play a little
              ping-pong.  NED is a little embarrassed by his play-acting
              stunt.
 
                                  NED
                            (continuing)
                      I'm sorry.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Ned?  We're gonna be working together
                      for a while.  You're a nice guy without
                      all the entertainment, okay?
 
              NED relaxes.  Nods.  He knows what she means.  He turns to look
              at the others.
 
                                  NED
                      Tell 'em I'm sorry?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Sure.

                                  NED
                      I'm gonna go lie down and catch some
                      z's.  Today wiped me out.
                            (pause)
                      Thanks, Alice.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're welcome.
 
              The CAMERA stays on ALICE's face as NED exits.  In the BG,
              MARCIE speaks.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I hope that's the last time we see the
                      Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program.

        65    EXT. MAIN CAMP AREA - EVENING
 
              We watch NED come away from the main cabin and walk moodily
              toward his cabin.
 
              The CAMERA stays with the troubled child as he stops, leans
              down, picks up a pebble and skips it off into the brush.  It
              cuts through.  He flips a few stones in his hand.
 
              NED looks off.  Sees something.
 
              WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:  a shape--a human shape--standing by a
              cabin.
 
              NED walks towards it.
 
                                  NED
                      Hello?  Can I help you?

        66    INT. KITCHEN AREA - EVENING
 
              ALICE is just drying her hands.  She stands next to a giant
              stack of clean dishes and pots.
 
              BRENDA is reading a magazine while picking at some cauliflower
              and cucumber slices.
 
              BILL and JACK saunter in.
 
                                  JACK
                      You just had some lucky shots.

                                  BILL
                      Where's Ned?
 
                                  ALICE
                      He went to bed early.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I don't blame him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      He's probably setting up another one of
                      his practical jokes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Yeah, like draining the lake!
 
              They laugh.
 
                                  JACK
                            (to MARCIE)
                      Hey, how about a walk by the lake?
 
              The OTHERS all go "Ooooooooh."
 
                                  JACK
                            (continuing)
                      Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (kidding)
                      Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy
                      small-minded people around here.
                            (to JACK)
                      Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and
                      be right with you.
 
              MARCIE puts an arm through JACK's arm and they exit.
 
              The OTHERS laugh.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        67    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - NIGHT
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk across the pint needles towards the lake.
              There is the low rumble of thunder preceeded by a faint glow on
              the horizon.
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk along the shore to the lake.  They have
              turned on the flashlights which they carry with them.

                                  JACK
                      Wind's up.  It's shifted a good hundred
                      and eighty degrees.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
 
                                  JACK
                      I love you.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I love you.
 
              They kiss.  MARCIE pulls back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      What about Neddy?
 
                                  JACK
                      I don't love Neddy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Ned!
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Don't call him.
 
                                  JACK
                      I thought you wanted to give him one of
                      your motherly lectures.  Ned is gonna do
                      whatever he wants to do, you know.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I guess...
 
              The moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light.
 
                                  JACK
                      Looks like a storm.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I'm a little scared of storms.  Always
                      have been.  Since I was a kid.
 
                                  JACK
                      You?  The brick?
 
              JACK shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie
              shadows.  She flashes hers at him.

                                  MARCIE
                      I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a
                      dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm.
                      The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can
                      hear the sound.  I try to close my ears
                      off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets
                      louder.  The rain turns to blood and the
                      blood washes down in little rivers.  And
                      the sound stops.
 
              A loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart.  MARCIE is
              startled and reaches out for her lover.
 
                                  JACK
                      It's just a dream.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I call it my shower dream.
 
              They look at one another in the two lights.  They grin.  Rain
              drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them.
 
                                  JACK
                      This is no dream.  Want to escape for a
                      while?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Lead the way!
 
              JACK turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin.  MARCIE is only
              a half step behind, laughing.
 
              FROM A DISTANT ANGLE we watch them run.  There is no theme,
              just the rumble of thunder...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        68    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and
              JACK and MARCIE rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the
              nearest bed.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Are you wet?
 
                                  JACK
                      Just a little.  Wait a minute, woman.
 
              He reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points
              straight up and gives them some light to see by.

              They go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by MARCIE's
              hand coming up from behind JACK and tugging his t-shirt up
              towards his head.  He leans back and takes it off, and tosses
              it at the CAMERA.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        69    EXT. FRONT OF MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The rain has gathered in intensity.  ALICE comes up to the
              front door and looks out.  BILL comes up behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
 
                                  BILL
                      Not if they're where I think they are.
 
              ALICE laughs.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'm not always this stupid.
 
              She turned back into the cabin.

              TIGHT on JACK and MARCIE as they make love under a camp
              blanket.  Their breathing and noises are heard just above the
              sounds of the rain outside.
 
              The CAMERA becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have
              leaked from the ceiling, hit the vertical member of the bed and
              dribbled down.  As the bed shakes with its love-making, the
              CAMERA PANS up the bunk's strut to trace the droplet's course.
 
              As the CAMERA PANS UPWARD, it pulls back slightly and we see
              NED lying in the upper bunk.  In a flash of lightning we
              realize he is dead:  his throat has been slashed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  JACK and MARCIE lie completely still beneath
              their blanket.  The CAMERA PANS along their quiet bodies.
              MARCIE's face is contented.  JACK is ready to doze off.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Mmmmmmmph?
 
                                  JACK
                      Mmmmmmmph.

                                  MARCIE
                      Best over...
 
                                  JACK
                      Umhummmmph.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Like waves.  It's never been likes waves
                      before.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whassamatta?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Gotta pee.  You're lying on my bladder.
 
              She rolls over and grabs her underpants and t-shirt.  While
              still on the bottom bunk, she puts herself into her limited
              clothing.  JACK gives her room.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (dressing)
                      I know this ain't very romantic, but
                      what can I say?  I don't want to explode.
 
              She grabs a flashlight, scoots to the door and is gone.
 
              JACK lies back and puts his hands under his hand.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        71    EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - NIGHT
 
              MARCIE runs across the now-wet central area towards the
              bathroom facility.  She tries to skip between the raindrops,
              but she knows she'll get a drenching.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        72    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              JACK rolls to his side, picks up a small hand-rolled cigarette
              and lights it.  He inhales deeply, rolls on his back.
              Something overhead catches his eye.
 
              Across the way from the row of toilet stalls is a row of shower
              stalls, and further down is a row of several sinks and mirrors.
              We hear the toilet flush.
 
              We CUT INSIDE the toilet booth as MARCIE stands reading the
              graffiti to herself.  We can only see her from the chest up.

                                  MARCIE
                            (reading)
                      "Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie
                      Makit."  "The Yellow Stream by I.P.
                      Daley."  Not the most original stuff,
                      kids.
 
              There is a noise outside the stall.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?
 
              She hears no response and assumes that her imagination is
              playing tricks with her.  MARCIE picks up the flashlight and
              exits the stall.
 
        73    MARCIE crosses to the row of sinks, stops, puts the
              flashlight down and turns on the water faucet.  There is
              no water.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              PROWLER'S POV:  of MARCIE.
 
              From the end of the row of showers, we watch MARCIE bend under
              the sink and turn on one of the spigots.  Water rushes into the
              sink.
 
        74    MCU MARCIE:  She rinses her hands, shakes them dry and
              turns off the water.  Again she hears a noise.  She looks
              to the row of showers and smiles.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Jack?
 
              The screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut.
 
              MARCIE looks over, smiles.  She thinks someone is trying to
              scare her.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?  Neddy?  Don't put me on.
 
              There is a dripping sound.  MARCIE stops at the first shower,
              hesitates.
 
              Throws back the first curtain.  There is no one there.  She
              reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off.
 
              She goes to the second shower, looks over her shoulder to the
              empty toilet.  Then reaches in to the shower curtain.

                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Allee allee infree!
 
              She throws back the curtain.  Again no one is there.
 
              She breathes a sigh of disappointment.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Must be my imagination.
 
              In CU she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the
              TRACK explodes with a MUSICAL STINGER.  It happens in a flash.
              A shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first
              shower.  A hatchet glints.  MARCIE screams.  The hatchet
              strikes.  The flashlight clatters to the floor.

              The sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an
              establishing shot of the diner.  Through the window, which are
              being pelted with rain, we can see a WAITRESS and some CUSTOMERS
              seated on stools at the counter.

        76    INT. DINER - NIGHT
 
              The WAITRESS is different from the morning woman, slightly
              older, but still attractive.  She says good night to her
              CUSTOMER, who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the
              counter.  Seated there is STEVE CHRISTY, finishing his cup of
              coffee.  The waitress, SANDY, picks up his empty pie plate and
              tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Anything else you want?
 
                                  STEVE
                      No, thanks.  I'm fine.  Sandy.
 
                                  SANDY
                      You can't go back there tonight.  Not in
                      that stuff.  'Less you wanta get drownded.

                            (drinking quickly)
                      I got to.

                                  SANDY
                      Aw.
 
              SANDY likes STEVE and enjoys flirting with him.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I have six new counsellor up there.
                      They're all babes in the woods in every
                      sense of the word.
 
                                  SANDY
                      They'll be okay if they know enough to
                      stay in outta the rain.
 
 
                      How much do I owe you?
 
                                  SANDY
                      One night on the town.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I mean...
 
                                  SANDY
                      ...I know what you mean.  Two and a
                      quarter.  Plus fifteen percent tip to
                      make up for me spending the night alone.
 
              STEVE pays up and walks to the cash register.
 
                                  SANDY
                            (continuing)
                      You got a roof for that Jeep?
 
              She rings up the money.  Gives him his change.  He hands her a
              tip.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Yeah.  I got it on before this--
                            (indicates the storm outside)
                      --all started.
 
                                  SANDY
                      That's thirty percent.
 
                                  STEVE
                      For two lonely nights.
 
              She smiles and is really kind of pretty underneath all that
              extra makeup.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Drive careful and don't drownd your dumb
                      self.

              STEVE smiles and leaves.  She watches, then counts her changes
              and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day.

              and starts it up.  He roars off through a big puddle, splashing
              water towards the CAMERA.  The Jeep pulls a small equipment
              trailer.

              of the fire.  BILL stands to the left of the hearth, picks up
              a couple of pieces of dry woods and puts them on to burn.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      You think they fell asleep?

                      Anything's possible.  My parents taught
                      me to leave sleeping lovers alone.
 
                                  ALICE
                      It wouldn't matter except Steve should be
                      getting back pretty soon.  It wouldn't
                      look so great if he fell over them.

                                  BILL
                      Good point.

                      Long enough for me.
 
              They laugh.

                      Give them a little while longer.  It's

              From his POV we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay
              ahead of the rain.  Beyond them the headlights make a slight
              dent in the night.
 
              In the BG we hear a country station on the radio, but it is
              bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical

                      Got to it just in time.  The generator
                      was running on fumes.  I filled it up.
                      That should keep it humming until Steve
                      gets back.

                      Good night, Brenda.
 
              BRENDA takes her lantern, and, throwing the slicker over her
              head like a portable tent, she races off into the night.
 
              ALICE watches her go.  A glimmer of lightning outlines her as
              she heads off.

                      Absolutely.
 
 
 
              She walks with him as he carries the tray of empty coffee cups
              into the kitchen.

        84    INT. CAMP BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              The door opens and BRENDA comes in with her lantern and
              slicker.  Her actions are direct and business-like.
 
              BRENDA goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in
              the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an
              examination lamp.  She takes out a toothbrush and some other
              toilet articles.
 
              She flips on both faucets and nothing comes out.  She put her
              lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves.  She
              stands up, and washes her hands and face.

              She turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound
              that Marcie had heard.  BRENDA looks off at the shower stalls,
              shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              STEVE's Jeep coughs, sputters, stalls.  OVER we can hear him
              trying to re-start his dead engine.  R-r-r-r...

              STEVE angrily steps on the gas again and hits the starter.
              R-r-r-r-rrr... nothing...
 
              He looks up to see headlights coming at him in his rear view
              mirror.
 
              STEVE, wearing a yellow slicker, gets out of the Jeep to try to
              flag down the oncoming car.

              STEVE smiles to see that the oncoming car is the local police
              car, driven by a middle-aged cop named TIERNEY.  TIERNEY has
              the window down already.
 
                                  TIERNEY
                      I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
 
                                  STEVE
                      I think water got into the electrical
                      system.  You ride me back to camp?  I'll
                      get one of my counsellors to drive me
                      back tomorrow morning.
 
                                  TIERNEY
                      Why not?
 
              STEVE is around the car and hopping in almost before TIERNEY
              can answer.
 
                                  TIERNEY

                      "To serve and protect" don't mean to

              He puts the car in gear and roars into the night.

              Under a single hanging lightbulb, BRENDA finishes writing at a
              small table.
 
              The weather howls outside.  There's a tapping sound.  BRENDA
              looks up.  Listens, yawns, then gets up and starts to take off
              her clothes.

              The tapping returns.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      That could drive a person bug-city.
 
              The SOUND is apparently coming from the front of the cabin;
              perhaps she can fix it without getting too wet.
 
              BRENDA grabs her slicker and heads out.
 
              The CAMERA FOLLOWS BRENDA through the darkened cabin to the
              front door.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              There is a small roof overhang like a porch, affording some
              protection from the wind and wet.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER:  as BRENDA hears the tapping sound
              closer by.  She looks and sees.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  somebody has ties a kitchen knife to a
              string and left it dangling from the eaves.  The wind blows,
              making the knife tap against the building.

                                  BRENDA
                      Neddy?  Cut the screwing around, Neddy!
 
              She grabs the knife, breaking the string.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (continuing)
                      This isn't even half funny.
 
              Angry, BRENDA turns and goes back inside the cabin.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

                                  BRENDA
                      Christ, what a jerk.
 
              The single bulb goes out.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (continuing)
                      Great.  Now what?
 
              BRENDA crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a
              match.  She fires up the propane lantern.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (continuing)
                      Looks like I turn in early.
 
              She moves the lamp and gets ready to climb into her bed.  She
              reaches down and takes the coverlet and tugs it clear,
              revealing something that has been left there.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  Fear spreads across her face.
 
              REVERSE POV:  WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  A camp hatchet lies across
              her pillow.  The shiny blade is marked with blood.
 
              BRENDA turns and runs from her room.

              The softball field is now lit.  BRENDA is confused.  She looks
              off behind the backstop.  Then to center field.  Confused, she
              runs out of the light into the darkness and underbrush behind
              third base.  The CAMERA slowly zooms in on the darkness where
              BRENDA exited.  We hold on that spot for several seconds.
              Finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream.  Then
              another.

                      It sounded like Brenda.

                      I'll go take a look.

                      Did somebody leave the lights on at the
                      softball field?
 
              We are looking over at her shoulder.  The distant glimmer
              suddenly goes dark.  BILL joins her and looks.

              ANGLE on BILL and ALICE:  (as before).  Their faces are serious.

                            (continuing)
                      What the fuck is going on here?

              The rain slants down as BILL and ALICE make their way towards
              Jack's cabin.  They go to the door.  BILL knocks.
 
                                  BILL
                      Jack?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Marcie?
 
                                  BILL
                      Hey, guys!
 
              BILL opens the door to the cabin.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       104    INT. JACK'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The door opens at us.  We see the silhouetted figures of BILL
              and ALICE.  BILL flips on the light switch.
 
              The cabin is empty.  Jack's backpack lies on the bed, the
              contents neatly laid out.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       105    INT. CAMP BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              It is dark inside.  The door slams open at us as BILL and ALICE
              make their way inside.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Marcie?  Brenda?  Jack?
 
              BILL walks slowly towards the row of toilets and showers.

                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      I think we should call the police, Bill.
 
              BILL, who was just about to open one of the toilet stalls, nods
              and turns back to ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Okay.
 
              They exit.  There is a beat... and then a slickered shape
              passes between us and the night sky light which comes through
              the windows.  The shape is dragging something.

       106    EXT. OFFICE CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE and BILL are on the porch of one of the cabins.  To the
              left of the door is a small sign that reads:  "Office."  BILL
              tries the door, but cannot open it.
 
                                  BILL
                      Sucker's locked.  Who's got the key?
 
              ALICE ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and
              comes up with a short 2x4.  She crosses to the door and smashes
              through one of the window panes.  She puts her arm through the
              broken glass, unlocks the door and enters.  BILL follows.
 
              The CAMERA continues to watch them from outside the cabin.
              They turn on a light and cross to a phone on Steve Christy's
              desk.  BILL picks up the receiver, listens, clicks the switch
              on the desk set several times.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      It's dead.  Try the pay phone.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Do you have a dime?  A quarter?
 
                                  BILL
                      No.  There must be some in the desk
                      somewhere.
 
              They fumble through the desk to find some change.  BILL finds
              some in the postage drawer.  He then crosses over to a pay
              phone mounted on the wall.  The CAMERA moves to the cornice of
              the building where the phone line exits.  It follows the link
              up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and
              phone lines come in from the pole.  Here we see a dangling
              phone cable which has been recently cut.

              OVER, we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead
              telephone.
 
                                  ALICE (V.O.)
                      Hello?  Hello?  This damn thing's dead,
                      too.

              BILL and ALICE comes out into the rain, heading for the camper
              van.  They hop in.

       108    EXT. VAN/PARKING LOT - NIGHT
 
              BILL slides behind the wheel.  The keys are in the ignition.
              ALICE hops in on the passenger side.
 
              BILL turns over the engine.  It grinds away but does not catch.
 
              From an ANGLE behind the outside mirror, we hear the engine
              fail to catch.  We look in the mirror and see someone standing
              in the distance, watching.
 
              BILL gets out of the driver's side.  Slams the door.  The
              CAMERA TRUCKS with him as he opens the door to the engine.
              ALICE joins him as he shines his light on the engine.
 
                                  ALICE
                      What's the matter with it?
 
                                  BILL
                      Wet.  I don't know.
 
              He tries a few more times.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Why don't we run?  Just run now?
 
                                  BILL
                      It's over twenty miles to the
                      crossroads.  Steve'll be back in an
                      hour.  Things will straighten out then.
                      We'll take his Jeep and get help.
 
              He goes to her and cradles her face in his hands.

                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      Don't worry.  There is probably some
                      really stupid explanation for all this.
                      When the sun comes up tomorrow, you'll
                      smile.
                            (pause)
                      Promise.
 
              ALICE nods.

              In the FG we see a camp sign.  In the BG we see a figure
              running towards us.
 
              The figure reaches our vantage point and is revealed as STEVE
              CHRISTY.  Just as he's about to make the turn into the
              driveway, he looks up and smiles.  He stops and catches his
              breath as the other person catches him in the light of a
              flashlight.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Hi.  What are you doing out in this mess?
 
              He shields his eyes from the light.

              BILL sits on the chair, a rifle across his lap.  In the BG,
              ALICE sits on the couch, dozing.  On the coffee table in front
              of her is a large machete.

              BILL's eyes are closing.  He jerks himself awake, then starts
              to doze again.
 
              The bulb overhead grows yellow, orange, and then goes out.
 
              BILL snaps awake.  He grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks
              it on.
 
                                  BILL
                      Oh, shit....
 
              He goes to the ping-pong table where he has placed some
              lanterns.  He fires up a Coleman and places it on the pong
              table.
 
              BILL checks on ALICE, makes sure she's asleep, then exits,
              carrying his rifle and a battery-operated fluorescent lamp.
 
              HOLD on ALICE's peaceful face as she slumbers.

              The rain has lessened a bit.  BILL approaches the shed with his

              The generator stands there quietly.  BILL comes into view,
              spraying the interior with lamplight.
 
              In the FG a broken sparkplug which BILL does not see immediately.
              It has been smashed by the blow of a hammer.
 
              BILL goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top.  He looks
              in--there is enough gas.  He puts the cap back on.
 
              Then his eye catches something.  He looks at the broken plug.
              He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it.  He
              puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed.

                      Bill?!
 
              She gets her bearings and looks around.  Stands up.  She looks
              at the bulb overhead.  Pulls its string.  No light.
 
              She sees the lanterns which have been placed around.

              Now that she has figured out where Bill must be, she relaxes a
              little.  Smiles.  She goes to the mantelpiece, takes the lantern,
              and walks into the kitchen.

              ALICE puts down the lamp and goes about filling a big old tea
              kettle with water.  She puts it on the stove and pops on a
              burner and prepares two cups of instant coffee.
 
              Impatient and curious, she walks to the front door of the cabin
              and looks out.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill?  Bill?
 
              The calm which she had grasped a few moments before is beginning
              to desert her.

              ALICE takes the kettle off the flame.
 
              The whistling stops abruptly.  ALICE pours water into the two
              cups.  She stirs the coffee.
 
              Unable to contain her impatience any longer, ALICE picks up her
              lantern, grabs a slicker, and heads out the door.

       119    EXT. MAIN CABIN AREA - NIGHT
 
              ALICE walks very quickly around the side of the cabin, headed
              for the generator shed.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill!

              The door to the shed is closed.  ALICE looks around and then
              puts a hand on the hand.  In CU we see the hand pull.  The door
              doesn't budge.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE decides to pull harder.
 
              She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs.  She pulls
              until she finally wrenches the door open.  The lamp casts long
              shadows upwards.
 
              The generator sits silent.
 
              ALICE leans into the shed to look.
 
              The CAMERA TRACKS very slowly around behind her so that we can
              see behind the right-hand corner of the building.  As we clear
              the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down
              from a branch above.
 
              The something turns slowly in the wind.  It is BILL--dead--in
              a travesty of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, shot with arrows.
 
              ALICE comes out of the shed, distraught.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill?
 
              She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  She is riveted with horror, unable to
              move or turn or run.  The SOUNDTRACK screams with the THEME,
              the insistent STINGER, a shriek and a thunderclap.
 
              ALICE finally gives voice to her terror--again and again.  She
              turns, leaving the lantern, and runs back towards the main
              cabin.

                                  ALICE

              ALICE races to the coffee table, looking for BILL's machete.
              It is not there.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The knife!
 
              She gets down on her hands and knees to look for it.
 
              LOW ANGLE:  as she scrabbles on all fours.  Nothing under the
              couch.
 
              ALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the
              lamp.
 
              Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a
              window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass,
              shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE.
 
              It is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced.
 
              ALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front
              door.
 
              ALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited
              figure.
 
              ALICE screams.  The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp.
 
              When ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early
              forties.  She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking.
              This is MRS. VOORHEES.  She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long
              enough to tell her what the matter is.  ALICE sobs incoherently,
              pointing back to the rear window.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      There now, my dear.  Please.  I can't
                      help you if you can't talk to me.
                      There, there now...
 
              ALICE allows the woman to lead her back into the room.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES leads ALICE to the couch.  In the BG we can see
              the broken window, but BRENDA is not visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      He's dead... She's dead... all dead...
                      Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh
                      my God, oh my God... oh God...
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It will be all right.  I'll take care of
                      you.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack?  Marcie?  Ned?
 
              MRS. VOORHEES comforts her with a strong arm.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It's just this place.  The storm.
                      That's why you're all upset.
 
                                  ALICE
                      No, no, they're all dead...
 
              ALICE points over her shoulder towards the ping-pong table
              without looking.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks, shrugs.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'll go look.
 
              ALICE's face registers the new terror.
 
                                  ALICE
                      They'll kill you!  Don't leave me!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES smiles warmly.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'm not afraid.
 
              ALICE waits by the couch as MRS. VOORHEES crosses the room to
              the back window.
 
                                  ALICE
                      All dead?  Neddy?  Oh, Marcie...

              ALICE stands close to the fireplace.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES reaches the window and looks out.  BRENDA's body
              sways just out of reach.  MRS. VOORHEES is shocked.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      Oh, my lord...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES turns back and, as she passes the ping-pong table,
              she picks up the lantern.
 
              ALICE waits at the fireplace.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      So young, so pretty.  What monster could
                      have done such a thing?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill--Bill--Bill is out there...
 
              She lets MRS. VOORHEES take her in her arms.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      We shall go straight to the police.
 
              ALICE backs up.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The killer is still out there.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I will protect you.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks around the room.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Oh, this place... It should never have
                      been a camp.  Not for children.  They
                      had so much trouble here.
 
              The fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace.  A log burns
              through and rolls off, throwing up a small shower of sparks.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Camp Blood.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has almost completely calmed the girl down.
              Strokes her soft hair.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      You know a boy drowned the year before
                      those two others were killed?  An
                      accident?  It was inadequate supervision.
                      The counsellors were not paying enough
                      attention... They were making love when
                      that boy drowned.
 
              ALICE looks up as the WOMAN strokes her hair.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MCU as the OLDER WOMAN's hand strokes the
              YOUNGER WOMAN's hair.  The hand is missing its little finger!
 
              The THEME enters upon the TRACK in a lyrical, child-like
              version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      We should go now.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head gently.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No.  That won't be necessary.
 
              As she speaks, MRS. VOORHEES reaches into her slicker in a
              surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting
              knife.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't understand.
 
              MIXED on the TRACK, filtered, echoed and distant, is the SOUND
              of a ten year old boy, JASON, crying for help in a fantasy
              version of what might have happened when he drowned in 1957.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                            (filtered)
                      Help me, mommy... save me... please,
                      mommy... please, mommy... help me, mommy...
                      save me....
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (cocking her hand to listen)
                      I am, Jason.  I am.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (a little confused)
                      Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy?

              MRS. VOORHEES has gone through some subtle changes.  While her
              voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip
              into her other manifestation.  All of this is in concert with
              the visibility of her weapon.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It was my son they killed.  They said he
                      drowned, but I know it was inadequate
                      supervision...
 
              ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious.  She can't see the
              knife rise behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Mr. Christy will be back soon.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head from side to side.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No, he won't.  I killed him as well....
 
              The shock of recognition hits ALICE.  In CU her eyes look up
              and see the knife which MRS. VOORHEES now has poised and ready
              to strike.
 
              ALICE bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the
              fireplace, scattering ashes and sparks.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES stands and steps forward.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      I couldn't let them start this camp
                      again, could I?
 
              ALICE, in panic, looks for an escape.  She grabs the fireplace
              poker.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I won't let you!
 
              ALICE swings the poker back and forth.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      No!  No!  No!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES raises her arm to slash downward with the knife.
              ALICE swings the poker hard to MRS. VOORHEES' other arm and rib
              cage.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is in pain, her face a mask of rage.
 
              ALICE drops the poker to run for the door.

              MRS. VOORHEES hesitates for a moment, then follows ALICE
              deliberately.
 
              Lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       123    EXT. MAIN CABIN/TREE - NIGHT
 
              ALICE gets to the door and stops.  She fiddles with the side of
              the screen... somebody has latched it.
 
              CLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at
              the door, snapping the latch.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the
              thunder and the lightning.  The THEME is going full-tilt as
              ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.
 
              TWO-SHOT:  as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from
              above.  A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of
              STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.  A rope is looped under
              his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade
              protrudes from his heart.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE in terror.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair
              of legs which swing from the same big tree.
 
              STROBE SHOT:  of JACK, dead.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.  In the BG we
              see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the distance
              between herself and ALICE.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       124    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE runs for the door, slams through it.
 
              The CAMERA waits for MRS. VOORHEES, but she does not appear.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       125    EXT. GENERATOR SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES runs to the door and opens it quickly.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       126    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE is hiding in the shadows behind a table.  We hear the
              SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three
              bright overhead lights come on.
 
              ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to
              reveal her hiding place.
 
              She looks for an escape.  There's a window.  She starts for it,
              then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few
              feet.
 
              She carries a machete in her hand.  We see this instrument in
              CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Help, mommy, I'm drowning!  Oh, mommy,
                      please....
 
              The CAMERA PANS UP to her face and we see that the voice of
              JASON is coming from within her in LIP SYNC.  She is both
              characters--though the child's voice is authentically dubbed.
 
              ALICE can just make out what is happening and can hear the
              VOICE OF JASON.
 
              ALICE is very still.  Her eyes widen as she listens to MRS.
              VOORHEES rave.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Don't let me die, mommy... I can't
                      breathe... Help me, breathe...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is having trouble catching her own breath.  She
              strokes her throat with her free hand and the voice of the
              child stops.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (in her own voice)
                      I can't let them kill any more children.
                      Come out now.
 
              She wades through table after table, pushing them out of her
              way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the
              PROWLER.
 
              When MRS. VOORHEES is too quick for her, shoving a table across
              her path like a barred door.  Before ALICE can think twice,
              MRS. VOORHEES has shoved a second table in behind her so that
              now ALICE is sandwiched between them.

              She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end--
              the end where MRS. VOORHEES is standing.
 
              ALICE looks behind her and sees a shelf.  On the shelf is a box.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables.
              Her machete is coming up in an attack.
 
              ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of
              leather-working tools.  She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard
              as she can.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning
              knives.  One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low
              animal bellow.
 
              ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shoves the tables over and hurries after her.
 
              ALICE gets to the door, shuts off the light switch and runs out.
 
              We can hear JASON'S VOICE.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       127    EXT. CAMP GROUNDS/EQUIP. SHED - NIGHT
 
              The central area is bathed in light.  The rain has stopped.
              MRS. VOORHEES has turned on all the flood-lights.
 
              ALICE runs to the corner of one of the cabins.  She stops to
              look back.  MRS. VOORHEES is gaining on her.
 
              ALICE runs to the equipment shed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  The door is thrown back.  ALICE goes in.  Looks
              for a weapon.  Nothing is available.  ALICE sobs with fear.
              She runs.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES passes the equipment shed.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       128    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              A single bulb outside the building shows ALICE as she bursts
              through the door.

       129    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              It is a small cabin.  On the walls are five .22 calibre rifles.
 
              ALICE runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles
              from the wall.
 
              She rummages in a drawer.  It's empty.  She tries another.
              Empty.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Where are the goddamned bullets?
 
              The next drawer has a lock and hasp on it.
 
              ALICE looks around.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       130    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is on her way, charging through the night.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       131    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She whacks the hasp with the butt of the
              rifle.  The hasp doesn't give.  She gives it another butt
              stroke.  It won't give.  A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She
              turns.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway,
              blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES
              steps slowly toward ALICE.
 
              ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only
              thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and,
              swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the
              arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and
              drops to the floor.

              ALICE runs out the door.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       132    EXT. MAIN CABIN FRONT - NIGHT
 
              ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the
              front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is
              no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.  She turns off the lights and runs
              into the kitchen.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       133    INT. KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT
 
              ALICE looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide.
              She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and
              then hides there, closing the door behind her.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       134    INT. LARDER - NIGHT
 
              There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.
              ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type
              which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.
 
              ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.
 
              As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.
              Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are
              turned on.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Please kill her, mommy... Help me,
                      please.  Kill her, mommy.
 
              There is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the
              sound of another door being slammed.
 
              ALICE relaxes again.
 
              Then there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door
              now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the
              idea.
 
              She cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are
              the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large
              skillet, some bags of flour, etc.
 
              ALICE covers her head with her arms.

              The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very
              slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand
              finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is
              almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.
 
              The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.
 
                                  JASON (O.S.)
                      Come out, come out, wherever you are...
 
              ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small
              room.
 
              Fists bang in a rage on the floor.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Please...
 
              ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
 
              The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.
 
              The silence is interrupted by a new sound:  MRS. VOORHEES has
              begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the
              door to the larder.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE... oh, my God...
 
              At first we see nothing on our side.  Then, gradually, we see
              little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's
              eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,
              anything...
 
              Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough
              to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.
              She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near
              the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach
              inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
 
              ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and
              picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises
              her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to
              come through the entrance.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the
              blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her
              head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is
              able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with
              a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls
              sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the
              floor.

              ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses
              carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,
              the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a
              small puddle of blood under her head.
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses
              slowly out of the room.

       135    EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              The moon comes out from behind a cloud.  ALICE pushes a canoe
              into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will
              permit, out in the lake to safety.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       136    EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Exhausted, ALICE puts her paddle across her lap and falls
              forward, slumped across a thwart.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       137    EXT. CAMP - DAWN
 
              The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the
              horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day.  The birds are
              up, foraging for food.
 
              As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky
              reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe
              holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the
              surface of the lake.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       138    EXT. LAKE - DAWN
 
              ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not
              changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The
              water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,
              she wakes.  She opens her eyes.
 
              The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree
              boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.

              They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe
              rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the
              lapping water.
 
              Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,
              and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.
              VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,
              barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
 
              The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE
              try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES
              is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get
              up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.
              ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle
              floating near her.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the
              waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.
              Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her
              mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!
 
              ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,
              who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.
              ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has
              to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,
              using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts
              the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for
              another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in
              throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out
              of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the
              water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands
              stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and
              under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.
 
              Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking
              for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                            (continuing)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her, mommy!
 
              ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in
              one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies
              off into the water.
 
              The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.
 
              ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to
              shore.

       139    EXT. CAMP ROAD/SIGN - MORNING
 
              ALICE walks slowly down the road away from the camp.  We hear
              the sound of a car approaching.  Now it comes into view.  It is
              a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door
              that says "State Department of Health and Safety".  There are
              two middle-aged bureaucrats inside.
 
              ALICE waves down the car, which pulls up beside her.
 
                                  1st INSPECTOR
                      Good morning, miss.

                                  ALICE
                      Help me.
 
              The CAMERA PANS BACK while the two men get out of their vehicle
              and come around to help ALICE.

       140    EXT. CAMP - MORNING
 
              LONG SHOT of the camp with the sun sparkling on the waters of
              Crystal Lake.  The canoe lies half sunken in the shallows.  One
              paddle drifts in the current.  The lake has swallowed its secret

FADE IN on MARIA (late 20s), asleep in bed. She's
              breathtakingly beautiful. Morning light fills the room.      The
              sound of wind, and rippling cloth.
          
              Maria stirs, and opens her eyes.     She stretches contentedly.
          
              Then she frowns.    Rolls over.    She's alone in the bed?
          
              No, she's not: PETER (20s) sits on the edge, his back to her.
              Two fresh, steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him.
          
                                     MARIA
                        Hey.     Are you okay?
          
              Peter doesn't turn. He slowly stands and walks forward
              towards an OPEN WINDOW.
          
              There's something strange about the way he moves -- stiffly,
              almost jerkily, straining his joints and muscles.
          
              Maria gets out of bed, concerned.
          
                                    MARIA
                        Peter?    What's the matter?
          
              He pauses at the window.    Turns his head to look back at her.
          
              His eyes are vacant.    His face is a blank.
          
              Then Peter slowly leans forward.     And falls from the window.
          
              Maria stands in shock as the sound of SCREECHING TIRES from
              outside reaches her ears. Then SCREAMS OF TERROR from below.
          
              Aghast, she finally manages to numbly walk forward, towards
              the window. We MOVE PAST her and TILT DOWN TO REVEAL --
          
              -- PETER'S BODY lies in the middle of the street.     His head
              has burst open, his body broken and twisted.
          
              ON THE PAVEMENT: a line of blood appears, moving down the
              center of the screen. As if hitting grooves we cannot see --
          
              -- the blood slowly forms the shape of two KANJI CHARACTERS.
              A translation appears over them: "The Grudge."

              A blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a
              subway tunnel. Most are Japanese. We're not in Kansas.
          
                                         Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     2.
          
          
          
               Standing in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is
          
               KAREN (20s, American). She faces upstream, looking for
               someone. The flow threatens to carry her away in a
               heartbeat. She looks fragile, intimidated by the madness.
          
                                   DOUG (O.S.)
                         Karen!
          
               She turns to see her boyfriend DOUG (20s, American)
               approaching. With a reassuring smile he takes her hand --
          
               -- and together, they force their way through the throng,
               trying to escape the flow. They're jostled and crushed by
               the crowd, and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer.
          
                                   KAREN
                         I'll never get used to this.
          
                                   DOUG
                         Maybe we should find a different
                         train station.
          
               He abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still
               holding Karen's hand. She turns, wondering what's going on.
               She sees the smile on his lips a moment before --
          
               -- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her. As if the
               crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all.
          
               It's tender and loving, and she responds... at first.   But
               then she pulls away, shy.

                         A public display of affection is
                         considered rude in Japan.
          
               There's an opening ahead into a SIDE STREET.   Doug and Karen
               deftly slip out of the traffic --
          
          
          2a                                                                 2a

               -- and walk hand-in-hand down the much quieter street, away
               from the crowded thoroughfare.
          
               Doug smiles as they pass by two JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL COUPLES,
               making out on the street corner. He turns to give Karen a
               sarcastic look --

          -- but she didn't notice the school kids. She's looking in
          the other direction, at a trickle of SMOKE wafting up over a
          nearby fence.
          
                              KAREN
                    What's that?
          
          Doug follows as she walks toward an OLD TEMPLE, nestled
          beneath a skyscraper. A collision of the ancient and modern.
          The fence surrounds a GRAVEYARD adjacent to the temple.
          
                              DOUG
                    We walk past this temple every day,
                    Karen --
          
                              KAREN
                    Yeah, but I've never seen this
                    before.
          
          A JAPANESE MAN stands before an ornate headstone, lighting a
          bundle of incense and bowing before the grave.
          
                              KAREN
                    It's a Buddhist ritual. The
                    incense smoke carries the prayers
                    to the spirits of his ancestors, to
                    help them remain at peace.
          
          CLINK. She turns as Doug, grinning, lights a cigarette with
          his Zippo, flicking it shut and pocketing it.
          
                              DOUG
                    It's amazing. You're like this
                    infinite storehouse of wisdom. Or
                    trivia. I'm not sure which.

                    It's not trivia. It's what they
                    believe. And it's far better, by
                    the way, than your little pollution
                    ritual.
          
          Doug's grin softens to a smile. He doesn't respond... but
          the way he's looking at Karen makes her curious:

                    What?
          
          He turns away for a moment, almost shyly, dropping his
          cigarette and crushing it. Finally:

          Leaning against a desk behind Reception is Karen's boss ALEX
          (40s, American). He's got a phone to his ear -- it's
          ringing. An ANSWERING MACHINE picks up in Japanese.
          
          Alex mutters and hangs up.   Then he notices --

                    Karen!
          
          She's started up a STAIRCASE in the center of the lobby.   She
          turns and comes back down, walking over to Alex.

          - a picture of an OLDER WOMAN (EMMA) is attached.

                    through most of the day. Her
                    daughter-in-law doesn't work, so
                    she'll probably be there.
          
          Karen seems unsure.   It's a big step for her.
          
                              ALEX
                    You're the one who's been bugging

          One of Alex's CO-WORKERS appears in the doorway, motioning to
          him. Alex quickly hands Karen a card:

                    forget to bring a map.

                THE WALL CHART: a color-coded diagram shows how the long
                address string is broken down into Postal Code, Prefecture,

                mother's leg.

               around a BICYCLE leaning against the wall and following the
               stepping-stone path to the front door. She knocks. No

                         Hello?   Mrs. Williams?
          
               Nothing. She tentatively steps inside, and the door closes
               behind her. It's dark and musty -- the blinds are drawn.
          
                                   KAREN
                         Is anyone here?
          
               She turns and LOCKS THE FRONT DOOR.

               Karen stands in the doorway, surveying the room.   The place
               is in a complete state of disarray.
          
               A SCRAPING sound grabs Karen's attention.
          
               HER POV: at the far end of the room, a FROSTED-GLASS PANELED
               DOOR leads to an adjacent room.
          
               A HAND is visible on the other side, clawing at the glass.
          
               Karen runs over and slides open the door, revealing --

               EMMA (60s, American). The older woman in the picture from
               Karen's file. She's lying on her stomach on a stained
               mattress, feebly looking up at Karen.
          
                                   KAREN
                         Oh my God... are you alright? --
          
               Karen immediately kneels down next to the infirm woman,
               helping her sit up. Emma looks dazed and disoriented.
          
               Karen's eyes sweep the room.   It reeks of neglect.

               Emma sits on the back porch, staring vacantly. But her
               expression isn't simply blank - there's an odd sadness there.

                         Okay, Emma. Let's try again: my
                         name is Karen. Do you remember?
                         I'm from the Health Center. I'm
                         substituting for Yoko, just for
                         today.
          
               Emma doesn't respond -- and there's no indication that she
               remembers Karen introducing herself before.
          
               Kneeling in front of Emma, Karen notices a BAND-AID around
               one of her fingers. Blood has soaked through it.
          
                                   KAREN
                         Looks like you need a new Band-Aid.
                         How'd this happen, Emma?
                             (still no reaction)
                         Would you like a bath? Maybe that
                         will help you feel better.
          
               Emma doesn't even turn towards her.

               Karen supports Emma's weight as she leads the old woman
               slowly down the hallway to the bathroom entrance --
          
               -- Emma stops at the doorway.    Eyes fixed on THE TUB.

                         It's okay, Emma.
          
               She takes Emma's hand and walks inside. But Emma doesn't
               budge. Her free hand TIGHTLY CLUTCHES the door frame.
          
               Her eyes are wide.   Staring at the bathtub.

               With Emma back in bed, Karen steps out of the back room and
               slides the door shut. Leans against it for a moment. A
               tough first day on the job.

               Karen has straightened up the room, and is vacuuming the
               floor. Something under the couch catches in the vacuum
               intake, jamming it.
          
               She turns off the vacuum and feels underneath, pulling out A
               CRUMPLED PHOTO -- ripped into pieces, compressed in a ball.

               Karen sits at the kitchen table, flattening and taping
               together the pieces of the photograph. She finishes.
          
               ON THE PHOTO: a grinning JAPANESE BOY holds a cute BLACK
               CAT. His MOTHER and FATHER stand beside him. They're all
               beaming at the camera -- a perfect, happy family.
          
               But there's a piece missing.   The MOTHER'S FACE.
          
               Karen walks back into the Living Room. She looks underneath
               the couch for the missing piece. Can't see anything.
          
               She lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling
               around. Nothing.
          
               Karen sticks her arm in deeper, to the shoulder, straining...
          
               She suddenly jerks her arm back, wincing.   She has a small
               cut on her finger.
          
               Karen looks under the couch for what cut her --
          
               -- a small FURNITURE NAIL sticks out underneath.

               looks up at A RAILING overhead. Some trash is visible
               sticking over the edge. Karen shakes her head:
          
                                   KAREN
                         How did you get up there?

               She gathers up the vacuum and heads up to the SECOND FLOOR
               HALLWAY. There's a nearby door, closed (the FRONT ROOM), and
               an open door at the end (the REAR ROOM).
          
               As she looks for an outlet, she hears a SCRATCHING SOUND.
          
               Karen stands there for a moment, listening.    Silence.
          
               Then she walks towards the open door at the end of the hall.

               Karen steps inside. MOVING BOXES are stacked against the
               wall, next to a desk. It's an unfinished room.
          
               She listens.   No scratching.   Nothing unusual here.   Except --
          
               Karen notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty
               shelf. It's a BLACK CERAMIC CAT. Facing the wall. Strange.
          
               And then Karen hears the SCRATCHING SOUND again.

               Karen steps into the hallway and listens.   There it is again,
               and this time there's no doubt --
          
               The sounds are coming from the room by the stairs.
          
               Karen walks to the door. She pauses, disturbed by the eerie
               sounds from inside. Then she reaches for the doorknob.
          
               THUD. THUD. Karen hesitates. The strange rhythmic THUDDING
               continues, coming from beyond the door.
          
                                   KAREN

               Karen takes a breath.   And turns the doorknob.

               The sounds immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER
               BEDROOM. It's dark, thick blinds covering the windows. A
               frosted window, overlooking the foyer, isn't helping much.
          
               She stands there for a moment, listening.   Silence.
          
               Then --

               SCRATCH SCRATCH. Startled, she gasps and turns towards THE
               CLOSED CLOSET DOORS. That's where the sound is coming from.
          
               And then she notices something strange about the closet door:
          
               It's been sealed shut with duct tape.
          
               The SCRATCHING quickens, as if sensing a presence nearby.
          
               And then there's a muffled MEOW.   There's a cat in there?
          
               Karen pulls off the duct tape. She reaches for the door
               handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside --
          
               The closet seems empty, except for a large BOOK on a shelf.
               Karen reaches inside and picks it up.
          
               Then she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a
               SMALL BLACK CAT. It's sitting on something, watching her.
          
               Karen slides the door the rest of the way open --
          
               -- revealing A YOUNG JAPANESE BOY (age 7) sitting in the
               corner, staring at Karen. The cat is curled up on his lap.
          
               Startled, Karen drops the book and falls backwards.

                         Yes, he was shut in a closet!
                         There was tape around the -- No,
                         they're not home yet. I don't
                         know, Emma hasn't said a word to me
                         -- He's still upstairs -- yes, I'm
                         sure he's Japanese -- But -- Yes,

                         here as soon as you can.
          
               Karen hangs up, putting the phone down on the kitchen table.
               She leans against the counter, exasperated.
          
               Then her attention turns to THE BOOK she found in the closet.
          
               Karen can't resist.   She opens it.
          
               THE BOOK is a large journal, filled with elegant Japanese
               writing. Karen flips through it, stopping on --

               Karen walks to the front door, reaching out to unlock it --
          
               -- but she pauses, realizing something.
          
               She reaches into her pocket, pulling out THE PHOTO she found.
               It only takes a second to verify --
          
               -- THE BOY in the photo is the one she found in the closet.
          
               Karen lowers the photo, bewildered.    Then she looks up,
               startled by --
          
               THE BOY. He's kneeling on the second floor landing above,
               watching her through the bars of the metal railing. Creepy.
          
               Karen takes a step forward, forcing a smile.

               INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
               Karen enters the room as the ANSWERING MACHINE picks up, the
               voices of a happy couple on the GREETING (in English):
          
                                   MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE)
                         "Konnichiwa! Matt and Jennifer
                         aren't around, leave a message."
          
                                   SUSAN (ON MACHINE)
                         "Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are
                         you there? Pick up...
                                   (MORE)
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       14.
          
                                    SUSAN (ON MACHINE) (cont'd)
                          Okay, well, I'm leaving work now so
                          you can try my cell, or just call
                          me at home later."
          
               The caller pauses. Karen steps closer to the phone base,
               curious, listening:
          
                                    SUSAN (ON MACHINE)
                          "I just wanted to make sure Mom is
                          okay. Yesterday was... a bit
                          weird, and -- I'm just a little
                          worried."
          
               Karen, reluctant but realizing she should pick up, reaches
               for the phone...
          
               ...but the PHONE BASE is empty.   The cordless is missing.
          
               As Karen tries to figure out how to answer with the base:
          
                                    SUSAN (ON MACHINE)
                          "Listen, just give me a call when
                          you can, okay?"
          
               CLICK.   Too late -- the caller hangs up.
          
               Silence returns to the room... but not completely.     Karen
               hears the soft sound of WHISPERING from nearby.
          
               Beyond her, we see a PALE FACE (KAYAKO) pressed against the
               frosted window of the sliding door of the TATAMI ROOM.
          
               The face pulls away from the glass just before Karen turns
               towards it. But the sound of WHISPERING continues.
          
               As she slowly walks to the door, we can make out some words:
          
                                    EMMA (O.S.)
                          ...I've told them over and over...
                          I've told them over and over...
          
               Karen listens for a moment, then slides the door open.
          
          23   INT. THE HOUSE - TATAMI ROOM - NIGHT                           23
          
               It's very dark in the room -- the lights have been turned
               off. Emma, sitting up in bed, turns towards Karen.
          
                                    KAREN
                          Emma, who were you talking to?
          
                                       Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        15.
          
          
          
               That's when Karen notices THE INDENTATION in the mattress,
               across from where Emma is sitting. Where someone else would
               be, if the old woman was having a conversation.
          
               Emma looks up at Karen with pleading eyes.
          
                                   EMMA
                         I just want her to leave me alone.
          
               Karen sits down next to her.
          
                                   KAREN
                         You should get some rest, Emma.
          
               She helps Emma lie back --
          
               -- but as the old woman's eyes move to the ceiling, they
               suddenly grow wide, her mouth opening in fear --
          
               -- Karen follows her gaze, looking up --
          
               -- and she SCREAMS, falling off the mattress, backing away --
          
               A MURKY BLACKNESS is lowering from the ceiling. Formless at
               first, but flowing and shifting... like a FIGURE draped with
               black silk. Drifting down until the shadowy "head" is only
               inches from Emma's terrified face.
          
               And then the "head" slowly turns, rotating towards Karen.
          
               In the midst of the blackness are TWO DISEMBODIED EYES.
               Filled with an intense rage. Focused directly on Karen.
          
               Off Karen's NERVE-SHATTERING SCREAM, we...
          
                                                              CUT TO BLACK.

               INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
               MATTHEW and his wife JENNIFER are in bed. He sleeps soundly,
               she doesn't. She's staring at the ceiling, listening to --
          
               -- SOUNDS coming in through the open bedroom door. Someone
               moving downstairs, fumbling around, bumping into things.
          
               Jennifer, frustrated, lets out a sigh.
          
          
               INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - MORNING

               Matthew comes downstairs, dressed in a business suit.    He
               pauses to pick up some of the RUBBISH on the stairs.

               Jennifer watches the last drops of coffee fall into the pot.
               She pours herself a mug, takes a big sip. Looks exhausted.
          
               Matthew enters, surprised to see her.
          
                                       MATTHEW
                          You're up?
          
                                       JENNIFER
                          Mmmmmm.
          
               Matthew glances into the back room through another sliding
               door -- the windows on this one are clear, not frosted like
               the living room.
          
               HIS POV:   Emma is asleep on her mattress.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          I wonder if Mom's okay. She's been
                          sleeping ever since we got here.
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          Not at night.
          
               Matthew turns to her, surprised.
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          I told you, Matthew, you can sleep
                          through anything.
          
               Matthew comes over, kisses her.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          I'm sorry, sweetheart. It was
                          probably just the move -- I'm sure
                          she'll get back on schedule.
          
               Jennifer nods, not convinced.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          You seen my travel mug?
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          I didn't unpack it yet.
          
               Matthew kneels down next to a pair of MOVING BOXES in the
               corner -- `KITCHEN' written on the side. He explores it.

                              MATTHEW
                    Maybe you should say something to
                    the helper, what's her name?
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Yoko.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Who knows? Maybe there's something
                    she can suggest.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Yeah.     Maybe.
          
          He finds his travel mug, wrapped in the sports section of an
          American newspaper. Matthew scans it as he fills his mug.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    I miss seeing this every morning.
          No response from his wife. He turns to see Jennifer looking
          down at Emma through the window.
          
          Matthew walks over, puts an arm around her.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Hey, kiddo. You okay?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I went for a walk yesterday. Just
                    to explore. I got lost and
                    couldn't find anyone who could
                    speak English, who could help me.
                    I felt so... stupid.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    This will get easier soon, for Mom,
                    for all of us. I promise.
          
          She turns to him.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Or else?
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Or else I'll tell the company it's
                    just not working out, and that
                    we're going back to the States with
                    or without my old job. They can
                    get someone else to crunch their
                    numbers.
          
          This makes Jennifer feel better.

                         give it a good try, okay Jen?
          
                                    JENNIFER

               The door opens and Matthew walks outside, stopping to look at
               a familiar BICYCLE, leaning against the house near the door.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Is this Yoko's bike?
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         I think so.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         It's been here all night.
          
               Matthew rolls the bike from the porch to the gate, leaning it
               against the wall (where we saw it earlier).
          
               He turns back to Jennifer, giving her a kiss.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         I'll probably be home late, maybe
                         around nine or so.
          
               Jennifer gives him a look.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         I knew you'd forget.
          
               Matthew pauses, looks back blankly.    Jennifer just smiles.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         Dinner, your sister?    At seven?
          
                                    MATTHEW
                         Oh yeah.   Right.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         You were going to cook.
                                   MATTHEW
                         I have a big conference.    They
                         usually run long.
          
               Jennifer rolls her eyes.

                         if you're going to be late.
          
               She goes back inside, closes the door.

               Jennifer stands by a cart, looking pale under the stark
               fluorescent lighting. She also looks shell-shocked.
          
               HER POV: before her is a WALL OF JAPANESE PRODUCTS. Barely
               a lick of English on any of the brightly-colored packages.
          
               Jennifer is, in a word, clueless. She looks around for
               assistance -- but she's lost in a whirl of Japanese faces.
          
               She tentatively reaches towards a bowl-shaped package.
               Studies the Japanese writing.
          
               Stealing a glance around her, she quietly tears open a corner
               of the bowl. Peeks inside. Sniffs it. She smiles.

               CLOSE ON the same package, a microwaveable soup bowl, now
               open with a spoon sticking out of it. Resting, with a glass
               of water, atop the kotatsu table.
          
               PAN TO REVEAL a pair of feet on the lip of a MOVING BOX next
               to the table. It's Jennifer, asleep on the couch.
          
               A CLATTERING sound wakes her, followed by the sound of
               FOOTSTEPS running away. We PULL BACK as Jennifer sees her
               bowl, and the glass next to it, have been knocked over.
          
               She sits up, looking into the TATAMI ROOM. Emma sits on the
               edge of her mattress, staring blankly at her.
          
               Jennifer gets up, sternly walks over.

                         to do is say so --
          
               She stops short as she sees...
          
               FOOTPRINTS. Formed from the broth, and noodles, of her
               spilled soup. They're the footprints of a child.
          
               And they lead away from the back room, down the main hallway.

               Jennifer follows the DAMP FOOTPRINTS. They're getting
               lighter, and cease altogether in the foyer.
          
               She stands there for a moment, bewildered. Then she tenses,
               as if sensing she's being watched. She slowly turns to see --
          
               -- A BLACK CAT. Sitting on the first landing of the stairs.
               Staring at her with bright yellow eyes.
          
               As Jennifer takes a step towards it --
          
               TWO CHILD'S HANDS reach around the corner, and pick up the
               cat, pulling it out of view.
          
               Jennifer freezes.
          
                                    JENNIFER
                          Who's -- who's there?
          
               No response. She walks up the stairs and looks around the
               corner. Nothing there.
          
               She takes a deep breath, and starts to climb.

               Reaching the top, Jennifer catches a glimpse of a familiar
               BOY running into the FRONT ROOM.
          
               She slowly walks towards the open door -- we can't see inside
               the room from the hallway. But she pauses as she hears --
          
               THUD.   THUD.   The same rhythmic thumping that Karen heard.
          
               After a moment, Jennifer steps inside the room, disappearing
               from our sight.
          
               We hear her suddenly draw a GASP.
          
               A beat. As we DRIFT CLOSER to the doorway, we notice
               something strange: the room appears to be growing darker.
               A SHARP BREATHING can be heard from inside... quick, panicked
               gulps of air. Growing faster.
          
               Just as we reach the doorway, the harsh breathing stops.

               Matthew enters from work, jacket slung over his shoulder.
          
                                      MATTHEW
                                (calling out)
                            Sorry I'm late, it took awhile to
                            wrap things up.
          
               He leaves his briefcase by the door and turns to the hall --
          
               -- noticing the house is completely DARK.
          
                                       MATTHEW

               Matthew turns on the lights. The room has reverted to its
               messy state, even worse than before.
          
               He looks down at A PICTURE, formerly hanging on the wall, now
               lying on the ground. The glass is broken.
          
                                      MATTHEW
                            What the hell? --
          
               He quickly goes to the BACK ROOM. Emma sits on the edge of
               her bed, dazed and staring. In the darkness.
          
                                       MATTHEW
                            Mom?   Are you alright?
          
               No answer.    He kneels down next to her.
          
                                      MATTHEW
                            Where's Jennifer, Mom?
          
               Still nothing.      He surveys the mess in the room.   Angrily:
          
                                      MATTHEW
                            Did Yoko come today, Mom?
                            Remember? The pretty girl?
          
               He gets to his feet, looking at the SPILLED SOUP in the
               living room, now hardened and crusty.

               Matthew stands in the doorway of the dark room.   He tries the
               light switch. Nothing happens.
          
                                     MATTHEW
                         Dammit.
          
               He slowly enters, feeling his way through the room. We can
               barely make him out in the darkness... we see the shape of
               THE BED by a window...
          
               Matthew feels his way to a table next to the bed.   Switches
               on a small lamp --
          
               -- JENNIFER IS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. Lying in bed, staring wide-
               eyed at the ceiling. Matthew, startled, falls backwards.
          
                                     MATTHEW
                         Jennifer?    What is it --
          
               Matthew rushes to her, shaking her. She's unresponsive. The
               only sign she's alive is that HER FEARFUL EYES slowly fix on
               him. Her mouth opens, as if she's trying to speak.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         What's wrong? What happened???
          
               She tries harder to form words, but can only produce a CROAK.
          
                                   MATTHEW

               Matthew runs into the kitchen grabbing A LARGE BOOK on one of
               the moving boxes. The Japanese equivalent of a YELLOW PAGES.
          
               He whips it open -- hardly a word of English in it.

               A stack of BOOKS sit on the very top of a tall bookshelf.
               Scissors and a roll of DUCT TAPE rest atop them.
          
               Matthew pushes everything aside to get at a JAPANESE/ENGLISH
               DICTIONARY underneath. The DUCT TAPE falls to the floor.
          
               He tears across the room to THE PHONE BASE -- but the
               cordless phone is missing.
          
                                   MATTHEW

               Matthew re-enters, out of breath. He sits next to Jennifer,
               who hasn't moved. Puts a hand on her chest to make sure
               she's still breathing. She is.

                         Jesus Christ...
          
               He looks through the dictionary, finding the word he needs:

                         `Ambulance'... "kyukyusha".
          
               Then he quickly rips open the Yellow Pages --
          
               -- seeing, in plain English, `EMERGENCY' on the first page.
               Below that: `FIRE/AMBULANCE -- DIAL 119'.
          
               He drops the book and reaches across the bed for a phone, on
               a table at the far side --
          
               -- THE BOY (TOSHIO) stands up, between Matthew and the phone.
          
               But he looks different from before: his skin is discolored,
               his lips and eyes are ringed and sullen.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Who are you? What -- what are you
                         doing here?
          
               Toshio makes a STRANGE SOUND. Looks at Jennifer, then turns
               to Matthew, SNARLING at him like a CAT.
          
               Matthew, shocked, falls backwards off the bed, hitting the
               table with the lamp. It drops to the ground --

               -- and TOSHIO'S SHADOW, cast by the fallen light, begins to
               STRETCH AND GROW across the ceiling. The shadow creeps over
               Jennifer, shifting and coming towards Matthew --
          
               -- Matthew grabs the lamp.    He reaches it, holding it up --
          
               At first, it looks like both Jennifer and Toshio have
               disappeared. But then --
          
               -- Jennifer, suddenly back on the bed, SITS UPRIGHT, jerkily,
               as if she's been yanked up and forward. Her mouth is wide
               and gasping --
          
               -- and then she falls back onto the bed.     Dead.
          
               Matthew, stunned, backs away from the bed, against the
               closet. Terrified, he doesn't notice --
          
               -- the THUD THUD sound growing around him.     Then --
          
               -- TOSHIO'S HEAD comes into frame behind him. Matthew hears
               a GROWLING SOUND and turns, seeing Toshio right there! --

                         I guess I came at a bad time, huh?
          
          
          41   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                            41
          
               Twisting a corkscrew into a wine bottle, Susan leans into the
               foyer, yelling upstairs:
          
                                   SUSAN
                         I'll give you guys one minute to
                         finish whatever you're doing up
                         there and get your butts down here.
          
               As she heads back towards the kitchen, we CRANE UP to see --
          
               MATTHEW. He's walking down the second floor hall. He looks
               different: the expression on his face is troubled, occupied.
          
               And he's dragging his dead wife's body.   By the hair.
          
               He pulls her inside the REAR ROOM -- the doorway looks more
               imposing, more ominous, than before. It's dark and
               malevolent, the threshold to a secret that won't stay buried.
          
               We CRANE BACK DOWN to see Susan in the kitchen.   She's poured
               a glass of wine and sighs impatiently.
          
               She walks back down the hall into the foyer.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         I mean it, guys.
          
               Silence from upstairs.   Shaking her head:
          
                                   SUSAN
                         Well, I warned you. Prepare to be
                         emotionally scarred.
          
               She starts up the stairs and turns the first corner --
          
               -- MATTHEW is sitting there, hands on his knees, looking
               harried. Susan YELPS.
          
                                    SUSAN
                         Matthew!   Don't scare me like that!
          
               He's shaking slightly.   His eyes drift up to hers.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         What's going on?   Where's Jennifer?

                              MATTHEW
                    She went out. Something came up.
          
                              SUSAN
                    I hope she's not long.    I'm
                    absolutely starving.
          
          Matthew looks back down at his feet.      Susan misreads:
          
                              SUSAN
                    I knew it. You guys forgot to go
                    shopping, didn't you?
          
          Matthew abruptly stands.    Looming over his sister.
          
                                 MATTHEW
                    I'm sorry.     This is a bad time.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Are you okay? What's going on?
          
                              MATTHEW
                    You should go.
          
          He moves forward, right into her. His momentum pushes Susan
          back into the foyer. She holds onto his shirt:
          
                              SUSAN
                    Did something happen?    What's --
          
          Matthew's hands suddenly TIGHTEN ON HER SHOULDERS. His eyes
          grow wide, filled with anger, as he whispers fiercely --
          
                              MATTHEW
                    She doesn't love me... she never
                    loved me...
          
          Susan watches as he repeats himself, over and over.      Growing
          scared, she finally SHAKES HIM.
          
                              SUSAN
                    What are you talking about?
          
          Matthew slowly looks up.    Malice on his face.
          
          He steps forward.   Susan backs away.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Stop it, Matthew.
          
                              MATTHEW
                    Leave me alone.

                                    MATTHEW
                             (yelling)
                         GO AWAY!!!
          
               Susan fumbles with the front door. She gets it open and runs
               out just before Matthew reaches her.
          
               ON MATTHEW: he stands there, head tilted down, for a moment.
               Then he straightens. Slowly closes the front door.
          
               Matthew heads back upstairs. He reaches the second floor and
               opens the door to the rear bedroom.
          
               The room beyond is dark. But A DARK FIGURE is visible,
               standing in the far corner, facing Matthew.
          
               He steps inside, and the door slowly swings shut behind him.

               EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
               It's an overcast afternoon.  Swollen clouds hang low over
               The House. It looks a bit more imposing than usual.
          
               THE MAILBOX is adorned with the Japanese equivalent of a "For
               Sale" sign -- weather-worn, and looks like it's been there
               for years.
          
               SUZUKI (30s, Japanese), a Real Estate agent, waits by the
               gate. Then he notices something. Waves, and smiles.
          
               It's SUSAN, approaching with MATTHEW, JENNIFER and EMMA.
          
               Susan shakes Suzuki's hand and they exchange a greeting in
               Japanese. She turns to her brother.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         This is Suzuki-san, he's the Real
                         Estate broker.
          
               Suzuki bows at Matthew and Jennifer, says something.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         What did he say?
          
                                   SUSAN
                         He said: "welcome to Tokyo". And
                         that you must be very important to
                         your company for them to rent this
                         place for you.

               Matthew grins.   Susan rolls her eyes.
          
          
          43   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY                               43
          
               Everyone enters, checking the place out. Suzuki and Susan
               slip off their shoes. As Matthew steps into the foyer:
          
                                   SUSAN
                         Your shoes.
          
                                     MATTHEW
                         Oh.    Right.
          
               He kneels down, untying his shoes.   Jennifer looks perplexed.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                         Even in our own house?
          
                                   SUSAN
                         Even in your own house.
          
               Suzuki smiles as Matthew and Jennifer take off their shoes.
               Susan says something to him in Japanese and he laughs. They
               walk down the hall, and Matthew and Jennifer follow.

               INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
               Suzuki opens the blinds, letting some light into the place.
               It's not helping much -- it's still pretty dreary.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Isn't the layout great? Wait `till
                         you see the back room. It's
                         perfect for Mom -- she won't have
                         to deal with the stairs.
          
               Jennifer follows him through the room.   She doesn't look
               quite as enthusiastic.
          
               Matthew slides open the door leading to the TATAMI ROOM.
          
                                   MATTHEW
                         Her bed won't be here until next
                         week, but we can put the mattress
                         on the floor. What do you think?
          
               Jennifer warms a bit.   The wooden room is beautiful.
          
               Susan asks Suzuki a question in Japanese, and he responds.

                          He says no one has lived in this
                          house for three years.
          
                                     JENNIFER
                          Why?
          
                Susan asks Suzuki in Japanese.    He shrugs.
          
                                    SUZUKI
                              (trying his English:)
                          Ex-pen-sive.
          
                Matthew suddenly realizes:
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          Where's Mom?
          
                We slowly CRANE UP to the SECOND FLOOR HALL, moving towards
                the REAR ROOM at the end. The door is ajar.

                INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
                Susan comes up the stairs, worried.
          
                                     SUSAN
                          Mom?   Where are you?
          
          
          44b   INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY                        44b
          
                Susan looks inside -- Emma isn't there. She's about to leave
                when something catches her attention. She walks to
          
                THE CLOSET. The door is open. Susan kneels down, looking at
                something inside it. She picks it up --
          
                -- it's the CERAMIC CAT Karen found earlier. As Susan
                examines it, she notices something on the wall of the closet
                (which we don't see). Her face softens, and she smiles.
          
                                    MATTHEW (O.S.)
                          Did you get her?
          
                                    SUSAN
                              (under her breath:)
                          Take a pill, will ya?
          
                Susan stands and walks out of the room. But we stay in the
                closet, PANNING TO REVEAL the closet wall. It's covered with
                BLACK CRAYON, low to the ground, the work of a child. The
                images are dozens of BLACK CATS.

               Emma stands in the dead center of the empty bedroom.
          
               Looking directly up at the ceiling.
          
               Susan enters, placing the ceramic cat on THE SHELF where
               Karen found it earlier. Except Susan faces it INTO THE ROOM.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         C'mon, Mom. You know what the
                         doctor said about stairs.
          
               She takes Emma's hand, but the old woman doesn't move.
          
               Matthew and Jennifer enter, worried.
          
                                     MATTHEW
                         She okay?

                         Mom?   What is it?
          
               Everyone follows her gaze to the ceiling.   Only Emma has the
               unmistakable look of dread on her face.
          
               A long beat.

               Suzuki walks from the kitchen into the hallway, giving the

               He pauses by the open bathroom door.   Looks inside.

               Suzuki enters, looking at THE TUB:    filled to the brim.
          
               After a moment, Suzuki kneels down next to the bathtub.     He
               pulls the thin CHAIN connected to the rubber stopper --
          
               -- but the end of the chain comes out of the water.      Hmmm.
               It's not connected after all.
          
               Suzuki eyes the plug at the bottom of the tub.
          
               Then he takes off his jacket.   Rolls up his shirt sleeve.
          
               And reaches into the water for the rubber stopper.
          
               It's just out of reach.
          
               He rolls up his sleeve a little more.   Reaches deeper --
          
               -- suddenly there's a BURST OF SOUND: a dull THUMPING,
               something THRASHING in water, the SCREAMING of a YOUNG BOY,
               voice MUFFLED by water --
          
               -- Suzuki recoils as water SPLASHES UP around him --
          
               -- he falls away from the tub in horror, landing on his butt.
          
               THE BATHTUB: Filled to the brim.     Still and silent.    Not so
               much as a ripple on the surface.
          
               That couldn't have just been his imagination, could it?
          
               As he slowly stands, he sees something out of the corner of
               his eye --
          
               -- a DEAD CAT, bloody and torn, in the corner of the room.

                As Suzuki backs away from it, eyes widening in horror, he's
                startled by --
          
                MATTHEW, standing in the doorway.   Beaming at him.
          
                                    MATTHEW
                          It's perfect. We'll take it.
          
                Suzuki looks back to the corner.    There's no dead cat.
          
                A RINGING SOUND comes into focus -- the BEEPING of a phone,
                waiting for someone to pick up and make the connection...

                It's after-hours in this office space: CUBICLES fill the
                center, surrounded by glass-windowed OFFICES. The glittering
                lights of the Tokyo cityscape beyond show a hell of a view.
          
                One light still burns in an office towards the end --
          
                -- SUSAN'S OFFICE. She's working late. She wears a phone
                headset while she types lines of code into her computer.
          
                No one's answering.   A familiar answering machine picks up:

                          "Konnichiwa! Matt and Jennifer

                          Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are
                          you there? Pick up... Okay, well,

                She pauses.   Leans back, away from the keyboard.

                She hangs up, taking the headset off.   Concerned.

                Susan walks through the hallway. She hears a strange
                scraping sound -- it sounds as though something is being
                dragged.
          
                Susan turns around, but the hallway looks normal. Is it just
                her imagination?
          
                The sound starts again, coming closer. Susan gets scared and
                opens the door to the emergency stairwell beside her.
          
          49a                                                               49a
                INT. STAIRWELL - 10TH FLOOR - NIGHT
                The hallway is chilly -- Susan shivers. She's about to start
                walking down when she looks up, noticing THE LIGHTS at the
                top floor FLICKERING.
          
                A wind suddenly blows through the center of the stairwell
                with an eerie ROAR.
          
                Susan looks disconcerted as she starts walking down...
          
                Then we hear the SCRAPING SOUND again. Startled, Susan
                pauses and looks down, over the railing.
          
                There's nothing there -- but the sound continues, growing
                louder, like something is moving up towards her.
          
                                    SUSAN
                              (calling out:)
                          Is anybody there?
          
                Just then, the lights on the top floor finally GO OUT.
          
                Susan's breath catches in her throat as she looks up --
          
                The lights on the next floor go out. And the next. The
                darkness above growing closer with each darkening floor.
          
                Susan nervously looks back down -- the SCRAPING is even
                closer. And then, for an instant, she sees A SKINNY PALE
                HAND on the railing two floors down.
          
                Terrified, Susan starts to back up -- but stops as she
                realizes that the darkness from above is almost upon her.

                floor where she stands, and A HEAD COVERED WITH BLACK HAIR
                slowly crawling up on the wall.
          
                Susan's mouth opens in a silent screen. With nowhere to
                escape, she opens the same door and rushes back into the
                hallway --

                 -- but her lucky RABBIT'S FOOT gets caught on the door latch.
                 Panicking, Susan struggles to free herself --
          
                 Through the crack, she sees the darkness continuing to come
                 down. The lights on Susan's floor FLICKER.
          
                 Susan looks up to see A PALE BOY on the landing to the higher
                 floor. The SAME BOY is also standing on the landing of each
                 floor above. They're all staring down at Susan.
          
                 Susan screams as she desperately tries to yank her chain
                 free... and then she sees THE PALE HAND clutching her
                 rabbit's foot!
          
                 The door shuts, and Susan falls backwards into the hallway.
          
                 She jumps to her feet and runs down the hall.

                 A cramped room. Susan stands in the doorway, animatedly
                 talking to a young SECURITY GUARD sitting at a desk lined
                 with VIDEO MONITORS. She's speaking rapidly, and shaking:

                           In the stairs... there was...

                           all the lights were going out...
          
                 The Guard doesn't understand her -- in her panic, Susan's
                 MISPRONOUNCING HER WORDS, and she knows it.
          
                 Susan takes a breath, frustrated and frightened.

                Susan takes a breath and sits down, trying to relax. It's
                obvious that she feels safer, here in the Security Room.
          
                Then she notices movement on one of the SECURITY MONITORS --
          
                ON THE SCREEN: -- the GUARD continues down the 10TH FLOOR
                HALL, stopping at the door to the stairwell.
          
                Susan leans toward the monitor for a better view.
          
                ON THE SCREEN: the Guard opens the stairwell door and leans
                inside, checking it out.
          
                ON SUSAN:   her eyes are glued to the screen.   Waiting.
          
                ON THE SCREEN: the Guard, finding nothing out of the
                ordinary, closes the door and continues on down the hall.
          
                SUSAN leans back, exhaling.    Relieved.
          
                Then the video CRACKLES with a sudden quick burst of static.
          
                And Susan GASPS, sitting upright, as she sees --
          
                ON THE SCREEN:   the stairwell door OPENS AGAIN.   And then --
          
                -- something DARK moves out of the stairwell, entering the
                hallway.
          
                ON SUSAN: she recoils from the screen in horror, unable to
                tear her gaze away. Her mouth opens in a silent scream, her
                eyes widening as she watches --
          
                -- and then she finds the strength to get to her feet.

                Susan rushes out of the front doors and runs to the street.
                She frantically hails a cab and gets in.

                Susan presses herself in the corner of the back seat, purse
                clutched tightly in her white knuckles.

               A shifting wash of colors flood the taxi: the NEON LIGHTS of
               the surrounding buildings tower above, threatening to swallow
               her whole.

               Susan rushes through the front doors, clutching her purse
               strap with both hands. Shaken, just wanting to get home.
          
               She runs to the elevator and jabs the button for her floor.

               Susan tries to regain her composure as the elevator rises.
               She closes her eyes and leans against the wall --
          
               -- not noticing A FAMILIAR PALE JAPANESE BOY looking at her
               through the window of every floor she passes --
          
               Toshio. He's standing CLOSER TO THE WINDOW with each floor.
               Until finally, he's RIGHT NEXT TO THE GLASS --
          
               The elevator stops at her floor:    no little boy this time.

               Susan gets out of the elevator, moving quickly to her
               apartment at the end of the hall.
          
               She chances a look over her shoulder as she puts the key in
               her lock. Then she goes in and closes the door.

               Susan enters. She takes a long, deep breath. Safe at home.
               She sits at her kitchen table, laying her purse down.
          
               Her eyes go to the BROKEN CHAIN still hanging from the strap,
               with some rabbit's foot fur lodged in the links.
          
               Susan's home phone RINGS, and she jumps.    She stares at it
               for a moment, then tentatively answers:

               She presses a button on the phone, and is about to hang up --
          
               Almost immediately there's a LOUD KNOCK at her door. She
               gets to her feet, surprised. How did he get up so fast?
          
               Susan goes to the door and looks through the peephole.
          
               HER POV: Matthew's face, distorted by the fish-eye glass.
               He's looking into the peephole, with a sneer on his face.
          
               Susan opens the door.
          
                                   SUSAN
                         I don't know what you're up to, but
                         this is not cool --
          
               She catches her breath.   THERE'S NO ONE THERE.
          
               Then the phone emits the THROATY CROAKING sound.   Quickly
               growing louder and LOUDER...
          
               Susan cries out and drops the phone. It BREAKS OPEN on the
               hallway floor as Susan slams her apartment door.

               Susan quickly draws the chain lock. Then she builds the
               courage to step forward, and look through the peephole --
          
               HER POV: the phone lies broken in the middle of the floor.
               Otherwise, the hallway is empty.
          
               Susan backs away from the door, shaking in fright.
          
               Breathing hard, she backs into --

                Susan enters, turning off her cell phone and unplugging the
                bedroom phone from the wall.
          
                Then she retreats to the safety of her bed, eyes on --
          
                THE APARTMENT DOOR, next to the kitchen.    Silence.
          
                Susan's breathing slows. But she looks around the room,
                still anxious -- it's too quiet in here. Her panic builds.
                But she's alone in the room, isn't she?
          
                As we MOVE IN on Susan, the room starts to become quieter.
                The SOUND OF TRAFFIC from outside, the HUMMING REFRIGERATOR
                in the kitchen... everything fades to a stifling silence.
          
                And Susan notices, all right.    Her breath, now suddenly loud,
                catches in her throat.
          
                A long moment of silence.   Then --
          
                -- DRIP.   DRIP.
          
                It's coming from the KITCHEN SINK.
          
                Susan stares at it.   She finally stands, and --
          
          62a                                                                  62a

                -- slowly walks into THE KITCHEN. She reaches out and turns
                the faucet handle. Tightens it. The dripping stops.
          
                Relieved, Susan turns away --
          
                -- DRIP.   DRIP.   It begins again.   Louder, more intense.
          
                Scared, Susan turns back to the sink. Water is now GUSHING
                OUT from the faucet, filling up a bowl in the sink.
          
                She slowly reaches out a hand and turns the faucet, as
                tightly as she can manage --
          
                -- tighter... tighter... straining with the effort..
          
                Until the water stops.   Only then does she let go --
          
                -- just then, a CHILD'S PALE HAND quietly rises to the
                surface from water in the bowl, and starts VIOLENTLY
                SPLASHING the surface.

                She lies down, shivering, pulling the quilt to her chin.      A
                final retreat.
          
                                    SUSAN
                          Please... stop it...
          
                The SPLASHING SOUNDS in the kitchen continue for a while.
                Then, it suddenly stops.
          
                Susan is so terrified that she almost faints.
          
                Then her breathing stops.   Her eyes widen.
          
                Her hand reaches up under her pillow, feeling around --
          
                -- and she comes out with HER LUCKY RABBIT'S FOOT.
          
                The one she left behind in the stairwell.
          
                Susan suddenly CRIES OUT, her head tilting back, her body
                abruptly going stiff. We soon see why:
          
                A LUMP begins to rise at the foot of the bed. A big one.
                Moving slowly up Susan's body. Reaching the edge of the
                quilt, which slowly rises --
          
                -- revealing a QUICK FLASH of the PALE FACE OF THE JAPANESE
                WOMAN WITH LONG DARK HAIR on top of her!
          
                Susan SCREAMS, and is abruptly pulled under the covers --

               A new SOUND breaks the silence: movement outside. Crunching
               footsteps on gravel, someone brushing past tree limbs.
          
               A SHADOW falls over the window.   A face looks inside --
          
               -- it's ALEX, Karen's boss. He walks away from the window
               and continues down the side of the house --
          
               -- we TRACK down the hallway, past the bathroom, through the
               kitchen, following his progress into --
          
               THE BACK ROOM: Alex is visible through the sliding door
               leading to the back porch. He peers inside.
          
               HIS POV: A FIGURE covered head-to-toe in a white sheet lies
               on the mattress. Unmoving.
          
               Alex tries the sliding door -- it's open.     He steps inside.
          
                                     ALEX
                         Karen?
          
               Silence greets him.   He stares down at the figure in the bed.
          
               Alex licks his lips, nervous.   Finally walks to the mattress,
               kneeling down next to it.
          
               Raises a hand and grabs the sheet.      Raises it over the head --
          
               -- it's Emma. As we last saw her, eyes on the ceiling, mouth
               and eyes wide open in fear.
          
               But now it's clear, from the tache noire in the eyes, the
               blanched skin, the rigidity of her body: she's dead.
          
               Alex falls back onto his butt, staring at Emma.     He pulls
               himself away from the corpse --
          
               -- and freezes.    There's something right behind him.
               He whirls around --
          
               -- it's KAREN.    In the corner, looking pale and dazed.

               one. Nakagawa just stares up at The House.

               The house feels completely different: all the interior
               lights are on, a few POLICE OFFICERS mill about, two EMTs
               wheel EMMA'S BODY out the front door on a gurney.
          
               Alex sits at the kitchen table, frazzled.   He turns to --
          
               -- KAREN. She's sitting in the living room, wrapped in a
               blanket, being attended to by a FEMALE NURSE and speaking
               with Nakagawa and Igarashi, who is taking notes on a pad.
          
               Karen says something and the Detective looks over at Alex.
               Then he speaks to the Nurse, who helps Karen to her feet.
          
               Nakagawa and Igarashi enter the kitchen.    In perfect English:
          
                                   NAKAGAWA
                         I am Detective Nakagawa. This is
                         Detective Igarashi, my assistant.
          
                                   ALEX
                         Is Karen okay?

                              NAKAGAWA
                    She is very shaken. We would like
                    her to stay in the hospital
                    tonight, under evaluation.
          
          He hands Alex a wedding picture of MATTHEW AND JENNIFER.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    Do you know these people?
          
                              ALEX
                    Matthew Williams, and his wife
                    Jennifer. He's Emma's son, the
                    woman Karen came here to see.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    When was the last time you saw him?
          
                              ALEX
                    I met them when they came to
                    register. It's standard procedure,
                    though the visits were arranged by
                    his employer. He works at --

                    We've spoken with his employer.   He
                    did not show up for work today.
          
          Something about this gives Alex pause. Nakagawa speaks
          briefly to Igarashi in Japanese, then hands Alex a card.
          
                              NAKAGAWA

               -- YOKO'S BICYCLE.   He looks down at it, frowning.
          
               Then he suddenly cocks his head.    As if sensing something.
          
               He turns to look up at A WINDOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR.
          
               It's empty.

               Igarashi stands by the ANSWERING MACHINE.    The message
               counter reads `1'. He presses PLAY.
          
               SUSAN'S MESSAGE replays, and he listens carefully. As it
               ends, he turns to see NAKAGAWA standing in the doorway.
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         That's Matthew's sister.
          
               He shows Nakagawa a PHOTO of Matthew and Susan, brother and
               sister, grinning at the camera.
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)

               Nakagawa reaches down, pressing the `LOCATE' button.
          
               A distant BEEPING SOUND can be heard.
          
               Everyone in the room stops what they're doing.    They listen.

               The BEEPING is definitely coming from upstairs.

               Nakagawa and Igarashi come upstairs, their men following
               close behind.
          
               They pause in the hallway for a moment. Then Nakagawa walks
               into the rear room (Matthew's office). The BEEPING is close.
          
               He stands there, in the center of the room, listening.
          
               Then he looks up, at the ceiling.    Everyone follows suit.
          
               Nakagawa turns to the CLOSED CLOSET DOORS.

               He quickly pulls open the door.   The closet is empty.
          
               Nakagawa looks up, peering into the darkness.
          
               HIS POV:   the ATTIC PANEL yawns wide open.
          
               And right next to it are FOUR LONG GROOVES in the ceiling.
               As if something was dragged across it, right to the edge.
          
               Something like fingernails.
          
               Nakagawa leans out, looking at Igarashi.
          
                                    NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                          I need your flashlight.

               A shaft of light from the flashlight through the open attic
               access cuts through the thick darkness.
          
               Nakagawa appears, pulling himself up into the attic.     He
               swings his flashlight slowly around the room.
          
               Igarashi comes up next to Nakagawa just as the Detective's
               flashlight stops on something.
          
               A beat as they exchange an uneasy look.
          
               Then Nakagawa and Igarashi crawl through the darkness towards
               the far corner of the space.
          
               Two bodies are tucked into the corner.    MATTHEW AND JENNIFER.

               Nakagawa sees the beeping CORDLESS PHONE a few feet away.
          
               SOMETHING next to it attracts Nakagawa's interest. We can't
               see what it is, but there's some DEEP RED in it, and
               something very WHITE --

                         What is that?

               EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
               The POLICE CARS outside have attracted a small crowd.   The
               TWO BODIES are being loaded into a POLICE VAN.
          
               Nakagawa stands with THE CORONER. The CORONER'S ASSISTANT,
               wearing a face mask and rubber gloves, approaches. He holds
               something small, wrapped in a bloody white sheet.
          
               The Coroner slowly unfolds the sheet. We can't see what he's
               looking at -- but it elicits quite a reaction.
          
                                   CORONER (IN JAPANESE)

               The Coroner quickly re-covers the object.
          
                                   CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                         I can use the blood to help
                         identify the person.
          
               As the Coroner and his assistant walk away:
          
                                   NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Is it possible that someone could
                         live without... that?

                Nakagawa turns away to see Igarashi approaching, talking into
                a cell phone. He looks disturbed. As he hangs up:

                          Someone just reported another
                          death. It's not in our district...
                          but I think we should check it out.
          
                Nakagawa realizes something's troubling his partner.

                          but it is the man who sold them

                The pedals are being pumped by a beautiful young Japanese
                woman -- this is YOKO (early 20s).

                Yoko opens the gate and walks her bike to the front door,
                leaning it against the wall nearby (exactly where we saw
                Matthew bump into it earlier).
          
                She rings the door buzzer. Waits. She seems to have
                expected this: she pulls a KEY from her pocket, with a
                plastic LABEL on it.

                Yoko steps inside. She instinctively slips off her shoes.
                She calls out, in decent English:

                          Hi, excuse me?
          
                There's a small ENVELOPE with YOKO'S NAME resting on a small
                table by the door. She takes it, opens it.

          THE LETTER says, simply:   "Out for a walk, back later."

                         Emma?   It's Yoko.   I'm coming in.
          
          
          79   INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                           79
          
               The house is the least "moved-into" that we've seen so far:
               although the main furniture is in place, MOVING BOXES are
               stacked in every room, in various stages of unpacking.
          
               But there's also an unusual amount of mess in the house -- a
               disarray, much like the opening sequence, that isn't exactly
               related to moving in.
          
               Yoko surveys the room, dismayed by the mess.
          
               Then she sees EMMA at the far end of the living room, her
               back to Yoko. She's looking down at something in her hands.
          
                                     YOKO
                         Hi, Emma.    It's good to see you
                         again.
          
               Emma turns. Looks blankly at Yoko, who approaches.
               Realizing the woman doesn't remember her:
          
                                   YOKO
                         My name is Yoko.
          
               The old woman still gives no sign of recognition.   Yoko
               gently takes her arm.
          
                                   YOKO
                         You should be in bed --
          
               Then she sees what Emma was looking at: the roll of DUCT
               TAPE. She's cut her finger on the serrated cutting blade.
          
                                   YOKO (IN JAPANESE)
                         You shouldn't be playing with this!
          
               Shaking her head, Yoko takes the duct tape and looks around
               for a place where Emma can't get at it --
          
               -- she puts the tape ON THE STACK OF BOOKS at the top of the
               bookshelf, next to the scissors (where Matthew found them).

          81a   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY                              81a
          
                From the entrance, we see Yoko come out of the kitchen
                holding a tray with a teapot and cup.
          
                She walks into the BACK ROOM, looking down at Emma's bed.
                The old woman must be asleep: Yoko gently lays down the
                tray, quietly steps out of the room and slides the door shut.
          
                Then Yoko moves through the LIVING ROOM to the PHONE BASE --
          
                -- she picks up THE CORDLESS, finally where it belongs.
          
                Yoko dials a number as she walks into THE ENTRANCE HALL.     She
                begins a conversation (in Japanese) as she looks at the
                scattered rubbish on the ground, shaking her head.
          
                She climbs up to the SECOND FLOOR, pausing to kneel and pick
                up some pieces of crumpled paper, chatting all the while.
          
                THUD. THUD. Yoko pauses, turning towards the open door to
                the front room. The rhythmic THUMPING continues.

                The room is a mess. The bed is unmade, clothes are strewn on
                the floor. Looks like a storm swept through it.
          
                Yoko stands in the doorway, listening for the THUMPING
                sounds. But they've stopped.
          
                She finishes her call and hangs up. Sighs. She sticks the
                cordless phone into her pocket and starts to clean the room.
          
                As Yoko straightens the bedspread, she hears something.
                Pauses. And we hear it too --
          
                -- a familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND.   Quiet and muffled.
          
                                         Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         49.
          
          
          
                 Yoko, a bit unnerved by the strange sound, pulls a small MP3
                 player and headphones from her pocket. She puts them on, and
                 goes back to work.
          
          
          84aa   INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY                 84aa
          
                 Yoko backs into the hallway, humming along to the music.
                 Preoccupied, she doesn't notice as --
          
                 The DOOR TO THE REAR ROOM, at the end of the dark hall behind
                 her, SLOWLY SWINGS OPEN.
          
                 Yoko turns and walks down the hall towards it.
          
          
          84a    INT. THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - DAY                             84a
          
                 Yoko enters the room, which is also a mess. The MOVING BOXES
                 are tumbled about the small room. She sighs.
          
                 Then she notices the CERAMIC CAT on the shelf, FACING HER
                 (where Susan left it).   Apparently she's not a big fan of
                 felines: she uneasily turns it to FACE THE WALL instead.
          
                 Yoko turns back to the room, staring to stack the moving
                 boxes (the way we saw them before). As she does --
          
                 -- she pauses again. The music in her headphones starts
                 PHASING, digital noise creeping in...
          
                 Yoko takes off the headphones.   Stares at them.
          
                 And then there's another CROAKING SOUND.   From close by.
          
                 Yoko draws a breath, quickly looking up --
          
                 -- AT THE CEILING, directly above her.   That's where the
                 horrible sound is coming from.
          
                 Freaked out, Yoko backs away, and opens the bedroom door --
          
          85                                                                   85
                 INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
                 -- the hallway is COMPLETELY DARK. An unnatural blackness.
                 The skylights above, which were previously filled with
                 sunlight, are now completely opaque.
          
                 Yoko stands in the doorway, scared, afraid to step into the
                 darkness. Then she looks down --
          
                                      Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         49A.
          
          
          
               HER POV: the murky blackness of the hall seems to be slowly
               CREEPING IN, phantomlike, around the edges of the door.

               Yoko stumbles back into the room.   Her eyes fixed on --
          
               -- THE DOORWAY: the creeping darkness is now coming in
               around all sides, not just the bottom.
          
               Yoko backs up to the bed, still clutching the CORDLESS PHONE.
          
               She looks back at the door, suddenly CRYING OUT --
          
                                        Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         50.
          
          
          
               -- A BLACK CAT sits in the doorway. Tail wrapped around
               itself, sitting perfectly still, like a statue. Staring at
               Yoko with its yellow eyes. Something unnatural about it.
          
               Yoko backs away towards the closet.   Nowhere to go.
          
               The cat suddenly HISSES AT HER --
          
               -- and that's all Yoko can take.    In a panic, she opens the
               closet door, ducks inside.

               Yoko slams the door shut, pulling herself up onto a raised
               shelf. Breathing hard, looking down at --
          
               -- the crack under the door.   The light is beginning to dim.
          
               Yoko presses back into the closet, trapped.
          
               The closet is starting to get dark.   Quickly.
          
               Yoko looks around desperately.   Looking up, she sees --
          
               -- THE ATTIC PANEL above her is wide open.
          
               Caught between a rock and a hard place.   Yoko decides:
          
               She shakily stands on the shelf and reaches up to pull
               herself into the attic.

               Yoko's head appears. Then her shoulders.     She looks around,
               but can't see a thing in the darkness.
          
               She's about to pull herself all the way up --
          
               -- when she hears the THROATY CROAKING SOUND.
          
               Coming from the darkness.
          
               Yoko stiffens, her breath catching in her throat.
          
               ANOTHER POV: we're at the far end of the attic, suddenly and
               rapidly RACING FORWARD TOWARDS YOKO...
          
               ON YOKO:   something brushes her face.   Long, black hair.
          
               There's a head, just inches from hers.    Almost nose-to-nose.

               Then she reaches into her pocket, pulling out a LIGHTER.
          
               Yoko raises it and flicks the wheel --
          
               -- we get a glimpse of a PALE FACE, surrounded by long black
               hair, eyes wide and mouth open, the THROATY SOUND suddenly
               increasing in pitch and volume --

               Karen slowly wakes up in bed.    As her eyes clear, she sees --
          
               DOUG. He sits on the edge of the bed, slightly slumped, his
               back to her.
          
               He slowly turns -- and a relieved smile crosses his face.     He
               moves closer, and reaches out a hand.
          
                                      DOUG

               Karen nods, lacing her fingers in his. But her eyes are
               glazed and unfocused -- she's exhausted.
          
                                    DOUG

               She turns away, the memory bothering her.    Doug takes her
               hand, massaging her fingers, worried.

                    woman passed away in her sleep.
                    It's sad, but that's all it is --
          
                              KAREN
                    Is that how they said she died?
          
                              DOUG
                    I'm sorry this happened to you.
                    But maybe, in a way, it will help
                    you later. Death is an unfortunate
                    but integral part of your future
                    career. There's no avoiding it.
                    Maybe now you'll be more... ready
                    for it.
          
                              KAREN
                    I don't think I'll ever be ready
                    for something like that.
          
          She turns away. Doug wraps an arm around her.   Karen leans
          into him, and he strokes her hair.

          The moment is broken by a soft KNOCK. Detective Nakagawa
          stands in the doorway, holding a thick FILE.
          
                               NAKAGAWA
                    I'm sorry to disturb you, Miss
                    Davies. I was wondering if you
                    could answer some additional
                    questions?
          
          Doug stands, intercepting Nakagawa.   He sticks out a hand.
          
                                DOUG
                    I'm Doug.    Karen's boyfriend.
          
          Nakagawa nods. Fixes Doug with a blank stare.   Taking the
          hint, Doug turns to Karen.
          
                              DOUG
                    You up for this?
          
                              KAREN
                        (nodding:)
                    Why don't you find out when I can
                    check out of here.

          Reluctantly, Doug kisses her brow, then exits. Nakagawa
          pulls a chair up to the bed and sits, putting the file on a
          small table.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    How are you feeling?
          
                               KAREN
                    Okay.   Tired.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    You are an exchange student?
                        (Karen nods:)
                    And you have been volunteering at
                    the Health Center for...?
          
                              KAREN
                    Three months. I needed a social
                    welfare credit.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    You said this was the first time
                    you'd been in that house?
          
                               KAREN
                    Yes.
          
          She notices Nakagawa isn't taking notes. He seems somewhat
          uncomfortable, as if he's building to something:
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    About the Japanese boy you said you
                    saw there --
          
                              KAREN
                    Did you find him?
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    No, not yet. You said the boy had
                    been taped into the closet?
          
                              KAREN
                    Yes, that's right. He was...
                    holding a cat. A black cat.
                        (remembering:)
                    There was a book in the closet,
                    too. I think it was a journal.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    Did it belong to the boy?

          I don't think so. I think it
          belonged to a woman.

          Nakagawa looks up.   Karen tries to explain:
          
                              KAREN
                    The writing. It looked feminine.

                              KAREN
                    I left it on the kitchen table.
          
          Nakagawa frowns, scribbles a note.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    I didn't see any book on the table.
                    Perhaps someone moved it. Did you
                    speak with the boy after you opened
                    the closet?
          
          She thinks, recalling:
          
                              KAREN
                    I asked him his name.   He said
                    `Toshio'.
          
          Nakagawa immediately tenses. A long beat. He can see how
          exhausted Karen is. But something's troubling him:
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    One more question, please.
          
          He slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out THE PHOTO
          Karen found, and taped together. He shows it to her.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    We found this in the room where...
          
          Karen looks at the picture.
          
                              KAREN
                    This is him. This is the boy.
          
                              NAKAGAWA
                    Are you certain?
          
                               KAREN
                    Yes.   Positive.
          
          Nakagawa stares down at the picture in his hands.
          
          And Karen notices -- Nakagawa's hands are shaking.
          
                              KAREN
                    Detective Nakagawa?
          
          He looks up at her, a faraway look in his eyes.
          
                              KAREN
                    The whole time I was in that house,
                    I felt something was... wrong.

          From the expression on Nakagawa's face, she's onto something.
          
                              KAREN
                    What happened there?
          
          Nakagawa holds Karen's gaze for a moment. Even in her
          exhausted state, it's clear -- she's as frightened as he is.

                         The bodies of the son and daughter-
                         in-law of the woman you were caring
                         for were found in the attic.
          
               Karen just stares at him, stunned.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA
                         It seems that the son killed his
                         wife, and then himself --
          
               There's a KNOCK on the door. Igarashi stands in the doorway.
               He speaks to Nakagawa in Japanese.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA
                             (to Karen)
                         Please excuse me for a moment.
          
               Nakagawa puts the photo down and steps into the hallway and
               closes the door, but not all the way. Karen watches and
               listens through the crack:
          
          90                                                                90

                         We checked the apartment of Susan,
                         the sister. She wasn't there...
          
               He trails off, hesitating.
          
                                     NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Yes?
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         The chain lock had been drawn from
                         the inside. And the deadbolt. But
                         we found no one in the apartment.
          
               Nakagawa takes this in.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Get the surveillance tapes from the
                         office building.
          
               Igarashi nods.    But doesn't move.   After a moment, quietly:
          
                                   IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                         They were the first family to live
                         in that house since the incident
                         three years ago --

               Nakagawa's harsh look silences him. Then the Detective
               turns, noticing KAREN watching them. He pulls the door shut.

               Nakagawa's stern voice is muffled by the closed door.    Karen
               sits back in bed, disturbed.
          
               Then her attention turns to THE FILE on the table.
          
               She considers.   Then reaches for it.   Opens it.
          
               It's a POLICE REPORT, in Japanese.
          
               Karen scans it, and turns the page.     She draws a breath --
          
               -- it's a photo of THE HOUSE. Cordoned off with police tape.
               An ambulance out front. Like the scene she just left...
          
               ...only the picture is dated three years ago.
          
               THREE DETECTIVES are visible beyond the open front door,
               conferring in the entryway.
          
               The photo of the house is attached to a POLICE REPORT, with
               THREE PICTURES. A stern-looking Japanese man (TAKEO), a
               somber woman (KAYAKO), and a YOUNG BOY we know very well --
          
               Karen makes the connection. She picks up the taped-up photo
               and compares it to the file... the boy and his father are the
               same as in the newspaper.
          
               Karen gently touches the "missing" face of KAYAKO -- then her
               eyes move to the picture of THE BOY.
          
               Her eyes widen as she reads THE JAPANESE TEXT under his face:

               INT. NURSING CARE CENTER - NIGHT
               The place is quiet, completely deserted.    Except for --
          
               -- Alex. He's behind his desk in the reception area, staring
               off into space. Alex finally glances up at a clock -- it's
               almost ten o'clock.
          
               He gets up, turns off his computer, switches off the lights,
               and walks around the reception desk towards --
          
                                    Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     57.
          
          
          
          THE FRONT DOORS. He hits a final light switch and is almost
          to the exit, when --
          
          -- he suddenly SLIPS. Almost falls.    Saves himself by
          throwing a hand up against the wall.
          
          He looks down.    What the hell did he slip on?
          
          A pool of liquid. Right by the front doors, where the ladder
          stood earlier. It's too dark to make out what the fluid is.
          
          Alex looks down at HIS HAND -- it's covered in the liquid.
          And there's a dark HANDPRINT where he grabbed the wall.
          
          HIS POV: a trail of FOOTPRINTS lead from the pool of liquid,
          around the base of the stairs.
          
          His eyes on his dirtied hand, Alex slowly reaches for the
          nearby light switch. The overheads come on --
          
          -- the liquid is deep red.   Blood.
          
          Alex looks across the room. Shaking, he starts to walk
          forward, following the footsteps.
          
          He pauses at the bottom of the stairs, seeing --
          
          -- the BLOOD TRAIL has stopped.   Right by the bottom step.
          
          Alex looks up the staircase.   No blood.
          
          After a moment, Alex starts to walk up.    As he reaches the
          first landing --
          
          He freezes.   Sensing something behind him.   He turns to see --
          
          YOKO. Head lowered, clothing is torn and bloody. She's
          slowly climbing up the steps, but she's MOVING JERKILY, like
          a marionette, her limbs making a strange CREAKING as if
          tendons and muscles are being pushed to their limits.
          
          And there's BLOOD DRIPPING DOWN, splattering on her shoes.
          
                                ALEX
                    Yoko?
          
          She keeps moving, straining, climbing... towards him.

                          What... What happened, Yoko?
          
               Now she finally stops, two steps away.    A long beat.
          
                                    ALEX
                          Say something, please...
          
               Yoko slowly raises her head towards him --
          
               -- the lower half of her face is missing. Her jawbone has
               been ripped out, her tongue hanging limply on her chest.
          
               Alex stumbles backwards... and his foot lands right in a
               puddle of blood. His legs fly out from under him and he
               CRACKS HIS HEAD AGAINST THE GROUND.
          
               HIS POV: everything goes blurry, and canted 90 degrees.       But
               it looks like there's A FIGURE standing in the hallway,
               watching the scene...
          
               ...a small boy holding a black cat...
          
               Dazed, Alex plants a hand on the ground and pulls himself
               into a seating position --
          
               -- and coming face-to-face with YOKO, kneeling down directly
               in front of him. Her bloody tongue dripping, lolling...
          
               ON ALEX:   eyes wide, he opens his mouth to scream --
          
                                                              HARD CUT TO:

               Nakagawa sits at the desk. Exhausted, dark circles under his
               eyes, he's staring down at --
          
               THE FILE on his desk.   As if he's afraid to even open it.
          
               But he does. He flips through the photos, pausing on that of
               TOSHIO, but continuing on to THE BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of The
               House from three years ago (the one Karen saw), with the
               THREE DETECTIVES.
          
               Nakagawa turns to a FRAMED PICTURE on his desk -- it's
               YOUNGER NAKAGAWA at a bar with THREE FAMILIAR DETECTIVES.
               They're off-duty, grinning at the camera. Buddies.
          
               The two photographs share THE SAME THREE DETECTIVES.

               As Nakagawa looks at the crime scene photo, he realizes
               something. He slowly stands, in shock, trembling.
          
               The phone RINGS, startling him.
          
               Nakagawa walks over, picks up the phone.
          
                                      NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)

               He listens.
          
               His face goes blank.    He slowly lowers the phone.

               The CORONER sits on a stool, staring at the floor. TWO
               BODIES lie under bloody white sheets on two STEEL TABLES.
               Between them is a small cart -- a bloody cloth on top.
          
               Nakagawa and Igarashi enter. The Coroner stands, nervous.
               He walks to one of the tables and pulls back the sheet.
          
                                   NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                         Have you determined a cause of
                         death?
          
                                   CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                         Not yet. The blood on his body --
                         isn't his. It belongs to her.
          
               He points to the other table.    But doesn't look at it.

                       I don't understand. He killed
                       Yoko, before he died?
          
          The Coroner shakes his head. Nakagawa looks to Igarashi,
          then walks up to the second body, pulling back the sheet.
          
          IT'S YOKO.    Still missing her jawbone.
          
          Nakagawa and Igarashi stare down at her in disbelief.
          
          The Coroner walks to the small table, removing the cloth.
          Yoko's JAWBONE is underneath it.
          
                                 CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                       The jawbone you found in the attic
                       yesterday with the American couple
                       belongs to this girl. I estimate
                       it was -- removed -- from her body
                       two or three days ago.
          
                                 IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE)
                       But I thought you said her body was
                       found with this man, tonight.
          The Coroner nods.    Eyes on his shoes.
          
                                 NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                       Then how did she get from the house
                       to the Health Center?                                
          
          The Coroner, lost in his imagination, answers quietly:
          
                                 CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                       I have no idea.
          
          A beat.   Nakagawa walks to the jawbone.   Stares at it.
          
                                 NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE)
                       She survived for two days without
                       this?
          
                                 CORONER (IN JAPANESE)
                       It would seem so.

                       How is that possible?
          
          The Coroner looks up at him, his face pale.

                 Doug sits on the bed, next to a DRESSING CURTAIN. Karen's
                 silhouette is visible behind it, pulling on her clothes.
          
                 He watches the curtain for a beat, concerned.     Then:
          
                                     DOUG
                           I got us a guidebook to Kyoto. I
                           thought maybe we'd leave tomorrow --
          
                 The curtain suddenly SLIDES BACK.    Karen, dressed, stares at
                 him. She looks angry.
          
                                     KAREN
                           Why didn't you tell me?

                           You were recovering from a shock.
                           I didn't want to --
          
                 Karen turns away, picking up her backpack and slinging it.
                 She walks past him, disappointed, and leaves the room.

                 catches up with her, turning her towards him.
          
                                     DOUG
                           Look, I'm sorry. I was just
                           worried about you, and -- I know
                           you, Karen.

                    The same thing happened three years
                    ago, Doug. To a Japanese family,
                    who lived in that house. They were
                    all found dead.
          
          Doug studies her for a moment.
          
                               DOUG
                    So you think the events are
                    connected?

                              DOUG
                    Okay. How about this: the
                    American family knew about what had
                    happened there before, and this
                    knowledge subconsciously caused
                    them to repeat the same events.
          
          Karen gives Doug a skeptical look.

                    ladder and think uh-oh, you're in
                    for some bad luck, sure enough,
                    what do you know? You trip over --

                              DOUG
                    Makes sense, right?
          
          Karen stops walking.   Considering something.

                    Okay. Then explain this: when I
                    went to that house, I didn't know
                    anything about its past. But yet I
                    still saw...
          
          She hesitates, realizing she's said too much.
          
                                DOUG
                    Saw what?    Karen?
          
                              KAREN
                    Emma and I were alone in that room,
                    but -- there was something else
                    there. I'm sure of it.
          
                              DOUG
                    You watched a woman die, Kat.
                    That's a horrible thing to
                    experience. I can't imagine how
                    you must feel. But sometimes the
                    mind tries to cope with terrible
                    things in a way that distorts what
                    actually occurred.
          
          Karen's eyes never leave his.   Softly, but firmly:
          
                              KAREN
                    You might be right, Doug. But I
                    know what I saw.
                        (then, faltering:)
                    I think I know what I saw...
          
          After a moment, Doug pulls her into a hug.
          
                              DOUG
                    You just need to rest. We'll get
                    you home, get a good night's sleep.
          
                                KAREN
                    Yeah.
          
          But her eyes speak differently. She covers it well, stepping
          back and glancing over at the reception desk:
          
                              KAREN
                    You've got class, and I'm sure I
                    only have to fill out a few forms
                    or something --
          
                                DOUG
                    You sure?

          He kisses her, then exits. He pauses at the front doors to
          give her a little wave. She smiles... but the smile droops
          as soon as he's out of sight.
          
          After a moment, she turns and walks to the front desk.

                Karen sits at her computer desk.   She looks exhausted.
          
                Online, Karen pulls up the home page for The Japan Times, an
                English-language newspaper.
          
                She types Toshio's full name into a SEARCH window.
          
                A LIST of links appear, filling the screen. Karen scans
                them. Tries one. It's not what she's looking for.
          
                She re-enters Toshio's name along with a year -- `2001'.
          
                Only ONE LINK appears.   The word `MURDERED' in the headline.
          
                                         Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      64.
          
          
          
                Karen clicks it.   The article fills the screen.
          
                As Karen reads it, we catch glimpses of names -- `Toshio',
                `Kayako', `Takeo'. And an ominous phrase: "MURDER/SUICIDE".
          
                Karen clicks a link marked `IMAGE'. A scanned picture of the
                newspaper appears -- the article is on the front page, with
                familiar photos of Toshio, Kayako and Takeo.
          
                But then Karen's eyes drift to another picture at the bottom
                of the page --
          
                -- PETER. She quickly recognizes him from the picture she
                found in the journal. His name is printed below the photo.
                A picture of Peter and Maria's CONDO BUILDING is next to it.
          
                She looks at the headline:   "AMERICAN ENGLISH TEACHER THROWS
                SELF FROM BUILDING".
          
                Karen scans the article, thinking.   Then she looks up at --
          
                -- TOSHIO'S PICTURE.

                INT. POLICE STATION - NAKAGAWA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
                Nakagawa is looking at the same picture, in his file.
          
                OFFICER #1 appears in the hall.   Knocks gently on the door.
          
                                     OFFICER #1 (IN JAPANESE)
                           This just came in. It's the
                           surveillance video you requested.
          
                It takes a moment for Nakagawa to snap out of it.
          
                He finally nods, takes the tape. He opens the envelope and
                looks at the cassette. Like he doesn't want to watch it.
          
                Then he turns to a TV/VCR combo and inserts the tape.
          
                ON THE SCREEN: the 10TH FLOOR HALLWAY from Susan's office
                building, and the door leading to the stairwell.
          
                A beat.   The image FLICKERS for a moment.
          
                Then the door suddenly bursts open and Susan, terrified, runs
                from the stairwell and down the hall.
          
                ON NAKAGAWA:   he fast-forwards the video.   Until --

                ON SCREEN: -- the SECURITY GUARD appears in the hallway.        As
                Susan saw earlier, he opens the door to the stairwell and
                looks inside. Then he closes the door and continues o.s.
          
                ON NAKAGAWA:   he reaches forward to turn off the video --
          
                ON SCREEN:   -- but then the video CRACKLES with a quick burst
                of static.   And the door to the stairwell opens again.
          
                ON NAKAGAWA: he's watching, entranced, terrified.      He can
                hardly believe what he's seeing --
          
                ON SCREEN: -- A DARK FIGURE EMERGES FROM THE STAIRWELL.    It's
                the shape of a woman with long hair --
          
                -- but the figure is BLURRY AND SHIFTING, as if the black
                shadow has loosely compacted itself into the form of a human.
          
                NAKAGAWA watches, breathless, as THE FIGURE slowly enters the
                hallway, passing by, underneath the camera.
          
                The image stops flickering.    An empty hallway now.   A beat.
          
                Nakagawa, his hand shaking, reaches forward, about to turn
                off the television set, when --
          
                DARKNESS SUDDENLY OVERTAKES THE SCREEN, rising up from the
                bottom until everything is dark. A strange HUMMING RATTLE
                comes from the speakers, and the image JITTERS madly.
          
                Nakagawa leans forward, right up to the screen, trying to
                make out an image in the swirling blackness --
          
                Two eyes open, staring at Nakagawa.
                Terrified, Nakagawa stands and turns away, closing his eyes.
          
                And when he finds the strength to look back --
          
                -- THE EYES are still there.
          
                Locked onto him, even though he's moved.
          
                Unflinching.   Unblinking.

                EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
                Nakagawa stands at the front door.    Gathering his courage.

                 He opens the door.   Nothing but yawning darkness inside.
          
                 Nakagawa picks up TWO HEAVY OBJECTS, one in each hand, and,
                 ducking under the police tape, enters the house.
          
          
          106    INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                            106
          
                 Nakagawa puts the two heavy objects by the front door and
                 closes it. Now we can see what they are --
          
                 -- GASOLINE CANS.    Two gallons each.   Full.
          
                 Nakagawa catches his breath. Then he reaches for the lid of
                 one of the cans, starting to unscrew it. His hands are
                 shaking, and the gasoline SPLASHES AROUND inside --
          
                 -- but then there's ANOTHER SPLASHING SOUND.     From nearby.
          
                 Nakagawa freezes.    The splashing continues.    His eyes go to --
          
                 THE BATHROOM DOOR. It's closed. The SPLASHING is coming
                 from inside, accompanied by a series of THUDS. The sounds of
                 a small child, STRUGGLING...
          
                 Nakagawa fearfully reaches for the door handle --
          
          106a                                                               106a
                 INT. THE HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
                 Nakagawa's eyes widen as the door swings open.     He sees --
          
                 A YOUNG BOY kneeling by the edge of the tub, overflowing with
                 water. His head hangs below the surface.
          
                 Nakagawa immediately drops to the boy, lifting his lifeless
                 head from the water. It's TOSHIO. He's dead. Drowned.
          
                 Before Nakagawa can understand what's happening, the boy's
                 eyes SUDDENLY OPEN, fixing on Nakagawa --
          
                 -- and then a PALE HAND grabs Nakagawa's head from behind and
                 roughly pushes it into the water, holding him under.
          
                 Nakagawa's LEGS flail and kick as he struggles, his SCREAMING
                 muffled by the water. But finally, his legs become still.

                 Karen is in the shower. She stands there, glassy-eyed, as
                 the water runs over her. She's looking at --
          
                 -- HER REFLECTION in the mirror. It fogs up, obscuring the
                 view. This snaps Karen out of her trance.
          
                 She rinses her hair and squeezes some shampoo into her hand.
                 Starts a nice lather.
          
                 FROM BEHIND: Karen works the shampoo into her scalp.   But,
                 as she does, we see something...
          
                 ... A PALE HAND BURIED UNDER HER HAIR, as if someone is
                 behind her, with a hand on her head.
          
                 Karen's fingers brush the hand.   She CRIES OUT and turns --
          
                 -- there's no one there.   She's alone.

                There's the sound of the front door UNLOCKING and Doug
                enters, carrying a bag. He closes the door behind him and
                walks in, turning the corner --
          
                -- finding Karen, looking a bit dazed, standing right there.
                He's startled, but quickly recovers:
          
                                    DOUG
                          I come bearing gifts.
          
                Karen smiles weakly. She takes the bag and enters the
                kitchen. He watches her go, worried. Then he notices --
          
                HER DESK. Doug walks over, looking at the printouts she's
                taped to the wall. And the photo of The House in the center.
          
                Bewildered, he sits down, leaning forward and taking a good
                look. His eyes stop on the picture of TOSHIO.
          
                Doug turns to see Karen staring at him from the kitchen.
                It's an awkward moment: he's concerned, but doesn't know
                what to say. And neither does Karen.
          
                Finally she approaches, looking at Toshio's picture:

                     That's the boy who was there
                     yesterday. In that house. But
                     this boy, he's --
          
          Her voice trembles, her fear showing through.
          
                               KAREN
                     -- he's supposed to be dead.
          
          A beat.   Karen's eyes plead with Doug.
          
                               KAREN
                     I saw him, Doug. I talked to him.
                     He told me his name. A boy who was
                     killed by his father three years
                     ago told me his name.
          
          Doug looks away, shaking his head.
          
                               KAREN
                     You don't believe me.
          
                               DOUG
                     How can I believe you, Karen?
          
          Karen's face darkens.   Before she can retort --
          
          -- the phone RINGS. As Karen walks across the room to answer
          it, Doug starts reading the newspaper article.
          
                               KAREN (INTO PHONE)
                     Hello?
          
          She listens.   Her face slowly drops.
          
                               KAREN
                         (almost a whisper:)
                     What?
          
          She numbly lowers the phone.   Doug turns to her, seeing that
          something's very wrong.
          
          Snapping to life, Karen walks to the desk, picking up the
          photo of Peter and Maria's condo and a map of Tokyo.
          
          Doug puts a hand on her shoulder.    She finally looks at him.
          
                               KAREN
                     Alex and Yoko are dead.
          
          Doug, surprised, doesn't know what to say.   Karen doesn't
          give him a chance to figure it out:

                        (intense:)
                    There's something wrong with that
                    house, Doug. Something really bad.
                        (re: Peter's photo)
                    The boy in that house, he had a
                    photo of this man. He died on that
                    same day three years ago. I need
                    to talk to his wife... widow. If I
                    can find out what happened, or
                    if... maybe --
          
                              DOUG
                    Maybe, what?
          
          Karen pulls away, making for the door.   Doug follows.
          
                              DOUG
                    I'm concerned about you going out
                    while you're so upset --
          
                              KAREN
                    You don't understand.   I have to,
                    Doug.
          
                              DOUG
                    Why?
          
                              KAREN
                    Because I've been inside that
                    house, Doug. Don't you get it?
                    I've been inside!

          A beat. We see the resolve come over Karen's face.   She
          reaches out and touches Doug tenderly.
          
                              KAREN
                    I love you. But I have to go.
          
          She leaves.
          
          Doug, troubled, turns back to the desk.
          
          He looks up at the wall, tracing a finger over the photo of
          The House. Beneath it, is the address...

          115   EXT. CONDO BUILDING - DAY                                 115
          
                The same building from the newspaper clipping.   Monolithic
                against a cloudy, bleak sky.
          
                Karen stands before it, staring up at it.
          
                Then she walks to the intercom and looks at the directory,
                finds `M. Kirk'. She activates the intercom and dials the
                number. It rings a few times, and then a voice picks up:
          
                                      MARIA (INTERCOM, IN JAPANESE)
                          Yes?
          
                                    KAREN
                          I'm looking for Maria Kirk?
          
                                    MARIA (INTERCOM)
                          Who is this?
          
                                    KAREN
                          My name is Karen Davies. I'm a
                          student at -- I'm sorry to bother
                          you, but I was wondering if I could
                          ask you a few questions.
          
                A long beat.   Karen stares at the intercom.
          
                                      KAREN
                          Ms. Kirk?
          
                                    MARIA (INTERCOM)
                          Questions about what?
          
                                    KAREN
                          I'm here because... I need to speak
                          with you about your husband.
          
                When Maria's voice comes back through the intercom, she
                sounds different, shaken:
          
                                    MARIA (INTERCOM)
                          Leave me alone.
          
                                      KAREN
                          Maria --
          
                                      MARIA (INTERCOM)
                          Please.
          
                Karen stands there for a moment.   Then, as she walks away --

                 The front door opens. MARIA (early 30s) has changed from
                 when we first saw her -- she wears a revealing outfit, and
                 her natural beauty now smolders beneath the surface.
          
                 She regards Karen warily.
          
                                     MARIA
                           I'm late for work.
          
                                     KAREN
                           I just need a couple minutes.
          
                 Maria finally steps aside, letting Karen in.
          
                 The APARTMENT is small, and completely unkempt.    The kitchen
                 is a mess, clothes lie everywhere.
          
                                     MARIA
                               (sarcastic:)
                           Make yourself at home.
          
                 Karen looks for a place to sit.    She decides to stand.
          
                 Maria sizes her up.   A beat.   Then:
          
                                       MARIA
                           Well?
          
                                     KAREN
                           Your husband, Peter.    Three years
                           ago he...
          
                 She trails off, in delicate territory.
          
                                       MARIA
                           He what?
          
                                     KAREN
                           He killed himself.
          
                 Maria eyes her blankly. Then she turns to look at something
                 o.s. Karen follows her gaze --
          
                 -- to the open door of THE BEDROOM.     And THE WINDOW beyond.

                              KAREN
                        (almost ashamed:)
                    I'm... sorry.
          
          Maria turns back to her, sadness on her face.   Then:
          
                                 MARIA
                    Thank you.
          
          Maria reaches for a pack of cigarettes.   Lights one.   Offers
          them to Karen. She shakes her head.
          
                              MARIA
                    How did you know Peter?
          
                                 KAREN
                    I didn't.
          
                              MARIA
                    Then what are you doing here?
          
                              KAREN
                    I think there's a connection
                    between your husband's death and
                    something that happened to me.
          
                              MARIA
                    What happened to you?
          
                              KAREN
                    It's... hard to explain.
          
          Maria takes a drag from her cigarette.    Waiting.
          
                              KAREN
                    Look, I know this sounds strange,
                    but... I don't think your husband
                    wanted to die.
          
                              MARIA
                        (even:)
                    Then why would he throw himself out
                    a window?
          
          Karen struggles to find the answer.
          
                              MARIA
                    Let me guess: `hard to explain'?
          
          Karen nods.   Maria's brave face slips.   She turns away.

                              MARIA
                    I put all this behind me. I don't
                    want to open it back up again.
          
                              KAREN
                    If that's true, then why are you
                    still here in Japan?
          
          Maria turns back.   She only looks defensive for a moment.
          
                              MARIA
                    Because I can't leave. I tried.
                    But I couldn't. Not without...
          
          Maria speaks softly, forming words she's never spoken aloud:
          
                              MARIA
                    He usually didn't wake up before
                    me. But that morning, he did. He
                    made coffee for us. Then he sat
                    there and waited for me to wake up.
                    And when I did, he looked me right
                    in the eye. And then he jumped.
                    The night before we'd been talking
                    about having children together...
          
          She wipes away the tears in her eyes.

                    I don't think so.
          
          Maria turns away, growing tense.
          
                              KAREN
                    Maybe it was someone he worked
                    with?

                    Look. I've had the police up here,
                    I talked with Detectives, I even
                    hired a P.I.--

                              MARIA (cont'd)
                    I don't know what you're going
                    through, or what you think you know
                    about my husband. But I don't have
                    any answers. I'm sorry.
          
          She turns back to Karen -- to find the young woman sitting
          slumped on the edge of a sofa, tears in her eyes.
          
          Maria softens as Karen looks up at her, pleading:
          
                             KAREN
                    Please. I don't know what else to
                    do. Please help me.

                 Maria reaches up to a high shelf. She moves a few things
                 aside to get to TWO SHOEBOXES buried towards the rear.
          
          
          118    OMITTED                                                     118

                 Maria re-enters the room, laying the shoeboxes on a table.
          
                                     MARIA
                           This is all his stuff from school.
          
                 She stares at the boxes, afraid to open them. Karen sits
                 down and gently removes the lid of one of them.
          
                 THE BOX contains stacks of PHOTOGRAPHS and notes. Karen
                 removes a pile of photos and starts looking through it.
          
                 After a moment, Maria sits down next to her. She opens the
                 other box and pulls out another stack of photos.
          
                 She looks at the first one, sadness crossing her face.
          
                                     MARIA
                           This was our first date.
          
                 She shows Karen THE TOP PHOTO: a "self-portrait" of Peter
                 and Maria in a park lined with blooming cherry trees.
          
                 The pain returns, and she puts the picture away.
          
                 Karen works through her own pile: she's looking at pictures
                 of Peter from his University days.
          
                 Her eyes widen as she sees --
          
                 Kayako. She looks young and alive... but yet somehow sullen
                 and withdrawn, as if she feels she doesn't belong there.
          
                 She's with a group of fellow students. PETER is in the
                 group, although he and Kayako aren't next to one another.
          
                 Karen turns to the next picture -- it's a graduation party.
          
                 Kayako is in this one too: standing to the side, watching
                 PETER AND MARIA as they give a goofy grin to the camera.

          As Karen flips through them, a definite pattern emerges --
          
          -- Kayako is in practically every picture.
          
          And in most, she's not smiling at the camera.    Rather, she's
          staring at Peter.
          
                               KAREN
                        (under her breath:)

                    What?   Did you find something?
          
          We move to THE GROUP PHOTO. Peter with Maria, surrounded by
          classmates. Kayako off to the side, her eyes on Peter.

                The same GROUP PHOTO is in a frame on Peter's desk.
          
                Peter stands behind the desk, using a small mirror to knot
                his tie. His open door reads: `DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH'.
          
                A CO-WORKER (20s, Japanese) enters with a stack of mail.
          
                                    PETER
                          Happy Monday.
          
                                    CO-WORKER
                          Yeah, right. Here's your mail.
          
                He hands it to Peter. On the top is a small BLUE ENVELOPE.
                The name in the return address is `Kayako'.

                           Another one, huh?
          
                 Peter shakes his head, looking distastefully at the letter.
          
                                     PETER
                           I don't even know her. She says I
                           used to tutor her, but I don't know
                           who the hell she is.
          
                 The co-worker shrugs and leaves.    Disturbed, Peter fingers
                 the blue envelope.
          
                 His eyes go to one of his desk drawers.    He slides it open.
          
                 More BLUE ENVELOPES are inside.    All from `KAYAKO'.
          
                 Peter's face darkens.   He dumps the letters into a trash can.

                 EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
                 Peter stands in front of The House.
          
                 He glances down at the BLUE ENVELOPE in his hand. He stuffs
                 it in his pocket, unsure about what he's going to do.
          
                 Then he opens the gate and goes in, walking to the front
                 door. Knocks. Silence from inside. He rings the bell.
                 Waits. No one comes. He's about to leave --
          
                 But then he hears something from around the side of the
                 house. It sounded like a muffled SPLASH of water.
          
          
          120a   EXT. THE HOUSE - SIDE - DAY                                120a
          
                 Peter peers around the side of the house, a narrow walkway
                 lined with bushes and trees. It's quiet.
          
                                      PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                           Hello?   Excuse me?
          
                 After a moment, Peter decides to check it out. As he steps
                 around a bush, he suddenly stops, surprised to see --
          
                 PETER'S POV: two ARMS hang from a window at the side of the
                 house. They look disembodied, mottled and bruised.

          It takes Peter a moment to recover.   He slowly walks over.

                A familiar BOY is inside -- it's TOSHIO. His glazed and
                staring eyes don't seem to notice Peter, standing right in
                front of him.
          
                                     PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          Hello.
          
                No reaction. There's definitely something wrong with this
                boy. Peter looks beyond him, into the dark house.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          My name is Peter. I'm here to see
                          your mother. Is she home?
          
                The boy slowly straightens. His eyes focus on Peter. Then
                he FALLS BACKWARDS. Startled, Peter tries to see inside:
          
                                     PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          Hey!   Are you okay??? Hello???
          
                Peter quickly goes back to the front door.   Tries the handle -
                - it's unlocked. He opens the door.
          
          121                                                              121
                INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY
                Peter steps inside, unsure about entering uninvited.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                              (calling out)
                          Hello? Excuse me. I'm coming in.
          
                His concern for the boy wins out. He kicks off his shoes,
                and quickly walks to the open bathroom door.

                Peter enters, finding Toshio lying on the floor. He must
                have been standing on the edge of a TUB by the window.

                          Are you alright?
          
                As Peter helps the boy to his feet, he glances at the
                bathtub. It's filled, literally to the brim, with water.
          
          
          124   INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                             124
          
                Peter holds Toshio's hand as he leads him back to a couch in
                the living room.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          Are you alone? Where are your
                          parents?
          
                The boy sits in the couch, slumped over, still looking dazed.
          
                Peter studies him, looking at the ugly BRUISES on his arms
                and legs. There's also a big one around his neck.
          
                                    PETER (IN JAPANESE)
                          What happened to you?
          
                Peter reaches out to lift Toshio's chin, but he FLINCHES,
                pulling backwards. His eyes manage to focus on Peter.
          
                Then the boy looks away.    Lowers his head.   A long beat.
          
                Peter's worried. This really doesn't look good.     He scans
                the messy room, eyes falling on something.
          
                He reaches down and picks up PIECES OF A PHOTOGRAPH, lying
                next to a broken frame -- they've been crumpled into a ball.
          
                ON THE PHOTO: Peter unfolds the pieces and rearranges them.
                We've seen this picture before --
          
                -- a FAMILY PORTRAIT. TOSHIO, holding a cute BLACK CAT.
                Standing with his mother and father -- KAYAKO and TAKEO.
                They're all beaming at the camera, a perfect, happy family.
          
                Except that the mother's face has been torn out.
          
                Then there's a muffled MEOW.    Peter looks over at the window.
                Did that come from outside?
          
                Another MEOW.   Peter walks to the window, looking out.
          
                FROM OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN: a worried look crosses Peter's
                face as the MEOW becomes more of a GROWL, as if in warning.
                He looks outside, but can't see anything --

                -- but we see, over Peter's shoulder, that TOSHIO is now
                LOOKING DIRECTLY AT HIM, eyes wide --
          
                -- the MEOWING emitting from his wide open mouth --

                Karen enters quickly, going up to the front desk.
          
                OFFICER #2, filling out paperwork, doesn't look up.

                                    OFFICER #2 (IN JAPANESE)
                          One moment.
          
                Officer #2 walks to the end of the desk, where two more
                OFFICERS speak in hushed tones with DETECTIVE AOKI.
          
                Officer #2 interrupts their conversation. And they all look
                over at Karen. A beat. Then Detective Aoki approaches.
          
                                    AOKI (IN ENGLISH)
                          You are asking for Detective
                          Nakagawa?
          
                                    KAREN
                          Yes, I have important information
                          for him about a case...
          
                She looks around. Everyone is watching her. The mood is
                decidedly grim. She can tell something's up.
          
                                    AOKI
                          Detective Nakagawa is not here
                          right now. Can you tell me what
                          case this is regarding?
          
                There's something behind the Detective's words.
          
                                    KAREN
                          His partner, Detective Igarashi?
                          Can I speak with him?

                Aoki exchanges a look with the officers.
          
                                    AOKI
                          Can you tell me your name, please?
          
                Karen looks at the somber faces in the quiet station.     She
                backs away from the desk as the realization sinks in.
          
                                    KAREN
                          They're dead, aren't they?
          
                Karen turns and runs for the exit.
          
                                    AOKI
                          Miss, wait please --
          
                But she's long gone.

                INT. KAREN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                A reading light on the computer desk provides the only
                illumination in the dark apartment.
          
                Karen enters, standing in the doorway for a moment.     Shell-
                shocked. As she slides off her coat:
          
                                       KAREN
                          Doug?

          No answer. She slowly walks to the bedroom and looks inside.
          He's not there. This seems to worsen Karen's mood.
          
                                     Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       84.
          
          
          
          Karen looks down at a NOTEPAD. She's written THREE JAPANESE
          NAMES. The detectives in charge of the case three years ago.
          
          They all have red lines drawn through them.
          
          Then we PAN UP to see that these are the last names on a
          longer list. We recognize the other names: MATTHEW,
          JENNIFER, and EMMA WILLIAMS; YOKO and ALEX; NAKAGAWA and
          IGARASHI. Everyone who's been in The House.
          
          Everyone who died.   All the names have been CROSSED OUT --
          
          -- except `Nakagawa' and `Igarashi'.    Karen picks up a red
          pen and draws a line through them.
          
          Then we see one final name at the bottom:
          
          `Me.'   Now the only one not crossed out.   The only one left.
          
          Karen puts down her pen.    Then she looks up at --
          
          -- THE WALL, where's she's taped all the pictures and
          articles in a circle.
          
          Karen realizes something.    She reaches for the lamp, and
          turns it closer --
          
          -- the picture in the middle of the "spider's web" is gone.
          
          The photo of The House.
          
          Karen draws a breath. Then, out of the corner of her eye,
          she sees something she hadn't noticed before --
          
          -- a faint red FLASHING from a small table by the kitchen.
          
          She slowly stands. Walks over to it. The flashing red light
          is barely visible on her face, as she looks down at --
          
          -- HER ANSWERING MACHINE.    The message light is blinking.
          
          `1 MESSAGE'.
          
          She reaches out a shaky finger and presses `PLAY'.
          
                               DOUG (ON MACHINE)
                     "Hey, Karen. It's me. I just
                     wanted to say -- I'm sorry. I know
                     I wasn't hearing you.

                            If all this is real to you, then
                            it's important to me, and I'm gonna
                            check that house out. So just sit
                            tight, I won't be long. I love
                            you."
          
                  Karen presses the STOP button.
          
                  She stands there for a moment, in the near-darkness.
          
                  Then, softly:
          
                                        KAREN
                            No.

                  Karen runs outside, struggling to pull on her coat.    She
                  races down the sidewalk at top speed.

                  Doug stands at the gate, lighting a cigarette, looking down
                  at the POLICE TAPE sealing the entrance. He pockets his
                  Zippo and ducks under the tape, walking up to --
          
                  THE FRONT DOOR. Doug tries the handle, and the door swings
                  open. He stands on the porch, looking into the dark place.

                  Karen runs down the steps from the train, racing into the
                  SHOPPING DISTRICT.

                  Doug steps inside, trying the light switch. Nothing happens.
                  But he smiles, shaking his head, completely unafraid.
          
                                        DOUG
                            Hello?
          
                  As he takes a step forward his foot bumps THE GAS CANS, still
                  sitting by the front door.
          
                  He's confused -- and then he gets a good idea.   He tosses his
                  cigarette outside and closes the front door.

                 Doug walks through the living room, glancing inside the small
                 KITCHEN, then he slides open the door to the TATAMI ROOM.
          
                 He winces as his eyes meet the STAINED MATTRESS.

                 Doug re-enters the entryway, looking back up to the second
                 floor. He starts up.

                 Doug walks to the FRONT ROOM door and opens it. He leans
                 inside, trying to let his eyes adjust to the dark.
          
                 Then he walks down the hall to the REAR ROOM.   Does the same.
                 Nothing but darkness beyond.
          
                 Doug closes the door and turns away from it, wondering why
                 he's here, what he's looking for.
          
                 He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cell phone.
                 Speed-dials Karen's number. As he raises it to his ear --
          
                 -- he doesn't notice the door to the rear room SLOWLY
                 SWINGING OPEN BEHIND HIM --

                 Karen runs towards us, breathless, stopping as she reaches --
          
                 -- THE HOUSE.   Looming over her.    Waiting.
          
                 She only hesitates a moment before running inside.

                 Karen enters, calling out:
          
                                      KAREN
                           Doug!   Where are you???
          
                 A MUFFLED SOUND from upstairs.    A voice.
          
                                      KAREN
                           Doug???
          
                 Karen immediately runs up the stairs to --
          
                 THE SECOND FLOOR. Before she reaches the top of the stairs,
                 Karen suddenly realizes:
          
                 THE VOICE she's hearing isn't Doug's.
          
                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                           Hey, Maria, it's me. Yeah, I'm
                           still at school...
          
                 Karen slowly looks up to see --
          
                                         Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        87.
          
          
          
                -- PETER. She recognizes him immediately.    He's standing in
                the hallway, talking on his cell phone.
          
                                    PETER (INTO PHONE)
                          ...I know, I'm sorry -- these staff
                          meetings always run over -- maybe
                          another ten minutes or so -- okay,
                          I'll be home soon -- I love you
                          too.
          
                He hangs up.   Leans against the wall.   Looking into --
          
                THE FRONT BEDROOM. Karen gasps as she sees TOSHIO through
                the open door. He's sitting on the ground, making drawings
                of BLACK CATS. This is his bedroom.
          
                                    PETER
                              (under his breath)
                          Guess your mom's late, huh?
          
                Then Toshio suddenly looks up.   Right at Karen.
          
                Following Toshio's gaze, Peter quickly turns to face Karen.
                But even though she's right there, he doesn't see her:
          
                She's seeing something that happened three years ago.
          
                As if sensing her presence, Peter walks right to the edge of
                the stairs, looking down. Then:
          
                A RUSTLING SOUND comes from the dark hallway. Peter turns
                towards the REAR BEDROOM at the end of the hall.
          
          129                                                                129
                INT. THE HOUSE - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
                Peter stands in the doorway, looking into the MASTER BEDROOM
                of Toshio's parents. His attention is drawn to something
                near the door --
          
                -- a DESK. It's got a computer, some files.     Someone's
                personal work space.
          
                Peter steps to the desk. He picks up A STACK OF PHOTOGRAPHS.
                Family pictures: with father (TAKEO), mother (KAYAKO), and
                son (TOSHIO), holding his black CAT.
          
                KAYAKO'S FACE has been torn out of every one.
          
                Peter notices something underneath the pile of photos -- a
                familiar JOURNAL. The same one Karen found in the closet.
                He opens it.
          
                                   Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        88.
          
          
          
          HIS POV: it's a journal Kayako kept. As Peter flips through
          it, KAYAKO'S VOICE speaks the words...
          
          ...and even though it's mostly Japanese, there's one word we
          recognize, that she's written repeatedly --
          
          -- "Peter". It's been written over and over, in both English
          and Japanese, as if she couldn't get enough of seeing it.
          
          Past the early pages Karen saw, THE WRITING becomes more
          manic, the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl,
          KAYAKO'S VOICE becomes more desperate and pleading.
          
          Taped on the final page is A PHOTO: PETER with a group of
          his University friends, at a party. Kayako has scribbled
          hearts around his head, and SCRATCHED OUT the other faces.
          
          A bloody THUMBPRINT distorts Peter's face.   It's still wet.
          
          Peter slams the book shut and drops it. As he does, a
          PHOTOGRAPH falls out from inside, landing right-side up.
          
          THE PHOTO is of PETER at a college party, talking with MARIA.
          It's clear they're having a great time with one another...
          
          ...but the photo is TORN IN HALF, splitting Maria's face.
          And KAYAKO is visible between them, sadly and stoically
          watching Peter, strands of hair falling down her face.
          
          Peter and Karen both reach to pick up the photo at the same
          time -- and they BUMP SHOULDERS. Karen falls backwards,
          against the wall.
          
          In disbelief, Peter looks around wildly. He reaches out a
          tentative hand, feeling around... Karen moves out of the way.
          She can't understand how this could be happening.
          
          As Peter is about to stand back up, SOMETHING small flutters
          down from above, landing on the floor in front of him.
          
          It's KAYAKO'S FACE.   One of the missing pieces from the torn-
          out photographs.
          
          Peter slowly looks up to see --
          
          -- ALL THE MISSING KAYAKO FACES have been pinned to the
          closet door. Many of the pins go through HER EYES.
          
          And that's when Peter and Karen hear THE FLIES.   Buzzing
          anxiously. Sounds like there's a lot of them.
          
          It's coming from THE CLOSET.   Just behind the torn-out faces.

          Karen watches, terrified, as Peter reaches out a hand --
          
          -- and slides the door open.
          
          He immediately recoils.    A terrible stench inside.
          
          The BUZZING of the flies is louder.    Coming from above.
          
          Peter pulls a book of matches from his pocket.    Lights one.
          
          And looks up.
          
          HIS POV:   the attic panel is slightly open.
          
          Peter reaches up to open it fully --
          
          -- AND THE UPPER HALF OF KAYAKO swings down.
          
          She's been wrapped in plastic sheeting, mottled splotches of
          blood on the inside. Her neck hangs at an odd angle.

                Peter backs away in horror --
          
          
          130   INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT               130
          
                Peter backs into the hallway, breathing hard.
          
                Then a familiar sound reaches our ears:   THUD.   THUD.   THUD.
          
                It's coming from Toshio's room. And it's the same rhythmic
                THUDDING we've heard coming from this room before.
          
                Peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads
                quickly down the hall (with Karen following him):
          
                                     PETER
                          Toshio!   We have to --
          
                He stops short at the door, as he sees --
          
                -- TAKEO, Toshio's father. Eyes rolled back in his head,
                tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips.
          
                He's dead -- he's hanging from the ceiling by BLACK HAIR that
                seems to cover its entire surface. Kayako's hair.
          
                TOSHIO, now back to his "dead" appearance, playfully swings
                the body. Takeo's feet THUD rhythmically against the wall.
          
                                    KAREN
                          Oh my God...
          
                Peter doesn't stay to see any more.   He runs.

                INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
          
                Peter tears down the stairs and runs for the front door,
                passing a mirror --
          
                -- he freezes. He saw SOMETHING in the reflection as he
                passed. Something wrong.
                He takes a step back and looks --
          
                -- it's not his reflection in the mirror.   It's KAYAKO.
          
                Peter stares at the image in disbelief. Then he notices
                TOSHIO standing next to Kayako, looking up at her.

          As Peter slowly turns to look down, a small PALE HAND slips
          into his own. Peter jerks backward in shock as --

          -- KAYAKO running down the steps, TAKEO chasing her, tackling
          her before she can reach the door... sitting on top of her,
          he wraps his hands around her neck...
          
          -- KAYAKO seeing TOSHIO, her son, watching through the bars

          -- KAYAKO suddenly TURNING HER HEAD and GRABBING TAKEO'S
          ARM... her lifeless eyes focusing on Takeo's as she CROAKS...
          Takeo's eyes go wide with fear... and TOSHIO suddenly reaches
          from his plastic grave, grabbing Takeo's other arm...
          
          BACK TO THE PRESENT:
          
          We PAN FROM Peter to THE REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR --
          
          It's not the pale, frightening Kayako anymore. Rather:     a
          beautiful, young Kayako with eyes filled with sorrow.
          
          We PAN BACK to see KAREN standing there, instead of Peter.
          
          Karen slumps to the ground in front of the mirror, the
          revelation taking everything out of her.
          
          A beat.   Then:
                    That came from upstairs.
          THUMP.
          Karen looks up as the sound continues. We PAN OVER towards
          the stairs as A DRAGGING sound moves across the ceiling.
          Accompanied by a strange SCRAPING, like plastic.
          
                                KAREN
                      No more... please, no more...
          
          She suddenly freezes, sensing something next to her. We see
          it now, as she turns her head, almost hidden in the darkness--

          -- a PALE FACE in the darkened hallway, staring up at the
          ceiling. Eyes wide and rolled back, mouth yawning open in
          abject terror --
          
          -- it's DOUG'S BODY. He lies on his back, his top half
          sticking out from a niche by the stairwell. It's been right
          next to her all along.
          
                               KAREN
                    DOUG!   NO!!!
          
          Karen takes Doug into her arms as the SOUNDS continue above,
          growing closer. But it's no use -- he's dead.
          
          And now there's a new sound, moving down the stairs. A
          familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND, along with a strange
          SKITTERING, like the world's biggest cockroach.
          
          Karen turns to the staircase to see --
          
          -- KAYAKO, crawling down the stairs. Still wrapped in the
          plastic sheeting, she moves like a wounded animal, neck
          hanging limply, struggling to pull herself forward --
          
          -- her eyes locked on Karen, CROAKING horribly --
          
          Karen sorrow turns to abject terror. She tries to lift
          Doug's body and pull it to the front door. It's too heavy.
          
          And KAYAKO is getting closer.
          
          Sobbing, Karen drops Doug and falls back against the front
          door, bumping into --
          
          THE GAS CANS. The one Nakagawa unscrewed TIPS OVER, spilling
          gasoline into the entryway.
          
          As Doug's arm flops to the floor, his outstretched HAND lands
          next to Karen. She sees something clenched in his fingers --
          
          -- his ZIPPO LIGHTER.
          
          Realization dawns over Karen as she feels the liquid spilling
          onto her hands. The odor is unmistakable.
          
          Karen immediately reaches forward, trying to loosen Doug's
          grip on the lighter as --
          
          -- Kayako reaches the bottom of the stairs. Her broken neck
          makes a horrific CRACKING as she swivels to face Karen.
          
          Karen finally gets the lighter. She pushes back against the
          door with legs too numb to stand. Her eyes drift up to see --

          -- TOSHIO, watching from the railing above, as before, his
          cold eyes locked on hers.
          
          Karen grabs another can, and spins the lid until it pops off.
          She tips it onto the floor, spilling more gas.

                 Kayako doesn't seem to care. She crawls over Doug's body and
                 pulls herself through the gasoline, slowly, drawing
                 inexorably closer --
          
                 Karen drops the empty gas can and opens DOUG'S LIGHTER.
          
                 She flicks it.   Nothing.
          
                 Karen tries the lighter again.     And again.   Nothing.
          
                 Kayako reaches out, blood dripping from her gaping mouth --
          
                 The lighter CATCHES.
          
                 Karen flails with her free arm and opens the front door --
          
                 -- just as Kayako GRABS HER ANKLE.
          
                 Karen reaches outside, anchoring a hand to the door frame --
          
                 -- but she can't pull herself free, as --
          
                 -- Kayako pulls herself closer, her CROAKING intensifying --
          
                 -- resigned, Karen slowly lowers the flame to the gas can --
          
                 -- and ignites the gas!     There's a sudden BRIGHT FLASH that

                 The flashing lights of POLICE CARS wash over the formerly
                 quiet neighborhood, illuminating --

                 KAREN. She's lying on a gurney, regaining consciousness.
                 Japanese EMTS are speaking to her as she's being loaded into
                 the back of an ambulance.
          
                 KAREN'S POV: the blurry forms of FIREMEN rush by in slow
                 motion. Everything is dizzy and incoherent...
          
                 Karen tries to sit up -- but a YOUNG EMT lays a gentle hand
                 on her arm, deftly sliding a needle under her skin. The
                 sedative takes hold almost immediately.
          
                 Karen sinks back into the gurney, her eyes rolling back in
                 her head. She's fading fast.

                 The EMTs secure the gurney inside and close the doors. Karen
                 fights the drug, but its grip is inevitable: she finally
                 gives up, sliding into a medicated sleep.
          
                 We slowly MOVE IN on her face, until it fills the screen.

                 ...the light CHANGES. Darkness becomes morning sunlight
                 spilling across Karen's face. The tranquil sound of birds
                 CHIRPING surrounds us. But it sounds like a distant echo.
          
                 Karen's eyelids flutter. She opens her eyes and sits up, now
                 wide awake -- but peaceful and calm.
          
                 She gently swings her legs from the gurney and walks to the
                 window, confused by the daylight. She looks out to see --

                 It's the most beautiful we've ever seen it.   A lush
                 springtime bloom fills the trees and bushes around the place.
          
                 VOICES off-screen (Japanese) are audible, getting closer --

          ON KAREN, as she is surprised to see...
          
          KAYAKO. Beautiful and meek. She's smiling, walking hand-in-
          hand with TAKEO. A happy couple.
          
          As they reach the front door and go inside, Kayako turns back
          to the front gate. She smiles and gestures, "come on".
          
          And then TOSHIO walks forward, through the gate.   His
          attention is on a tiny BLACK KITTEN in his arms.
          
          At the door, Toshio turns to look back over his shoulder --
          
          -- DIRECTLY AT KAREN. They hold each other's gaze for a
          moment, as if he somehow sees her in the ambulance.
          
          Then Kayako gestures to Toshio, and he turns away, entering
          The House and closing the door.

          barbed-wire fencing.                                             
                         
          A RENTAL CAR pulls up to the SECURITY GATE. A SECURITY GUARD     
          checks the credentials of the driver. The Guard nods to the      
          GUARD BOOTH. The GATE OPENS. The rental car drives through.      
                         
                         
          INT. SECURITY STATION. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
                         
          CLOSE ON: A HAND holding a MICROPHONE. The hand cranes the       
          mike around the to pick up sounds of maniacal laughter           
          echoing from the corridor.                                       
                         
          INSERTS of the corresponding inspiration of these sounds.
                         
          REVEAL: DANA HAINES (30's), activating a TAPE RECORDER. She's
          with AARON JOSEPH-KOREY (40); both scholarly, British. Aaron
          signs some documents at a CHECK-IN DESK. They look to each
          other. Aaron speaks into her microphone.
                         
                                             DANA
                    Check, check.

          Among the SECURITY GUARDS, a NURSE works behind the security
          desk of what looks to be a minimum security institution. The
          nurse places a needle on a record player. A joyous song from
          a 1930's musical plays.
                         
          Aaron looks through the security window and sees a DOCTOR
          writing something down and speaking to a PATIENT and a guard,
          KUNEMAN. His ballpoint pen runs out of ink. He shakes it,
          discards it and then reaches into his lab coat pocket for a
          more elegant pen to complete his prescription and signature.
          He glances through the glass at his visitors.
                         
          Dana raises her mic to the door. WE HEAR SOUNDS through
          warped distortion. THEN: A loud BUZZER snaps us back to          
          reality as a ward activates the door lock.
                         
          CLOSE ON: The mechanics of the security locks, bars, etc.
                                                                   2.
                         
                         
          A GREEN LIGHT FLASHES as the door opens and DR. RANBIR         
          SARTAIN appears. A psychiatrist with a thick accent.           
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Good afternoon. I'm Dr. Ranbir
                    Sartain.
                         
                                             DANA
                    Thank you for taking the time to
                    meet with us. We were hoping to
                    have this chance before he is
                    transferred to the new facility.
                    Glass Hill is far less                               
                    accommodating.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Glass Hill is the pit of hell.                       
                    Underfunded and short staffed. For
                    years he has been kept here to be
                    studied. I suppose the state has
                    lost interest in discovering
                    anything further.
                         
                                             AARON
                    Well... That's why we're here.
                         
                                             DANA
                    Do you mind if I record this?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN

                    Why not?
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
                         
          A loud BUZZER as the door shuts. Sartain escorts Aaron and
          Dana down a hall. Disturbed faces of PATIENTS pass. Many
          behind bars, others with CLINICAL ESCORTS. Dana records
          Sartain as they walk.
                         
                                             DANA
                    How long have you been working with
                    him?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    I've examined every case file
                    written on him. I was a scholar of
                    Dr. Loomis before he passed away.
                    Then I lobbied the University of
                    Illinois to be assign to Michael                     
                    myself.
                                                          3.
                         
                         
                                             DANA
                    Any progress?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    He has been seen by over 50
                    clinical psychiatrists. And with
                    each, many different opinions.
                    Loomis reasoned that he was nothing
                    more than pure evil.
                         
                                             DANA
                    Any you agree with this diagnosis?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Evil is not a diagnosis. Under my
                    care, we implemented a holistic
                    form of therapy. Since that time,
                    his tendency for violence has
                    essentially been erased.
                         
                                             AARON
                    His response to your specific
                    treatment has been effective?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    We left two kitty cats in his cell
                    overnight and both remained
                    unharmed.
                                       (A SMILE)
                    I hate to disappoint you.
                         
          Aaron stop walking.
                         
                                             AARON
                    So you're telling us that there is
                    no similarity between the murderous
                    maniac that made newspaper
                    headlines in 1978 and the amenable
                    patient of this institution?                
                         
          Sartain laughs.
                         
                               DR. SARTAIN
                    Michael Myers is an evolving, aging
                    creature like we all are. And
                    although we have worked very
                    closely with him, these halls
                    display the limitations of my
                    analysis. Loomis saw Michael as a           
                    beast in the wild. He witnessed
                    human behavior at its most primal,
                    while the rest of us only have the
                    opportunity of observation in
                    captivity.
                                                                   4.
                         
                         
          Sartain uses a key to open a heavy door that leads into...
                         
                         
          EXT. COURTYARD. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
                         
          Sartain walks them into an outside courtyard. A few
          DISFIGURED or DISABLED RESIDENTS roam about.                    
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Our patients get fresh air and
                    sunshine, a view, proper exercise,
                    a healthy diet. It pains me to see                    
                    him transferred to a less than                        
                    desirable' facility.
                                       (POINTING)
                    There he is. He can speak. He
                    just chooses not to.
                         
          Aaron and Dana look. WE FIND THE SHAPE OF A MAN sixty feet
          away standing shackled to the ground in the middle of the
          concrete yard. A YELLOW PAINTED SQUARE creates a twenty foot
          frame around him. Tall, strong, aged, dressed in white.
                         
          TWO SECURITY OFFICERS stand watch. SIX OTHER PATIENTS stand
          scattered through the yard.
                         
                                             AARON
                    I'd love to stand near him and get
                    a sense of his awareness... Or lack
                    of awareness.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Make no mistake. He is aware. He
                    was watching you as you arrived.
                    When he's not out here in the
                    courtyard, he walks from this
                    window to that window, to the
                    other. Observing things.
                         
          Aaron and Dana look curiously to each other.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
                                       (TO AARON)
                    And perhaps you'd like to tie your
                    left shoelace. Mr Tovoli, the
                    gentleman with the umbrella, has a
                    fixation for such things.
                    Underestimate no one.
                         
          A patient holding AN UMBRELLA in the sunshine bites a
          fingernail and smiles at them. Embarrassed, Aaron bends down
          to tie his clean white sneaker.
                                                                    5.
                         
                         
                               DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
                     Step up to the yellow line. No
                     further. Do not pass the line under
                     any circumstance.
                         
          Sartain looks to the security guards for reassurance and then
          walks Aaron and Dana to the yellow line on the concrete.
                         
          The Shape stands with his back to them. Sartain calls out:
                         
                               DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
                     Michael. I have some people who
                     would like to meet you.
                         
          Aaron clears his throat.
                         
                                              AARON
                     Michael. My name be Aaron. I've
                     followed your case for years, and I
                     still know very little about you. I
                     want to know more about that night.                   
                     About those involved.
                         
          The Shape is motionless.
                         
                                              AARON (CONT'D)
                     Do you think of them? Feel guilt
                     about their fate?
                         
          Nothing.
                         
          Aaron looks back to Dana with a shrug.   She hesitantly steps    
          forward to join her partner.
                         
                                              AARON (CONT'D)
                     Do you remember Laurie Strode?
                         
          The Shape stretches his fingers and then rests his hand at
          his side. Sartain notices.
                         
                                              AARON (CONT'D)
                     Does she remind you of your sister,
                     Michael? Is that why you chose
                     her?
                         
          The Shape half turns, as if he's going to respond... but then
          doesn't.
                         
          Aaron looks back to Sartain. He nods to Aaron to go ahead.
          Aaron looks to Dana. She unzips her bag.                         
                                                                      6.
                         
                         
                                             AARON (CONT'D)
                    I borrowed something from a friend
                    at the Attorney General's office.
                    Something I'd like you to see.
                         
          Aaron's hand goes inside Dana's shoulder bag and pulls out a
          portion of a WHITE HALLOWEEN MASK. Familiar.
                         
          Sartain looks to see this exchange. Aaron holds the mask out
          before him. The Shape makes no movement. The other patients       
          become restless. Pacing madly. Dana looks around, concerned.      
          Aaron doesn't lower the mask.
                         
                                             AARON (CONT'D)
                    You recognize this, don't you,
                    Michael? How does it make you feel?
                    Say something.
                         
          A few of the patients start screaming. Testing their
          restraints like rabid animals.
                         
          Dana looks to Sartain. He is concerned.
                         
          More patients join in, stomping and screaming, getting louder
          and louder.
                         
          Aaron shouts back to The Shape.                                   
                         
                                             AARON (CONT'D)
                    Say SOMETHING!
                         
          The courtyard has been worked into a frenzied chorus of
          madness, but The Shape remains still.

          INT. CLOSET. NELSON HOUSE. EARLY MORNING.
                         
          CAMERA inside a closet with thin wooden slats. A beautiful
          girl, ALLYSON NELSON (17), appears as the door opens. Her
          face has a soft innocent quality. Eyes are bright and alive.
                         
          She pulls the closet light switch string. The LIGHT BULB
          flickers but doesn't turn on. She pulls the switch again;
          nothing.
                         
          She rummage through the shirts and picks out a workout
          jacket, closing the closet door behind her.
                                                                      7.
                         
                         
          INT. ALLYSON'S BEDROOM. NELSON HOUSE. MORNING.
                         
          Allyson makes her bed. The decor of her room is that of a
          young woman with artifacts of childhood lingering.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. SUNRISE.
                         
          Allyson goes for a jog.                                           
                         
                         
          EXT. BEND IN ROAD. NEIGHBORHOOD. MORNING.
                         
          Allyson jogs past a chain link fence in front of a house. A       
          DOG BARKS ferociously. A little startled, she takes a deep
          breath and continues down the street.
                         
                         
          EXT. COMMUNITY GARDEN. MORNING.
                         
          Allyson jogs by a residential community garden. Flowers,
          vegetables, etc. Much of it dead. A BANGLADESHI WOMAN wraps a
          plant to protect it from the weather of the off season.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN. NELSON HOUSE. MORNING.
                         
          RAY NELSON, 45, opens up a kitchen cabinet and sets a mouse
          trap with peanut butter.
                         
                                             RAY
                    You see this? I switched from
                    marshmallow fluff to peanut butter.
                    We'll see if the little devil
                    snatches it.
                         
          SHANAH NELSON, 38, makes breakfast. She lives life. The
          beauty and heart behind her eyes is hidden.                       
                         
          Allyson enters trying to fix a broken zipper on her school
          bag. The traffic plays on a radio with lighthearted DISC
          JOCKEYS. Competing with that, a television is on with an
          INFOMERCIAL.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    I rescheduled my last session, so
                    I'll be able to make it tonight.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    You didn't have to do that. It's
                    not that big of a deal.                                 
                                                                   8.

                    Of course it is. You got into
                    National Honor Society. It's a very
                    big deal.

                    I was top of my shop class, made
                    ashtrays and birdhouses.
                         
          Ray loads up another mouse trap.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    And I'm looking forward to meeting
                    Cameron.
                         
                                             RAY
                    I know his father Lonnie and his
                    uncle James. The entire Elam family                   
                    has a... reputation.

                    Ray, c'mon.
                         
                                             RAY
                    What?! You know about his
                    situation, right? It's a relevant
                    factor. The whole household is--
                         
          The mouse trap snaps in Ray's hand, smashing his finger. Ray    
          jumps, startled. His finger bleeds.
                         
                                             RAY (CONT'D)
                    Goddamn it!

                    That's not fair, dad. Cameron isn't                   
                    like that. He's a nice guy
                         
          Ray walks to the sink to wash his finger.
                         
                                             RAY
                    I'm not saying he's not nice. It's
                    just- You're too smart to go out
                    with troublemakers and dip shits.
                         
                                              ALLYSON
                    You're right.

                    Did you guys invite Grandmother
                    like you said you would?
                         
          Shanah looks to Ray. They make eyes.
                                                                    9.

                    I did. Talked to her yesterday.
                    She's not going to be able to make
                    it.
                         
          Allyson zips up her back-pack and give her mom a look.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Really?
                         
          Ray kisses his hurt finger and gives Shanah a nervous look.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    She's agoraphobic. In serious need
                    of cognitive... Um... behavioral-
                         
          A buzzer RINGS.

          DAVE (17) takes a hit off a joint and blows smoke through the
          top. It billows through the eyes. Dave get a coughing fit and
          hustles to keep up with his friends.
                         
          VICKY (17) walks in front of him. She's an outspoken
          intellectual. Doesn't take any shit. Allyson walk with them.

                    My mom is a liar. She told me she
                    invited my Grandmother tonight but
                    she didn't.

          Your grandmother is Laurie Strode.
          If I were her I wouldn't celebrate           
          either. I'd put up a Christmas tree
          instead. Just skip over all the

          Jumping to Thanksgiving would make
          sense. Puritans, cornucopias,
          plagues, starvations, slaughtering
          the Indians. That stuff isn't
          creepy at all.

          Pretty much all she talks about. It
          defines her life. She's been in
          shock ever since. You should see
          her house.

          No. I think people made up the bit
          about them being related because it
          made them feel better. Like it
          couldn't happen to anyone.

                    was almost fucking murdered, Dave!
                         
                                             DAVE
                    And she escaped! And he was caught!
                    He's like super incarcerated right
                    now. It's not like the worst thing
                    that has happened to a person. By
                    today's standards.

                    Shut up, Dave. Stop talking.                           
                         
                                             DAVE
                    I'm sorry. I sensed myself going on
                    a rant and didn't know how to
                    eject. Sorry.
                         
          He sees another jack-o-lantern in front of a house.

                    Go for it.
                         
          Dave lights A firecracker, stuffs it into the jack-o-lantern     
          and plants it on the sidewalk. It starts to sizzle.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    Wooooo! happy Halloween!
                         
          It EXPLODES as they run away.

          GROUPED SHOTS strike WITH PRECISION in THE HEART OF A TARGET.
                         
          Holding a smoking gun, years of anxiety cut through a            
          beautiful face. The dark circles under the eyes show a life
          filled with lidless nights. This is LAURIE STRODE (57), for      
          better or worse.
                         
          She's surrounded by wilderness except for the sack with          
          barrels and targets and department store mannequins.
                                                                  12.
                         
                         
          She sets the gun down, pulls a bottle of pills out of her
          pocket and taps one into her mug of coffee. She drinks, wipes    
          her mouth, picks up a different gun. A high power semi-
          automatic weapon.
                         
          She fires at the staged mannequins. Their heads and bodies
          erupt into shrapnel.

          Laurie drives an ATV. It rolls to the farm house with a flat
          tire. She comes to a stop to examine the issue.
                         
          We notice that the downstairs windows have bars covering up
          the glass for security. Wind chimes give a tranquil feel to      
          the fortified compound.

          firearms like a pro. She wears a tank top that reveals a scar
          across her shoulder.

                    To see the animal inside its
                    environment. I fear there has been
                    no rehabilitation. In this case it
                    seems one monster created another.
                    A victim locks herself away.
                    Imprisoned by her own fear. Our
                    goal is to get them in a room
                    together. Can we find a form of
                    rehabilitation if she faces him
                    again?

          Aaron and Dana stop the car and look to an intercom next to
          an overflowing mail box.

                    Journalists don't pay for
                    interviews, Dana. This is her
                    fifteen minutes of fame. There are
                    two people in this world that care
                    about her and they're both in this
                    car.

                    She's financially unstable. Had

                    last forty years from catering to
                    cosmetology. Currently unemployed.

          Dirty dishes are overflowing in the kitchen. The rest of her
          home isn't much better. Books and supplies stacked every
          where.
                         
          Laurie cleans a Smith and Wesson revolver. She opens the
          cylinder and see a SINGLE fastball inside. She takes out the
          bullet and considers it. She puts it back and spins the
          cylinder. Engaged. She cocks the hammer.                        
                         
          A BUZZ startles her. Laurie eyeballs four black and white
          security camera monitors. She looks to the arrival of her
          uninvited guests.

          Aaron struggles to reach the "press to speak" button. It's
          too far so he opens his door just a bit.

                    Aaron and I have made several award
                    winning public radio exposes. Our
                    last project shed fresh light on a
                    murder case from twenty years ago.
                    We like to re-examine incidents
                    with an unbiased lens. When people
                    are willing to face a thing in a
                    different light over time, new
                    truths can sometimes emerge. I
                    believe there is a lot to learn
                    from the horror you experienced.

                    Nothing to learn from something
                    that happened forty years ago.

                    Michael Myers is a human being that
                    killed his sister when he was six
                    years old. And then he came after                   
                    you... We want to know why. We want

                    It's interesting that Michael
                    killed five people and he's a human
                    being. I'm twice divorced and I'm a

                    blemished memories of that night.

                    came to take your daughter away.
                    She was twelve years old. They said
                    you were unfit mother. How long
                    until you regained custody?

          Laurie looks out the front door window to the outside.

                    fashioned than they are. Just don't
                    make them like you too much. I like

          COMMUNITY MEMBERS play basketball as kids from Shanah's

          Shanah takes a final sip off coffee and glances up. Not

                    I specifically told you you're not
                    to have any communication with her.

                    I can't control who calls me.
                    She's her own person and she's
                    making her own decisions.

                    Interesting. I guess she hasn't
                    picked up on the fact that you...
                    raised me.

                    I raised you the way I did for your
                    own protection and you're telling
                    me I ruined your life?

          Laurie appears, holding the yo-yo the kid was trying to          
          untangle. She untangles it to deflect herself from the
          issues.

                    Michael Myers is leaving Smith
                    Grove. I've spent years petitioning
                    for his transfer. He'll spend the
                    rest of his life at a prison in
                    Colorado. I'm going to do what I
                    can to put my past behind me. It's
                    been forty years. I just wanted to
                    come here today and tell you that.
                         
          She takes a moment in attempt to connect.

                    your past behind you, but I've got
                    to figure out if I can put our past
                    behind me.

                    to hear for myself that his vitals
                    no longer function. At that point
                    with the help of a coroner we will
                    extract the brain for our studies
                    and then incinerate the body.                         
                         
          The line of patients walk to a SECURE TRANSPORT BUS where AN

          Sartain sits in the seat behind the driver and observes
          Haskell and Kuneman securing shackles.

          Kuneman walks to Sartain up front. He shuts the metal
          barricade that separates the patients from the guards.

          As Haskell secures Lynch, Lynch starts SCREAMING. Haskell
          hits him in the gut, and settles him back in the seat.

          Kuneman signals the driver. Sartain flick his pen and watches
          The Shape gaze out the window as the bus departs.

                    Destruction is the only solution
                    for Michael. A quiet death before

          As the bus disappears, Laurie has a moment to herself. She
          pulls a bottle of pills out from her purse and takes one.

                                             SHANAH
                    She said she would. She came to my
                    office. We had a nice talk.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Did you really have a talk?
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    I'm being honest with you. We all
                    have to be truthful from now on no
                    matter how much it might hurt us.
                         
                                             RAY
                    Allyson's grandmother has had some
                    struggles, Cameron.                                    
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    We have a lot of addiction in
                    family too. A lot of troubled
                    individuals.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    Can't we have a nice dinner now?
                         
          Ray nods and looks at Cameron who sympathizes.
                         
                                             RAY
                    Cameron, do you know I went to
                    school with your father? He used to
                    sell me Peyote.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Dad!
                                                                  26.
                         
                         
                                             RAY
                    It's true. I learned a lot about
                    myself.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    He, um... He's weird.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    Come on Ray, that's like a massive
                    over-share for our new friend.
                        (changing the subject)
                    Do you have any special All
                    Hallow's Eve plans?
                         
          Allyson looks to Cameron.
                         
                                             SHANAH (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you and Cameron have a
                    little fun tomorrow night. I hear
                    there's a thing at school. What is                     
                    it, a dance or something?
                         
          Shanah and Ray smile knowingly.
                         
                                             SHANAH (CONT'D)
                    Moms talk too.
                         
          Everyone is happy for a moment.
                         
                              LAURIE (O.S.)
                    There you guys are.
                         
          Laurie walks up.   She's a little buzzed, twitchy, sniffling.
                         
                                              SHANAH
                    Mom?
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Hey! I didn't think you were
                    coming.
                         
          Laurie looks to Allyson and winks.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    Wrapped up later than expected.
                         
          Laurie looks to Cameron.
                         
                                             LAURIE (CONT'D)
                    And you must be the new heart
                    throb. What's your name?
                         
          Laurie holds out her hand. Cameron shakes it.
                                                                  27.
                         
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    Cameron Elam. Nice to meet you.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    He's got a firm handshake. Not wet
                    and clammy like Ray's.
                         
                                             RAY
                    Wonderful to see you, Laurie. We're
                    casually getting to know Cameron
                    here and we're having a nice little
                    celebration in honor of Ally-
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    We've all got something to
                    celebrate tonight, don't we? How
                    was the ceremony?                                    
                         
                                              SHANAH
                    It was very nice. Want to have a
                    seat, Mom?
                         
          Laurie notices Allyson's honor award and picks it up.          
                         
                                             SHANAH (CONT'D)
                                       (DISCREET)
                    What are you on?
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Mom!
                         
          Laurie grabs a chair and pulls it up next to their table.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    I'm used to it. I'm a bad mom when
                    I don't show up and a bad mom when
                    I do.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    Stop it. Reset. Let's start over.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    Yes. I agree. Where's the waiter so
                    I can get a drink? I mean if I look
                    the part... Right?
                                       (LOUDLY)
                    Hello? Waiter? Drinks? Does ANYBODY
                    work here?!
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    Stop it. We were just about to get
                    the check actually.
                                                                  28.
                         
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    No we weren't.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    I'm sure Cameron could use a stiff
                    one.
                         
          She looks at him. He looks nervous.
                         
                                             LAURIE (CONT'D)
                    Ray been throwing you the 3rd
                    degree about your family? Have you
                    slept with my granddaughter yet,
                    son?
                         
          Cameron is speechless.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    Mom!
                         
                                             RAY
                    That's enough!
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    Jesus, I'm just kidding. Anyway,
                    where is this waiter??
                         
          Laurie stands to get service just as the waiter is walking       
          past with a TRAY OF FOOD. Laurie's head lifts right into the     
          tray sending glasses and plates SHATTERING LOUDLY.
                         
          Everyone in the restaurant looks. Allyson's eyes fill with
          tears of embarrassment.
                         
          Laurie continues walking out the door. Allyson turns her head
          to see her grandmother walks toward the busy street and stop
          just before getting hit by cars. Horns blare.
                         
          Allyson runs out. She carefully crosses to join her
          grandmother and they share an embrace.
                         
          PRE-LAP: The sound of RADIO static blasts.
                         
                         
          INT. BRONCO (MOVING). NIGHT.
                         
          A FATHER (40's) drives with his college FOOTBALL RANTING SON
          (14) in the passenger seat. Father fiddles with the radio.
                         
                                             FATHER
                    I can't reception on this thing
                    ever since the antenna was bent at
                    the car wash.
                                                                  29.
                         
                         
                                             SON
                    Imagine if they had won last week.
                    They got hit with the 18th-ranked
                    offense, but they totally got wrong
                    ball protection. They had season-                     
                    worst marks of negative-eight                         
                    rushing yards, 295 total yards and
                    five turnovers. Randall scored
                    twenty-eight points off those
                    takeaways, including 21 in the
                    decisive second half.
                         
          Father turns off the radio in frustration.
                         
                                             FATHER
                    Dammit! Can't we just listen to the
                    silence?
                         
                                             SON
                    Dad, look out!
                         
          The Father HARD breaks the truck, skidding to a stop.           
                         
          REVEAL: a MAN WITH A HAUNTED FACE IN A PATIENT'S gown           
          standing in the middle of the road looking at them.
                         
                                             FATHER
                    What the hell happened to you,
                    Hoss?
                         
                                             SON
                    Oh shit, dad. Look.
                         
          The Father turns to his left and sees SEVERAL WANDERING
          PATIENTS on the side of the road. The TRANSPORT bus is just
          off the road near a thicket of trees. EMERGENCY LIGHTS
          BLINKING in the darkness.
                         
                                             FATHER
                    Stay here Lumpy. I'll check it out.                   
                         
          The Father grabs a mag LIGHT from the glove-box and a rifle
          from his gun rack and exits.
                         
                              FATHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Hey! You okay? You fellas all
                    right? Want some help out here?
                         
          The Son calls 911. The HAUNTED PATIENT wanders away. Another    
          one slap the glass of his window and smiles. The Son shakes
          his head `no'.
                                                                   30.
                         
                         
                                             SON
                                       (INTO PHONE)
                    Yes? Hello? Yes. There's been an
                    accident or something... There's a
                    bus. People running around in the
                    road... Lemme check.
                         
          The Son looks out the window where he sees a mile marker.
                         
                                             SON (CONT'D)
                    Yeah. Looks like mile 227. - Yes.
                    That back road just past Old
                    Willard_Bridge. -- My dad went to                      
                    look. I don't know-- Hold on. I'll
                    go check...
                         
          The Son opens his door. He gets out. All is silent.
                         
                                                SON (CONT'D)
                    Dad?
                         
          The patients are gone. No sign of his father.
                         
          He reaches back in the truck and grabs the second rifle. He
          walks across the tall grass of the empty field toward the
          bus.
                         
          Suddenly an ARM reaches OUT OF THE GRASS and grabs the boy by
          the ankle. The boy gasps. He looks down to see a near
          lifeless Kuneman with his arm outstretched.
                         
                                                KUNEMAN
                    Help.
                         
          The boy looks at the bloody victim lying in the grass.
                         
                                             SON
                    The police are on their way. What
                    happened? Where's my dad?
                         
          Kuneman gnarls something and spits blood.                        
                         
                                             SON (CONT'D)
                    I can't understand.                                    
                         
          Kuneman spits more blood.                                        
                         
                                             SON (CONT'D)
                    Wait there. I'll get my dad.
                         
                                                KUNEMAN
                    No. Run...
                         
          Kuneman passes out. The boy looks around, aiming his gun.
                                                                    31.

                    Dad? Daddy?!
                         
          He takes aim and steps toward the open door of the bus and
          sees the dead driver. He steps onto the bus and looks to the
          back. Suddenly, Sartain rises from under a seat.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Don't shoot.
                         
          BLAM! Without hesitation, the kid shoots Sartain in the
          shoulder. Sartain falls.
                         
                                               SON
                    Aw ffff-!
                         
          The kid panics and sprints back to the truck. He climbs in
          the driver's seat, turns the key in the ignition.
                         
          From behind him, The Shape appear inside the truck, grabs him
          by the throat and attacks.

          Shanah consoles an upset Allyson as Cameron and Ray walk away
          from Laurie's truck. She drives away.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    You need to know this. I was raised
                    to trust no one. Our house was a
                    bunker and I lived on lockdown my
                    entire childhood. We'd hide in the
                    basement every time the paranoia
                    set in. I still have nightmares
                    about that room. She didn't let me
                    go to school. Instead she trained
                    me to shoot and fight until social
                    services came and took me away. I
                    chose to forget the neurosis she
                    planted in my head.
                         
          Ray approaches and hands Allyson the orange envelope that
          Aaron gave Laurie.
                         
                                             RAY
                    She told me to give you this.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    What is it?
                         
          Allyson turns away and looks inside the envelope and sees the
          cash, then looks to Cameron who stands near.
                                                                  32.

                    It's like she's spent her entire
                    adult life preparing for the past.
                    She lives every day in fear he's
                    coming back.
                         
          Ray gives his wife a supportive kiss on the forehead.

          REVEAL OFFICER FRANK HAWKINS (63), a uniformed police officer
          in full command of his evening's amusement. This is an
          aggressive game at a corner convenience store.
                         
          COREY and STANFORD stand beside coaching his moves.
                         
          SHAMEEL, an employee, fills up drinks at the slushy fountain
          nearby.
                         
                                             SHAMEEL
                    Yo Hawkins, you want that
                    strawberry slushy or blue raspberry
                    slushy?
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    I'm in wizard mode, Shameel. Get me
                    a coffee if you don't mind. Thanks.
                    I'll get you back.
                         
          Hawkins gets frustrated and slaps the machine.

                    If the ball comes down loose, don't
                    hit that bounce pass. It's gonna
                    hit off that broken flipper then
                    whack the bottom of the slingshot
                    and go down the middle.
                         
          A new ball emerges as Hawkins' radio squawks.

          Officer Hawkins pulls up to the site of the transport bus.       
          Hawkins gets out of his squad car. He has a strong, confident
          build, but warily approaches. The patients are gone.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Sheriff's Department! If you need
                    assistance, please let yourself be
                    known!
                         
          Hawkins looks and sees Kuneman dead on the side of the road.
          He speaks into his radio.
                         
                              OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                    Signal 13. I have an officer down.
                    Officer down. I need assistance.
                    Send back-up right away.
                         
          He reaches back into his car and pulls out a scatter gun with
          a Surefire Weapon-light. He approaches the scene. Sees
          something near the back end of the bus that catches his eye.
                         
          There is a figure sitting in the glare of the blinking red
          light, looking upward.
                         
          Hawkins shines his light onto the figure. It doesn't move.
                         
          Hawkins sees that it's THE FATHER, dead, sitting with his
          head tilted too far back, mouth agape. He shines the beam on     
          the Father's neck and sees the BUMPY bone pushing up on the
          neck underneath, snapped.                                        
                         
          Hawkins turns to see the Son, dead in a pool of blood . He
          kneels next to the boy to check for a pulse. None.
                         
          He hears a voice FROM INSIDE THE BUS. The back door is open.
                         
          Hawkins climbs up and sees: DR. SARTAIN, shell shocked in the
          aisle bleeding from the gunshot.
                         
                              OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                    Show your hands!!
                                                                    34.

                                       (WEAK)
                    I can't.
                         
          With his gun light, Hawkins sees that Sartain is chained to a
          seat. He climbs onto the bus. Sartain heaves for breath.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Sir. Help is coming. Stay with me!
                         
          Sartain looks up at the Officer, his eyes wild and open.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Did he... Did he escape?

                    Who? Did who escape?                                   
                         
          Sartain softly closes his eyes as we HEAR SIRENS in the
          distance...

          Dana takes a shower. Through the steam of the hot water, she
          rinses her hair and closes her eyes. We watch the water roll     
          down the drain.
                         
          We see the bathroom door open slowly and a figure enters.
                         
          Standing still behind the shower curtain is the body of a man    
          in THE MASK. He stands a beat and then pull the curtain back.

          Dana laughs.
                         
                                             DANA
                    Take that hideous thing off.
                         
          Aaron takes off the mask and puts it on the counter.
                         
                                             AARON
                    When I wear this, there is a
                    certain tendency or inclination
                    that the legacy of the mask seems
                    to inspire.
                                                                    35.
                         
                         
                                             DANA
                    Please don't murder me.

                    I would never. I need your smile.
                         
          Aaron step into the shower and gives Dana a kiss.
                         
          The TV SET in the other room casts a glow.

          Allyson jogs down the sidewalk through her neighborhood.
                         
                         
          EXT. COMMUNITY GARDEN. MORNING.
                         
          Allyson runs by the community garden.
                         
          A HANDHELD CAMERA implies an OBSERVER from behind some
          standing plants.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. MORNING.
                         
          As Allyson jogs on, she notices A FEW PEOPLE congregating by
          a LARGE TREE. They're looking at something.
                         
                                             ONLOOKER #1
                    Who in the hell would do this?
                         
                                             ONLOOKER #2
                    It's awful.
                         
          Allyson joins everyone looking UP at something horrible -- a
          DEAD DOG hung by his neck from a tree branch. The same heel
          that barked at her the day before.
                         
          Allyson is visibly upset.
                         
          A neighbor reaches up to touch it.
                         
          Allyson notices a vehicle down the street. It's the familiar
          BRONCO.
                         
          Behind her, the onlookers struggle to get the dog down.

          Laurie awakens in her truck. Tired after a tough night. She      
          looks at herself in the rearview mirror.
                                                                   36.

                    Police have not determined the
                    cause of the accident, but we do
                    know there are multiple fatalities.
                         
          Laurie turns to look at the TV.

                    According to sources, authorities
                    have sent personnel from a local
                    state hospital. At this time, we
                    do not know why.
                         
          CLOSE ON: POLICE SCANNER turning on, bolt lock spinning top
          and bottoms of doors. A knife sheath is clicked onto Laurie's    
          belt. The canvas curtains are ZIPPED.
                         
          Laurie walks over to an island in the kitchen. She turns the
          island counter-clockwise to reveal A DOOR in THE FLOOR.
                         
          She opens the door and looks into the darkness of a storm
          shelter below.
                         
          She climbs down a ladder and slips into the shelter.
                         
          A LIGHT flicks on. The door shuts behind her
                         
                         
          EXT. MT. SINCLAIR CEMETERY. DAY.
                         
          Creeping through the tall brown grass, we find Aaron and Dana
          walking through expansive rows of crooked tombstones. They
          walk with the CARETAKER, who lead them.

                    My cousin works at a graveyard not
                    too far from here. They got War
                    Generals, Philanthropists, a
                    beatnik poet. They got Muddy Waters                    
                    and Bernie Mac. People come from
                    all over to pay respects. But this
                    gal from Haddonfield. This is our                      
                    only claim to fame.
                         
          They come to a grave and stop. Dana kneel down in front of
          the grave and looks at the name: JUDITH MYERS.
                                                                   37.

                    Maybe you can explain to me what's
                    so spectacular about Judith Myers.
                         
          Dana is in a zone. Transfixed with the history of this
          place, she speaks into her recorder.
                         
                                             DANA
                    ...As she sat combing her hair.
                    Unaware. Her six year old brother
                    crept in quietly with a kitchen
                    knife.
                         
          A look of disgust on the caretaker's face.
                         
                                             CARETAKER
                    Damn.
                         
          Aaron joins in. She hands him the recorder.
                         
                                             AARON
                    He then proceeded to slice the base
                    of her skull down to her spinal                       
                    chord, here...
                        (demonstrates on self)
                    ...then she turned and raised her
                    hands in self-defense. He continued
                    stabbing into the arteries and
                    nerves of her palms, like so...
                        (points to palms)
                    Once she collapsed, three more
                    stabs in her sternum, piercing her                    
                    heart.
                         
          The caretaker looks put off by the vivid story.
                         
                                             CARETAKER
                    I don't know about sternums.   All I
                    know is we've had to replace   this
                    stone two times, people come   around
                    and put demon pentagrams and   voodoo
                    shit on it. Every Halloween.   Crazy
                    coconuts.
                         
          Dana pull out a camera and snaps some picture of the grave.

          Aaron pumps gas at a service station. Dana has her research
          spread out on the back seat of the car. She ponders headlines
          from NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS in her binder.
                         
          Aaron looks up and sees A CHURCH VAN at the pump opposite        
          him. In the back seat is AN ELDERLY WOMAN staring at him out
          her window.
                         
          REVEAL POV: the Old Woman is actually looking BEHIND AARON       
          where she see THE SHAPE step out of the Bronco. A man in
          white patient attire.
                         
          Aaron doesn't see as The Shape walks into the opened garage
          where the Mechanic works.
                         
                                             DANA
                    If we could get those initial
                    police transcripts from the press                      
                    conference and post-conviction
                    proceedings we might have a great
                    prologue for our story.
                         
          Dana gets out of the car and goes to Aaron.

          Dana heads inside. She walks past an open garage where a
          MECHANIC in a JUMPSUIT works to put a tire on to a wheel.
                         
          Aaron sees the Old Woman still staring.
                         
          The Old Woman's DAUGHTER AND GRANDSON get in the van.
                         
          Aaron watches them drive off.

          She goes to the bathroom at the side of the station.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM. SERVICE STATION. DAY.
                         
          Dana takes a paper towel from the dispenser   and walks toward
          the stalls. She uses the tissue to push the   first door open.
          She grimaces and heads to the second stall.   Not much better.
          She continues to the third stall and pushes   the door open.
          It's acceptable.
                         
          She enters the stall, places the paper towel on the bowl,
          pulls down her pants and sits down.
                         
          As Dana sits on the toilet, she sees graffiti scrawled on the
          stalls: "Amazing grace come sit on my face. Don't make me
          cry, I need your... pie"
                         
          She pulls out a pencil, scratches out "pie" and changes it to
          "smile".
                         
          She chuckles to herself as she hears the sound of the
          bathroom DOOR OPENING.
                         
          FOOTSTEPS walk on the tile floor.
                         
          SLAM-- the first stall door opens.
                         
          Dana flinches, hears: BREATHING.
                         
          The footsteps move closer-- SLAM. The second stall door
          opens.
                         
                         
          EXT. SERVICE STATION. DAY.
                         
          At the pumps, Aaron sees a handwritten sign that says,
          "Please pay inside".
                         
          He walks to the check-out and sees that the Mechanic has had
          his jaw broken and his TEETH KNOCKED OUT. His uniform has
          been removed.
                         
                                             AARON
                    Dana?!
                         
          Aaron cautiously steps into the garage. He looks past a truck
          with the hood open and sees the LEGS of the ANOTHER MECHANIC
          protruding out of an office door.
                         
          Aaron grabs a crow bar off the workbench.
                                                                   40.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM. SERVICE STATION. DAY.
                         
          Dana stares at a pair of DIRTY BOOTS outside her stall door.
                         
          The Shape, wearing a MECHANIC'S JUMPSUIT.
                         
                                             DANA
                    Excuse me. Someone's in here.
                         
          She watches as a hand REACHES OVER THE DOOR AND A DOZEN
          BLOODY, RIPPED OUT TEETH DROP AND SCATTER ONTO THE FLOOR.
                         
          She looks up--
                         
          TWO HANDS grab the top of the stall door. The hands begin
          using force to PULL and PUSH the door.
                         
          She can hear the metal distort under pressure.
                         
          She pulls her pants back on and slides to the ground,
          scrambles to crawl underneath into the succeeding stall...
                         
          Dana crawls on her stomach as the stall door is ripped open
          behind her. As she lies underneath she GETS PULLED BACKWARDS.
                         
          She struggles to hold onto the stall divider.
                         
          TWO HANDS GRIP HER ANKLES.
                         
          She kicks as hard as she can. Her kick frees her. She
          quickly jumps up and shuts the stall door. LOCKS IT.
                         
          The Shape BANGS on THE DOOR.
                         
          Beyond The Shape's feet, DANA SEES THE BATHROOM DOOR SWING
                         OPEN--
                         
          Aaron's WHITE SNEAKERS STEP IN. One of the sneaker laces
          UNTIED.
                         
                                             DANA (CONT'D)
                    Aaron?!
                         
                                             AARON
                    Oh bollocks.
                         
          She hears a crowbar whack the Shape THREE SWIFT TIMES.
                         
                                             AARON (CONT'D)
                    DOWN! DOWN! DOWN!
                         
                                             DANA
                    NO!!!
                                                                    41.
                         
                         
          Foot entangled, The Shape struggles with Aaron.
                         
          She hears Aaron being choked.
                         
          A crowbar CLANGS on the tiles.
                         
          Just within reach, she grabs the crowbar and pulls it back.
                         
          She looks over as Aaron is slammed into the stall door.          
                         
          She sees THE SHAPE'S FOOT and drives the crowbar into his
          boot.
                         
                                              DANA (CONT'D)
                                   AARON--
                         
                                             AARON
                                       (WHISPERS)
                    What have we done.
                         
          Aaron is yanked away. She sees Aaron's sneakers pull up out
          of view.
                         
          The Shape drags Aaron. A loud crash and SHATTERED mirror         
          rains on the tile floor.
                         
                                              DANA
                    Aaron!!!
                         
          We hear a violent POUND POUND POUND on the stall door; it's
          The Shape using Aaron's body as a battering ram.
                         
          Dana screams-- BOOM-- the door flies opens, knocking the crow
          bar out of her hand.
                         
          The Shape throws Aaron and we follow him as he lands in a
          corner by the trash can. His head hits hard on the tile
          floor. His open eyes face us. Aaron is bloody and twitching
          in pain.
                         
          The Shape is in the stall with Dana. She is yanked up. We
          only see her head gripped by The Shape. Struggling as he
          chokes her.
                         
          Aaron is useless on the ground. He's alive, his fingers          
          reaching out as Dana goes lifeless.                              
                         
                         
          INT. SERVICE STATION. DAY.
                         
          The Cashier lays across the counter. On the transistor radio     
          next to him we hear the local news do a spooky All Hallow's
          Eve version of the weather report.
                                                                   42.
                         
                         
          Looking outside the shop window, we see The Shape digging        
          deep down in the trunk of Aaron's car at the pump.
                         
                         
          EXT. SERVICE STATION. DAY.
                         
          From INSIDE THE RENTAL CAR WE SEE the research binder.
                         
          TILT UP TO SEE: The Shape as he picks up HIS MASK and puts it    
          on. It's an eerie sight to behold.
                         
          He BREATHES.
                         
                         
          INT. ROOM. HOSPITAL. DAY.
                         
          Dr. Sartain lies in bed with his eyes closed, bandages around
          his shoulder.
                         
          Officer Hawkins stands at his bedside.
                         
          SHERIFF BARKER (60's) enters with two coffees.
                         
                                             SHERIFF BARKER
                    Still waiting to ID the patients we
                    found to see who's who. Almost all
                    accounted for. Found two of them
                    trying to check their e-mail at the
                    local library and three others
                    holding hands and chasing
                    butterflies by the flea market off
                    220. Any word from Rip van Winkle
                    over there?
                         
          The Sheriff sip his coffee.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Not yet. The nurses say he's been
                    in and out. Lost a lot of blood.
                    Somehow managed to fall on a
                    bullet. I'm trying to get the
                    story. Because here's my concern:
                    Take a look at this list.
                         
          Hawkins hands him the list. Sheriff scans it.                    
                         
                              OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                    Most of the passengers were minor
                    offenders. Mental patients.
                         
          CLOSE on LIST. Sheriff's thumb glides over names.
                         
                              OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                    One stuck out. A-2201.
                                                                 43.
                         
                         
          CLOSE ON LIST. Sheriff's thumb glides back up, land on "A-
          220. Myers, Michael"
                         
                              OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                    Michael Myers. The Babysitter
                    Murders, 1978. It's forty years to
                    the day. You think this is a
                    coincidence or part of some greater
                    plan?
                         
          The Sheriff looks at Sartain laying there.
                         
                                             SHERIFF BARKER
                    Look Frank, I don't need to incite
                    panic until we have all the facts.
                    Myers loose with a bunch of nutbags
                    in Haddonfield on Halloween night
                    is a fucking joke if it's not
                    legit. It sounds like a joke. It
                    would ruin our department. And if
                    it is legit. If Myers did escape,
                    we're gonna have a serious circus
                    on our hands.
                         
          Hawkins looks at the Sheriff.
                         
                              SHERIFF BARKER (CONT'D)
                    I mean, what are we gonna do,
                    cancel Halloween?
                         
          The Sheriff laughs.
                         
                                             HAWKINS
                    There's a reason we're supposed to
                    be afraid of this night.
                         
          Hawkins' radio squawks.

          End of the school day. Various COSTUMED CHEERLEADERS drive
          by. They are piled in a convertible and honk the horn.
                         
          Vicky and Ally walk with Dave. Dave carries Vicky's back
          pack.

                    So, bad news. I can't go to the
                    dance tonight.
                                                          44.

                    I got a call to baby-sit. They               
                    needed somebody at the last minute.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    I get it. You didn't let up about
                    me going and then you back out?
                         
                                             VICKY
                    It's good for you to go. You're
                    going out with Cameron now. You'll
                    hang with his friends. It's his
                    scene. You can't just use homework
                    as an excuse, can you? Can you?!
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Maybe I like doing- I'm not being
                    anti-social. I'm just... reserved.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    You're sheepish, only like in a              
                    very fresh way.
                         
          They get to Vicky's car.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    Look, I wouldn't bail on you, but I
                    need some cash, so I said I would.
                    You'll have fun. I promise.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    Vicky's also gonna have some fun.
                    She said if I behave, I can come
                    over after the kid's nighty night
                    and do cool stuff. Like clean
                    dishes, mop up, keep her company.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    You're like my helpful pet. I
                    appreciate you, Dave. If you help
                    me mop and do dishes I'll take your
                    virginity. Enough of this third
                    base shit, right? We're adults.
                         
          She takes her back pack from him.

                    tattoos so we can remember this day
                    forever?
                                                                  45.
                         
                         
          Vicky laughs. Allyson turn and sees Oscar and Cameron walking
          across the parking lot.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Hey, there's Cameron. I'm gonna
                    catch up with him. You guys go on
                    without me.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    Okay, if not you're pissed at me.
                    Are you pissed?
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    No. I just thought... It'd be more
                    fun if you'd hang with me. That's
                    all. Cameron is sweet, but I'm
                    still getting used to the idea... I
                    don't know. And his friend...?
                         
                                                                  CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. PARKING LOT. CONTINUOUS.
                         
          Oscar and Cameron walk across the parking lot.
                         
                                             OSCAR
                    There she is, brother. What do you                     
                    say? She's a knock out. I would
                    definitely take her over me any day
                    of the week. I'm not offended.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    I like her. I'm serious. And I
                    don't want you to fuck this up by
                    doing something stupid. Please.
                         
          Allyson walks up. Oscar sees the CHEERLEADERS drive by again
          on the other side of the lot.
                         
                                             OSCAR
                    Hey Allyson. Guess what? Cameron                       
                    likes you more than me, but I'm
                    over it. I'll see you guys later.
                    I'm gonna catch up with Bianca and                     
                    see if any of those ladies need a
                    handsome male escort to Halloween.
                         
          Cameron and Allyson shrug and Oscar races off on a mission.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    He's a mess.
                        (turns to Allyson)
                    You okay?
                                                                  46.
                         
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    I'm fine. I couldn't sleep. I was
                    so embarrassed about last night.
                    I'm sorry you had to see that. It's
                    a weird time for me I guess.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    Wait till you meet my family. Your
                    grandma has nothing on my Uncle
                    James. Don't worry about that
                    stuff, okay?
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Okay. I won't worry.
                         
                         
          INT. REST ROOM. SERVICE STATION. DAY
                         
          FLASH-- Hawkins stands in the door to the bathroom. The walls
          covered in blood. He studies the crime scene with the coroner
          as a PHOTOGRAPHER snaps pictures-- FLASH.
                         
                         
          INT. SERVICE STATION. DAY.
                         
          Hawkins observes the dead Cashier as a detective dusts for       
                         PRINTS--
                         
          FLASH. FLASH.
                         
                         
          EXT. SERVICE STATION. DAY.
                         
          Police cars and ambulances are active at the crime scene.
          Lights flashing as OFFICERS try to piece it together.
                         
          Across the way, Laurie appears amongst the ONLOOKERS gathered
          on the other side of the police tape.
                         
          Hawkins sees Laurie across the lot. He turns to a passing
          OFFICER RICHARDS.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Is that who I think it is?
                         
          The cop sees Laurie.
                         
                                             OFFICER RICHARDS
                    Yeah. She calls the station at
                    least twice a month. She's a
                    paranoid pain in the ass.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Tell her to go home.
                                                                  47.
                         
                         
          As Richards approaches Laurie, Hawkins joins the Sheriff. A      
          DETECTIVE in rubber gloves holds up the white hospital
          clothes found on the ground.
                         
                                             DETECTIVE
                    State issued.

                    Get on the phone to Smith's Grove
                    and confirm the match.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    In the meantime, we have to let
                    people know, Sir.
                         
                                             SHERIFF BARKER
                    Not until we have confirmation. I
                    don't want the media foaming at the
                    mouth and dragging the name of this
                    town through the headlines again.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    I strongly disagree, sir. If this
                    is who we think it is, we have one
                    order of business. Hunt this man
                    down.
                         
          Hawkins looks to where Laurie was. She's gone.
                         
                         
          EXT. DRIVEWAY. NELSON HOUSE. LATE DAY.
                         
          Before dark, a few KIDS are trick-or-treating in the streets
          as Shanah pulls up and stops in front of her home.
                         
          Some kid dressed in a costume slaps the hood of her car,
          startles her, and runs off.
                         
          Shanah gets out of the car with a sack of groceries. We watch
          her as she's greeted by a few costumed kids.
                         
                         
          INT. FOYER. NELSON HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          It's dead quiet as Shanah opens her front door and enters the
          home. She sees A LIGHT in the staircase on.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    Ray?
                         
          She leaves the door open behind her as she enters.
                         
                                             SHANAH (CONT'D)
                    Allyson? Anyone home?
                                                                   48.
                         
                         
          She puts the food down on the kitchen counter and notices
          that all of her knives are spread out along the counter as if
          on display.
                         
          She hears something upstairs. A noise that could be the house
          settling or it could be something more.
                         
          She begins walking toward the steps slowly.
                         
          She hears footsteps above her. Someone's in the house.
                         
          Ray appears abruptly in the front door.
                         
                                             RAY
                    Shanah?
                         
          Shanah turns and motions for him to be silent.
                         
          Laurie appears at the top of the stairs holding a PISTOL.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    Bang. You're dead.
                         
          Shanah gasps.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    You scared the shit out of me. What
                    are you doing in my house?!
                         
                                              LAURIE
                    Side window is unlocked. No
                    security system. You have a dozen
                    knives available for any psychotic
                    to come in here and stab you with.
                    Sometimes I can't tell the
                    difference between ignorance and
                    stupidity.
                         
                                             RAY
                    I know Jujitsu, Laurie. I can apply
                    pressure points and choke holds to
                    use the opponents force of attack
                    against them.
                         
                                             SHANAH/LAURIE
                    Shut up, Ray.
                         
          Laurie walks down the stairs.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    Michael has escaped. I'd be a fool
                    to think this is over. If he comes
                    for my family, I'll be ready.
                                                                 49.

                    Where's Allyson? We have to get out
                    of here. Now.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    Mom, no one's coming after you and
                    they're not coming after us. Get
                    out of my way.
                         
          Shanah walks past her to hang up her jacket in the closet.
                         
                                             RAY
                    Maybe you should put down that gun?
                         
          Laurie steps out onto the front porch.

                    'Out of my way'. It's like I'm
                    always in your way, aren't I,
                    Shanah? You're always going
                    somewhere and you're trying to
                    leave me behind. Evil is real. You
                    don't know what it's like to feel
                    true terror. To live powerless. I
                    don't ever want you to feel that
                    way. I only want to train and
                    protect you.

                    The world is not a dark place. It
                    can be full of love and
                    understanding and I don't need your
                    psychotic rants to confuse me or
                    convince me otherwise.

                    You need to leave, Laurie.
                         
          Laurie looks at both of them from the front porch and pauses.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    Do you have a gun?
                         
          Shanah step to the door.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    Of course not.
                         
          She shuts the door in her mom's face.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT.
                         
          KIDS streak down the street collecting candy in costume.
                                                                  50.
                         
                         
          POP! POP! POP! - ANOTHER GROUP OF OLDER KIDS light off noisy
          FIRECRACKERS in the street.
                         
          A kid dressed as a COWBOY WITH A BOOMBOX ON HIS SHOULDER
          stumbles and drops a bag of candy under the shadow of a tree.
          His friends run off as he scoops his candy off the ground.
                         
                                             COWBOY KID
                    Hey wait up!
                         
          From the shadows behind the kid, we see THE SHAPE standing in
          by the tree, BREATHING.                                          
                         
          The Shape steps forward. The kid runs into him, looks up and
          runs off.
                         
                              COWBOY KID (CONT'D)
                    Sorry mister.
                         
          The Shape sees a woman with a flashlight getting a frozen
          chicken out of the deep freeze in her back shed and then
          going back inside, leaving the shed open.                        
                         
          We FOLLOW The Shape through the side yard toward the shed.
          Inside he sees a hammer on a workbench.
                         
          The CAMERA follows The Shape through the back door of the
          house. The room glows from a television. POV into the
          kitchen.
                         
          The woman runs water from the sink over the frozen chicken as
          she cuts a sandwich with a large knife. She passes frame to
          get something. The Shape hears CLATTERING in the kitchen. He
          enters with the hammer in hand and disappears from view. We      
          hear a short struggle and some hard hits and then see the
          woman's body thrown back into frame. Dead. The Shape enters
          once again to observe his bloody kill and grabs her carving
          knife off the counter.
                         
          CAMERA follows The Shape as he turns and walks through the
          kitchen. Through the dinning room. Through the living room
          where an OLD MAN SLEEPS on the couch.
                         
          The Shape walks out the front door to the next HOUSE past a
          few more TRICK OR TREATERS. As he walks, he sees a HUSBAND
          and WIFE get into a car in their costumes, a HUNKY DOCTOR and
          a SEXY NURSE.
                         
                                             HUSBAND
                    Oh hell, I can't find my keys.
                         
                                             WIFE
                    We're going to be late.
                                                                   51.
                         
                         
          The husband runs inside. The Shape watches the wife alone in
          the passenger side of the car. Vulnerable. CRICKETS CHIRP.
                         
          She looks up toward The Shape.
                         
                                             WIFE (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
                         
                                             HUSBAND
                    Let's go, baby.
                         
          The Husband reappears and The Shape steps off as they drive
          away. We follow The Shape as he moves to the next HOUSE...
                         
          Inside, a WOMAN (40), hands candy to trick or treaters. -- A
          PRINCESS, a UNICORN, and AN ALIEN.
                         
                              TRICK OR TREATER
                    Trick or treat!
                         
                                             WOMAN
                    Wow! Look at you, all dressed up.
                         
          She gives them the remainder of the candy in her bowl.
                         
                                             WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    You guys are my last customers for
                    the night. Happy Halloween!
                         
          The trick or treaters walk off and the woman closes the door
          and turns off the porch light.
                         
          POV as we see inside a LIVING ROOM WINDOW. A TELEPHONE RINGS.    
          The woman enters, answers the phone and turn on a LAMP--
                         
          The Shape exits his own POV as our images settles on a view
          through the window.
                         
          The woman inside talks on the phone to someone who has heard
          about the escaped mental patient and lowers the horizontal
          blinds. As she does, The Shape appears behind her. She turns
          and screams. He cuts her throat. She drops dead into our
          frame as blood spills from her neck.
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. PARKING LOT. NIGHT.
                         
          COSTUMED KIDS walk through the parking lot. MUSIC THUMPS
          from the Halloween Dance Party in the gymnasium.
                         
          Allyson and Cameron approach the party in their costumes. In
          a spin on the obvious, Cameron is Bonnie and Allyson is
          Clyde.
                                                                     52.
                         
                         
          Cameron turns away from the crowd. He laughs.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    What's wrong?
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    Nothing. It took me a whole year to
                    get up the nerve to ask you out and
                    now look what I'm willing to do to
                    impress you.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    I know. I respect that. You look
                    good. You look amazing.
                         
          She straighten his wig a little bit.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    So do you. Total criminal.
                         
          A flirtatious look between them. She give him a kiss.
                         
          Oscar rushes up dress as A VAMPIRE WITH SUNGLASSES.               
                         
                                             OSCAR
                    You guys! Daaayum, you look good.
                    Hey, I got a twelve pack stashed
                    and gin in this flask. Who wants to
                    party with Oscar?
                         
          He hands Cameron a flask and pulls him away. Cameron hides
          the flask in his pocket and laughs.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    We're gonna have a good time,
                    right?!
                         
          Allyson smiles at Cameron as he is consumed by the crowd.

          Allyson and Cameron are laughing. Oscar takes pictures with
          an OLD-SCHOOL FLASH CAMERA.
                         
          Allyson looks at her phone. It's Vicky. Cameron notices.
                                                                     53.

                    I'm sad you're not here. It's
                    ridiculous. It's actually a lot
                    easier for me to talk to people
                    when I can't tell who they are.
                         
                              VICKY (O.S.)
                    See. I told you. How's Cameron?
                    Looking hot in my skirt?

                    he's sweet.
                         
          Allyson's phone vibrates. She looks. "Grandmother". She sends
          it to voice mail.

          Julian appears.
                         
                                             JULIAN
                    I heard you telling your friends to
                    come over here and you're drinking
                    beer. That's against the rules. I'm
                    telling my mom.
                         
          He heads back toward the living room. She follows.
                         
                                              VICKY
                    Well, I've seen your browser
                    history, Julian. Wouldn't want me
                    telling your folks about that,
                    would you?
                         
          Panicked, Julian shakes his head `no'.

                    -And up late watching horror movies
                    is not what you're supposed to be
                    doing either.
                         
          She pats his head.

                    Will you leave the door open? Just
                    a crack?
                         
          She leaves the door open a crack to let some light in.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    Goodnight, critter.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Vicky turns on the sink and starts doing dishes. The water is
          loud as she hand-washes a few pots and plates.
                         
          As she washes dishes we move our focus past Vicky out the
          window to a clothes line of sheets gently flapping in the
          breeze.
                                                                  55.
                         
                         
          Something suddenly MOVES BEHIND THE SHEETS-- the sheets whip
          quickly, disturbed.
                         
          Vicky looks up, turning off the faucet. She focuses out the
          window beyond the sheets into the darkness of the backyard...
                         
          Keeping her eye outside, she walks to the door. Suddenly--
                         
          A LOUD BANG on the glass of the door window. Vicky shrieks as
          Dave's smiling face appears.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    Jesus Dave! You scared the shit out
                    of me.
                         
          She unlocks. He's dressed as A FARMHAND with a straw hat. He
          carries a jack-o-lantern with hearts for eyes.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    Sorry. I've been knocking on the
                    front door for five minutes. I
                    didn't wanna ring the bell and wake
                    the kid. Check it out. Fresh from
                    my patch.
                         
          Vicky shakes off her nervousness and laughs.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    Julian just went to bed.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    So we have the house to ourselves?
                         
                                             VICKY
                    Allyson and Cameron are gonna head
                    over in a few.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    Should we make popcorn? Wanna watch
                    TV?
                         
                                             VICKY
                    No.
                         
          Dave and Vicky smile at each other. She leans in for a kiss.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    Hold on a sec. Check this out. I
                    did this for you.
                         
          He pulls back his flannel to reveal the fresh ink and dried
          blood of a new tattoo... `10-31-18' on his right shoulder.
                                                                 56.
                         
                         
                                              DAVE (CONT'D)
                    Because tonight is the night. And
                    this is tonight's date which is
                    Halloween.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    Oh fuck yeah.
                         
                         
          INT. LAURIE'S CAR. NIGHT. (MOVING)
                         
          Driving down the street, Laurie listens to the police
          scanner. She's alert, anxious, looking around. Noticing the
          Trick-or-treaters run by.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Vicky and Dave make out passionately. Dave has his hand up
          her shirt. Vicky tense up.
                         
                                             VICKY
                                       (WHISPERING)
                    Shhh... stop. Dave. What was that?
                         
          Dave stops. He looks around.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    What? What was it?
                         
                                             VICKY
                    I don't know. I heard something.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    It's nothing. It's Julian taking a
                    dump or somethin'. C'mon...
                         
          They hear a door close and she stops him.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    I'm serious. Go see.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    Go see him take a shit?
                         
                                                VICKY
                    Go!
                         
          He composes himself and turns just as Julian appears at the
          bottom of the stairway. The sight of him makes Dave flinch.
                         
                                                DAVE
                    Oh fuck me
                                                                  57.
                         
                         
                                             VICKY
                                       (LAUGHS)
                    Julian?
                         
          Vicky hurries over to him, kneels at his level.
                         
                                             VICKY (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing up?
                         
                                             JULIAN
                    I saw someone in the hallway,
                    standing outside my door.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    Aww, bro! Ghosts and goblins?
                         
                                             JULIAN
                    Shut up, Dave! I heard him
                    breathin' then I saw him. He's in
                    here. The Boogeyman's in the house!
                         
          Vicky ushers Julian out.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    Come on. Let's go see this
                    creature, then get you back to bed.
                         
          She takes Julian out.
                         
          Dave shakes his head. He pulls a joint from his pocket and
          steps outside the kitchen to smoke it. He notices the garage
          has an open door. The light is on. He heads towards it.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          ANGLE DOWN DARK HALLWAY. At the far end we see Vicky and
          Julian standing there. Julian points.
                         
                                             JULIAN
                    He was standing in the door right
                    there. I closed my eyes. When I
                    opened them, he was gone.
                         
          From behind Vicky and Julian's shoulders, we see that
          Julian's door is open.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    That's the last time I show you a
                    scary movie.
                         
          We stay with Julian as Vicky glides into the hall sliding on    
          her SOCKS. She sock-skates into his bedroom.
                                                                 58.
                         
                         
          Julian waits a moment as a wall clock TICKS.
                         
                                                JULIAN
                    Vicky?
                         
          He sees his bedroom light turn on.
                         
                              VICKY (O.S.)
                    All clear, little dude.
                         
          Vicky pops her head out of his bedroom.
                         
                                             VICKY (CONT'D)
                    Nothing to be afraid of.
                         
                         
          INT. GARAGE. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Dave takes a hit and looks around the shed. A bad ass old
          MOTORCYCLE collecting dust.
                         
                                                DAVE
                    Sick bike.
                         
          He walks over and sits down on it.
                         
                         
          INT. BEDROOM. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Vicky sits on the bed with Julian. She shuts off the bedside
          lamp. The glow of an aquarium gives light.
                         
                                             JULIAN
                    Will you turn on the closet light?
                         
          She look to the closet door then turns to Julian.
                         
                                             VICKY
                    Then you go to sleep for real.
                         
          She tucks him in and heads for the closet.
                         
          AT THE CLOSET. She opens the closet door. She reaches in for
          the light switch and turns it on.                               
                         
          The light REVEALS: THE SHAPE STANDING IN THE CLOSET.            
                         
                         JULIAN SEES:
                         
                                                JULIAN
                    Oh shit!!!
                         
          Before she can react, The Shape grabs her neck with one hand
          and brings the knife down with the other hand.
                                                                  59.
                         
                         
          The knife STABS VICKY'S SHOULDER-- the blade cuts down her
          arm.
                         
          Vicky pushes away from The Shape and falls backwards.
                         
          Julian SCREAMS and scrambles toward the door, RUNNING...
                         
          The Shape turns...
                         
                         
          INT. GARAGE. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT                          
                         
          Dave revs the motor-cycle and looks up as he hears distant
          screams. He turns off the bike and listens. He gets off and
          accidentally knocks the bike over.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    Aww. Idiot.
                         
          He struggles to pull it back up.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Julian runs down the stairs.
                         
          Vicky darts out of his bedroom, but HER SOCKS INSTANTLY SLIP
          out from underneath her on the wood floor. She lands hard--
          knocking the breath out of her.
                         
          Julian runs back up the stairs and looks back.
                         
          BEHIND VICKY, The Shape appears from the bedroom, the glint
          of his knife catches the light.
                         
                                              JULIAN
                    Nope.
                         
          He turns and runs again.
                         
          The Shape steps towards Vicky. She rolls over and SHRIEKS.
                         
          The Shape grabs her feet and pulls her back into the room.
                         
                                              VICKY
                    RUUUUN!!
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Julian dashes through the kitchen right into Dave as he steps    
          back inside. Julian screams in his face.
                                                                  60.
                         
                         
                                             DAVE
                    Dude! Chill. Why are you
                    screechin'?
                         
                                             JULIAN
                    There's a man up there!
                         
                                             DAVE
                    There's no man up there.
                         
                                             JULIAN
                    You go up there, you're gonna get
                    killed, Dave!
                         
          Julian runs out the door.
                         
          Dave shakes his head and grabs A LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE             
          playfully. He adjusts his straw hat.
                         
                                             DAVE
                    Oh yeah? Come get some Dave.
                         
                         
          INT. HIGH SCHOOL. GYM. NIGHT.
                         
          Oscar chows down on a giant pickle at the catering table.
          Allyson smiles as she dances with some friends.
                         
          She notices Cameron talking to a girl in a black cat costume,
          KIM. Cameron is still in drag. His back is to Allyson. A
          moment of jealousy strikes Allyson's face. THEN...
                         
          The girl takes his hand, leans in and kisses Cameron's neck.
          The two turn around and Cameron looks up to see a visibly
          upset Allyson. He pulls away from Kim.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    Allyson. Come here!
                         
          Her head shakes "no". He nods "yes". She shakes "no". He
          takes a discreet pull from his flask, whispers something to      
          Kim, then he walks across to where Allyson stands.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    What are you doing? What was that?
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    I just need a kiss from you.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Looks like you just got one from
                    Kim?
                                                                  61.
                         
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    That was nothing.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Really?
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    Yeah. Every time I turn around,
                    you're in your phone. Looking at                       
                    it, texting with people, talking
                    with people. It sucks. And I didn't
                    do anything with Kim. She came up
                    to me. Gave ME a kiss. Don't cry
                    about it.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    You're drunk. Oscar got you fucked
                    up.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    Come 'ere. Come on.
                         
          He grabs her arm and pulls her toward him.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Don't.
                         
          Her phone vibrates. She looks: "Mom". Cameron looks pissed.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    See! This piece of shit.
                         
          He grabs her phone and throws it into a massive bowl of nacho
          cheese on the catering table.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    What the fuck?!
                         
                         
          INT. LAURIE'S CAR. NIGHT. (MOVING)
                         
          Laurie listens to the police scanner. A call on the radio
          gets her attention:
                         
                              DISPATCH (O.S.)

                              OFFICER HAWKINS (O.S.)
                                       (OVER RADIO)
                    Copy.
                         
          Laurie takes off down the road, determined.
                                                                 62.
                         
                         
          EXT. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Hawkins pulls his squad car quietly to a stop and moves to
          the back of the house with his gun drawn.
                         
                         
          EXT. BACKYARD. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.
                         
          Hawkins looks up and down... Listening intently.
                         
          He looks to the backyard and sees the clothes line, now with
          only ONE SHEET blowing in the breeze.
                         
          The back door is open.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.
                         
          Hawkins enters, weapon drawn and flashlight shining. All is
          silent. He calls out:
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Haddonfield Sheriff's department.
                    Responding to a domestic
                    disturbance!
                         
          He holds his gun with arms outstretched.
                         
                              OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                    I repeat! This is Officer Hawkins.
                    Please respond!
                         
          The kitchen is empty. He hears the sound of the television
          coming from another room.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE STAIRCASE. Hawkins heading up. He creeps around    
          the corner...
                         
                         
          INT. BEDROOM. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Hawkins stands in the door of Julian's room. The glowing of
          the aquarium illuminates. He eyes a jack-o-lantern with a
          candle in it on the toy shelf.
                         
          In the middle of the room sits a figure with a white sheet
          covering it like a ghost.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Hands on your head. Come out NOW!
                                                                    63.
                         
                         
          He enters. Gun aimed at the ghost.
                         
          Hawkins steps to the white sheet.
                         
          Hawkins aims...
                         
          Hawkins carefully pulls the sheer off- REVEALING VICKY in the
          beam of his flashlight. Stab wounds have gashed her. The         
          horror hits him.
                         
                         
          EXT. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
                         
          Laurie arrives. She uneasily scans the neighborhood;
          surveying the street, the shadows, pumpkins on porches.
                         
          A firecracker POPS and she flinches.
                         
          She turns and sees the silhouette of a small WITCH standing
          way down the street, lighting firecrackers-- POP POP.
                         
          Two more silhouettes join the Witch, a SKULL HEAD and a
          PUMPKIN HEAD, and they turn and run with their candy bags.
                         
          Laurie shifts her eyes... looks upstairs.
                         
          A light turns on in the bedroom window. Hawkins is in the
          window of the crime scene.
                         
          She turns to the window of the next room.
                         
          The Shape stands staring at Laurie. The sight of him makes
          Laurie's heart drop. She GASPS. The look between the two has
          forty years of tension.
                         
          Laurie raises her gun and fires. It's a direct hit at her
          target, but it is revealed that it represents just the           
          reflection of The Shape in a mirror.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
                         
          Hawkins jolts at hearing the gunshot. He sees The Shape
          walking down the stairs.                                         
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Stop or I'll fire!
                         
          The Shape continues and Hawkins open fire-- BAM! BAM!
                         
          The Shape disappears.
                         
          Hawkins chases downstairs after him.
                                                                   64.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
                         
          Hawkins glances around the corner. He sees a trail of blood
          on the floor.
                         
          He steps into the living room. He sees DAVE-- DEAD-- a large
          knife pins him through the neck with his face smashed into
          the wall like a ceremonial slaying. The blood from Dave's        
          fresh tattoo oozes from his shoulder.
                         
          Hawkins is horrified and slips on the bloody floor.
                         
                         
          EXT. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
                         
          Laurie scans the yard.
                         
          The Shape appears around the corner of the house, walking
          toward the back gate.
                         
          Laurie raises her gun. She fires-- PAP.
                         
          The Shape is hit in the back of the shoulder and falls
          forward out of frame around the corner of the house.
                         
          Laurie runs toward to the corner, gun still aimed. She turns
          the corner.
                         
          He is gone.
                         
          Just then, Hawkins appears and whispers to Laurie.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Where is he?!
                         
          Laurie is started, turns and punches Hawkins in the face with
          her fist. He drops.

                    Fuck! Jesus! What the fuck?!
                         
          Hawkins sits up and rubs his bruised jaw.
                         
                                             LAURIE (CONT'D)
                    Don't creep up on a girl in the
                    dark unless you want to get
                    punched.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    You were told to go home.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    I shot him! I almost shot you too.
                                                                  65.
                         
                         
          Hawkins recovers and walks into the street. He sees nothing.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Did you see which way he went?
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    No. But do me do me favor. If you
                    find him before I do, finish him.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Sure. Sure. You get a license for
                    that fire arm, lady?
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    I do. And this one too.
                         
          Laurie pulls a Glock 34 out of her pocket.
                         
          Hawkins raises an eyebrow.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. MOMENTS LATER.
                         
          MONTAGE: POLICE CARS, OFFICERS and DOGS search the street for
          The Shape.
                         
          Sheriff Barker pulls up in his unmarked vehicle.
                         
                                             SHERIFF BARKER
                    Hawkins, look who's up!
                         
          Sartain steps out of the passenger side with his left arm in
          a sling.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Where is he?
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    You tell me.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. MOMENTS LATER.
                         
          Hawkins and the Sheriff speak with Dr. Sartain. Sartain is in
          visible pain and discomfort.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    The bus lost control after Michael
                    overtook the first guard, then the
                    driver. He is no longer dormant. I
                    saw him kill with my own eyes. He
                    only knows how to keep moving and
                    to keep killing and he will kill
                    again unless he is captured.
                                                                   66.
                         
                         
                                             SHERIFF BARKER
                    What I want to know is why he
                    didn't kill you?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    I tried to hide, but he found me.
                    Locked me to a seat. He looked down
                    at me. I closed my eyes and when I
                    opened them, he walked away.
                         
          Barker looks to Hawkins.
                         
                                             SHERIFF BARKER
                    Hawkins, come talk to me for a
                    second. Doctor, please wait here.
                         
          The Sheriff and Hawkins walk away speaking discretely.
                         
                              SHERIFF BARKER (CONT'D)
                    He's an asset.
                         
                                              OFFICER HAWKINS
                    He's not an asset, he's a
                    liability.
                         
                                             SHERIFF BARKER
                    You're going to take him. He knows
                    Myers better than anyone.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    You want me to take this injured
                    civilian to search for a
                    psychopathic serial killer?
                         
                                             SHERIFF BARKER
                    You were right. I was wrong. We're
                    clearing the streets. Patrol cars
                    on every corner. I'm going
                    statewide with this. Let's find
                    this son of a bitch. You hear me?
                         
                              LAURIE (O.S.)
                    Sheriff Barker, Officer Hawkins?
                         
          They look back. Laurie is walking over.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    We don't need your help right now,
                    Ms. Strode.
                         
          Sartain sees Laurie and approaches. He recognizes her.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Excuse me, officers.
                                                                  67.
                         
                         
          Laurie stops.
                         
                                             SHERIFF BARKER
                    Laurie Strode, meet Dr. Sartain.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    I'm Michael's doctor. Ranbir
                    Sartain.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    You're the new Loomis. I can tell
                    by the classy accent.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    I've read everything about you in
                    his case files. Do you know our
                    friend Mr. Hawkins here was the
                    responding deputy when Michael was
                    apprehended in 1978?
                         
          Barker glances curiously at Sartain.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
                    He lawfully stood between doctor
                    Loomis' vindictive tirade and the
                    right to a fair trial.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    Loomis calling for his execution
                    didn't persuade you?
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    I used to believe that due process
                    balanced the power of the law of
                    the land. I'm not so sure anymore.
                         
          Sartain turns and walks to the passenger seat of Hawkins'
          car, leaving Laurie standing with Hawkins and Barker.          
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    I prayed everyday that he would
                    escape.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    What the hell did you do that for?
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    So I could kill him.
                         
          The Sheriff shakes his head.   Hawkins considers this for a
          moment.
                                                                 68.
                         
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Well, that was a dumb thing to pray
                    for...
                         
          As he gets into his car...
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Will you come with us?
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    No. I need to protect my family.
                         
                                             SHERIFF BARKER
                    We have you covered, ma'am.
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. FOOTBALL FIELD. NIGHT.
                         
          Allyson tries to get her phone to work. Dried cheese chunks
          in the charger port. Cameron jogs up. Wig in hand. He's
          drunk.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    Just put it in a bag of rice. It'll
                    be fine.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    I leave you alone for literally two
                    minutes and you run to talk to the
                    one girl that stresses me out. Then
                    you break my phone?!
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    Listen. I had too much gin. I told
                    you. Kim was talking to me. She
                    came on to me. I'm trying to be
                    respectful that she still has
                    feelings. I'm sorry. She already
                    has eating issues and I don't want
                    to make it worse. What was I
                    supposed to do?
                         
          She looks at her phone.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    It's ruined. It's totally sticky
                    with fucking Velveeta on it.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    Good! Now we actually have to blab
                    to each other. Seriously. Let's
                    have some fun. Please. If we don't
                    this is a completely degrading
                    experience. I'm serious.
                                                                    69.
                         
                         
          Cameron looks heartbroken, frustrated. She smiles. He leans
          in for a kiss.
                         
          At that moment, a SPOTLIGHT shines on them.
                         
          TWO PATROL CARS pull up in front of the football field.
                         
          FOUR COPS pull out flashlights and approach Cameron and
          Allyson.
                         
                                             OFFICER #1
                    You guys gotta clear out of here.
                    Party's over! Gotta clear out!
                         
                                             OFFICER #2
                    Curfew has been put into place.
                    It's not safe! You guys need a ride
                    home?
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    What's happening? Why aren't we
                    safe? Why do we need to go?
                         
                                             OFFICER #1
                    Because I fuckin' said so. It's not
                    safe to be on the streets. We need
                    you to get home. Now.

                    We were just leaving-
                         
          Cameron interrupts.
                         
                                             CAMERON
                    No we weren't. Dude. We're in the
                    middle of a fight and we were at
                    the point of a breakthrough when
                    you shined that goddamn flashlight
                    in my face! Why you gotta be dicks-

          The cops look at each other and then engage.

                    Your mom dress you up like that?
                         
          The officers start laughing. Cameron shifts darker.

                    I know exactly what you'll do.
                    Assault a police officer. You'll
                    sit on the roof of your garage and
                    throw rotten eggs at me like you
                    did last time.

          The Officer slams Cameron to the ground. Oscar shows up. A
          dozen KIDS behind him.

                    Cameron? What's up dude? Are you
                    being misunderstood again. This is

                    on school grounds. We don't have

          Cameron looks to Allyson only she's pissed and turns away.
          Cameron looks to Oscar.

          Shanah notices FOUR POLICE OFFICERS in the street behind her.

                    Allyson, you need to call me the
                    second you get this. The police
                    said the dance was evacuated and I
                    haven't heard from you. We're
                    heading to your Grandmother's

                    Where are you, baby? There are
                    police officers at your house. Get
                    to them and they'll bring you to
                    us. We're all together now. We love

          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT.
                         
          Oscar and Allyson walk down the sidewalk. Oscar carries a
          case of beer.
                         
                              LAURIE (O.S.)
                    Wherever you are... It's not safe

                                             OSCAR
                    This is an amazing night, right?!
                    Don't you just love Cameron?
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    No. I think he's a jerk.
                         
                                              OSCAR
                    He's cool. So bad ass. But I can
                    tell you're pissed about your
                    phone. He plopped it into the chili
                    con queso.
                                       (BEAMING)
                    Classic Cameron!
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    I'm tired of people letting me
                    down. You give them the benefit of
                    the doubt and think they're going
                    to be different, but then they show
                    you who they truly are. Cameron
                    doesn't want people to judge him,
                    but then he acts like a jerk. Gets
                    drunk, gets arrested.
                         
          Oscar stops. She turns.
                         
                                             OSCAR
                    You deserve better. You're the
                    smartest, most beautiful girl at
                    school. Anyone that doesn't
                    appreciate that is crazy.

          She considers this and smiles.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Thanks Oscar, that's sweet.

                    this rendezvous.
                         
          HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR drives by just as Allyson and Oscar cut
          between two houses.
                         
                         
          INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR (MOVING). NIGHT.
                         
          Hawkins is patrolling the streets. Dr. Sartain rides shotgun
          and holds a spotlight scanning for signs of Myers.

                    From a clinical perspective, would
                    you say that Laurie Strode has lost
                    her fucking marbles?
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    There are many ways for tragedy to
                    change a victim. They can grow
                    accustomed to always being afraid.
                    They can become weak or they can
                    become strong. But there is also
                    the other side.

                    The core of the victimizer. This is                   
                    what has intrigued me through my
                    studies. How does a crime like
                    Michael's change him? What is he
                    feeling? Is he on a random path or
                    is he emotionally driven? Triggered
                    by something. Some unheard marching                   
                    order imprinted on his very being?
                    Evil incarnate. Michael and I had a
                    special connection, but without his
                    verbal participation there was a
                    side of his mad journey that I
                    could never understand.

                    thing but for serial killer
                    groupies and death metal bands.
                    Vandals got the best of it. A local
                    organization that I work with tore
                    it down and turned it into a
                    community garden. Turned tragedy
                    into beauty if you can consider it.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. BACKYARD. NIGHT.
                         
          Oscar jumps over the BLACK IRON FENCE into a backyard. He
          awkwardly handles his beer. He sets it down and looks around.
          In the moonlight, he makes out the fence way at the opposite     
          end. Allyson climbs up to cross over.
                         
                                             OSCAR
                    Watch out for the poison ivy. It's
                    all over.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    This is a dumb short cut.
                         
                                             OSCAR
                    Treacherous. Let me give you a
                    hand.
                         
          Oscar reaches up to help her down from the fence. She almost
          slips. He catches her and lowers her down safely.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Thanks.
                         
          He doesn't let go. He grins at her.
                         
                                             ALLYSON (CONT'D)
                    What? What are you doing?
                         
                                             OSCAR
                    You deserve better.
                         
          He awkwardly leans in to kiss her on the lips.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Ew. Oscar. What the fuck?!
                         
          She pushes him off. Oscar realizes what just happened.
                                                                    75.
                         
                         
                                             OSCAR
                    Wait, I thought you said you
                    weren't with Cameron anymore.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Doesn't mean I want- Get away from
                    me.
                         
                                             OSCAR
                    I thought you were sending me
                    signals.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Definitely no signals. Just go!
                         
          She walks off into the darkness of the yard. He follows
          desperately.
                         
                                             OSCAR
                                       (EMBARRASSED)
                    I'm sorry. Please don't tell                           
                    Cameron I did that. I didn't feel
                    anything either.
                         
          She stops and turns to face him.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    You're disgusting. I'm going home.
                    You need to figure your shit out.
                         
          She walks off. Leaves him standing there.
                         
          A MOTION sensor LIGHT is activated, turning on a BRIGHT YARD
          LIGHT.
                         
                                             OSCAR
                                       (TO HIMSELF)
                    I'm drunk. Like... really drunk,
                    and I got all horny at the party, I
                    was dancing with some girl, this
                    way out of my league girl and my
                    brain got all sexed up, and her
                    tits got me totally chubbed out
                    when she was feeding me guacamole
                    in sexy ways--
                         
          Oscar drops his case of beer. One of them sprays.
                         
                                             OSCAR (CONT'D)
                    SHIT!
                         
          Cans roll out. He scrambles to pick them up. He looks up and
          sees the Shape standing twenty feet away.
                                                                  76.
                         
                         
                                             OSCAR (CONT'D)
                    Happy Halloween, Mr. Elrod. Cool
                    mask. Sorry... I'm not trying to
                    trespass on your shit, I was just
                    talking to this pretty girl over
                    there. It's just... I guess, I
                    always kind of liked her. And I
                    know she's bummed out about Cameron
                    so I thought maybe... Stupid,                          
                    right?
                         
          The Shape stands. No response.
                         
                                             OSCAR (CONT'D)
                    All right. Peace. Thank you.
                         
          THE LIGHT GOES OUT.
                         
          AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE YARD, Allyson makes it to the six foot
          BLACK IRON FENCE and starts to climb. She grabs one of the       
          sharp metal spikes that jut from the top and pulls her hand.
          It's slightly precarious but she's careful to avoid the iron
          spikes as she climbs over. She drops to the other side and
          walks down an alley. Disappointed.
                         
          ON OSCAR as THE LIGHT COMES BACK ON.
                         
          Oscar looks around and sees no one.
                         
                                             OSCAR (CONT'D)
                    Yo! Where'd you go, bro? You're
                    acting super sketchy right now.
                         
          He's confused and looks over his shoulder as he walks again
          to cross the yard. He runs straight into THE SHAPE and gasps.
                         
          He drops his beer as A KNIFE RAISES. Oscar put his arm up.
                         
          THE LIGHT TURNS OFF. TOTAL BLACKNESS.
                         
          ON ALLYSON DOWN THE STREET as she hear A SCREAM. She stops.
          Looks back.
                         
          THE LIGHTS TURN BACK ON.
                         
          Oscar runs as fast as he can. He's bleeding from his forearm.
                         
          The Shape walks behind him.
                         
          Oscar gets to the fence and leaps for the top bar. He gets       
          halfway over and snags his cape.
                         
          Oscar sees The Shape drawing closer with his knife raised. He
          stabs Oscar in the back and grabs at his feet.
                                                                    77.
                         
                         
          Oscar struggles to hang on as he SCREAMS.
                         
          THE LIGHTS TURN OFF.
                         
          We faintly see Oscar as he loses the battle. His jaw gets
          impaled by the sharp iron spike of the fence.                    
                         
          TOTAL BLACKNESS.
                         
          ON ALLYSON as she walkway cautiously toward the scream.
                         
                                             AARON
                    Oscar?!! Oscar?!
                         
          In the darkness, she arrives at the fence.
                         
          THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON.
                         
          SHE SEES OSCAR. His face has been pierced from the chin
          through his mouth by one of the iron spikes at the top of the    
          fence. He chokes and gags, gargling blood.
                         
          Allyson starts to hyperventilate and turns her head to see
          the yard. For a split second she sees The Shape standing ON
          HER SIDE of the fence, holding a knife.
                         
          THE LIGHTS GO OFF. She screams and runs like hell.
                         
          Allyson runs faster than she's ever run before... Out of the
          darkness into the open neighborhood.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT.
                         
          EXTREME WIDE SHOT OF THE STREET. Allyson looks to a house
          that has a light on inside. She runs up to the porch and
          pounds her fists desperately on the door.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Help me!! Open the door!
                         
          Another light switches on in a window.
                         
                                             ALLYSON (CONT'D)
                    Please open the door!                                  
                         
          EXTREME CLOSE-UP as Allyson bangs on the door. A face APPEARS
          in a window.
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE CRUISER. (MOVING) NIGHT.
                         
          Laurie, Shanah and Ray ride in back. Officer Richards drives.
          Officer Francis sits in the front passenger seat.                
                                                                    78.
                         
                         
          Shanah's phone rings, "Unknown Caller".
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    Hello? - Allyson? - Thank God
                    you're all right. Where are you?!
                         
          Laurie looks at her reflection in the window as Shanah
          listens to Allyson's story.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT.
                         
          Breathing. A POV hangs behind a tree. Looks left and right.
          Starts walking. Looks left.
                         
          Hawkins' vehicle appears suddenly and drives past fast.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          Hawkins pulls up as Allyson stands with a crowd of NEIGHBORS.
          She runs to him as he steps out of his car.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Officer! I saw him. My friend was
                    attacked! He came out of nowhere-
                         
          Allyson breathes heavily. Hawkins comforts her.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Take a deep breath, Allyson. You're
                    going to be all right. Take a deep
                    breath.
                         
                         
          EXT. RURAL ROAD. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          The squad car pulls up to Laurie's gate. A HARSH overhead
          SPOTLIGHT let's us know where we are. Laurie types in a
          password and the security GATE OPENS.
                         
                                             OFFICER FRANCIS
                    We'll drop you off and wait at the
                    gate for your girl to arrive. We
                    have an officer on the scene in
                    contact with her now.
                         
          They enter.
                         
                         
          INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Several locks and reinforcements detach as Laurie, Shanah and
          Ray step into Laurie's home.
                                                                    79.
                         
                         
          Shanah looks around the familiar house. It's been a while.
                         
          Ray and Shanah explore the various details of the interior.
          The fireplace has been sealed off with concrete, dead-bolt
          locks on interior doors, windows with security bars.
                         
                                             RAY
                    Home is where the heart is, right                      
                    Laurie?
                         
          Laurie stares at him. Ray points to a dead rat in a vicious-
          looking trap.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    I saw your mousetraps, Ray. Peanut
                    butter and marshmallow fluff?
                         
          Shanah takes a pensive moment before she twists the kitchen
          island counter-clockwise and lifts the door to the
          underground shelter. Ray looks curious.
                         
                                             RAY
                    What's this?
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    My childhood.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    It's how we protect ourselves.
                         
          Shanah disappears down the ladder. The light from within
          turns on. Laurie and Ray approach and look down.
                         
          INSIDE THE SHELTER:
                         
          They see a woman prepared. Food. Water. Weapons. A bed. In
          contrast to the rest of the house, it's a clean and organized
          illustration of Laurie's fears.
                         
          Shanah climbs down the ladder and feels the wave of her
          troubled youth wash over her.
                         
          Laurie and Ray come down behind her. Laurie types in a           
          password, "103178" and reveals a gun cabinet full of weapons.    
                         
                                             LAURIE (CONT'D)
                    Pick your poison. Do you need small
                    caliber defense, semi-automatic
                    ballistics with brownout rounds, a
                    shotgun for tactical operations or                     
                    a rifle with accuracy and stopping
                    power?
                         
          They look at Laurie's confidence. Or is she coming unglued?      
                                                                    80.

                    He's waited for this night. He's
                    waited for me. I've been waiting
                    for him.
                         
                         
          INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR (MOVING). NIGHT.
                         
          Hawkins looks at Allyson in the mirror. He turns to look at
          her through the METAL barrier and talks into the radio.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS

                                             ALLYSON
                    I haven't been to her house in
                    years, but I think I can give you
                    directions from the-
                         
          Allyson's eye strain. She POINTS AND SCREAMS:
                         
                                                ALLYSON (CONT'D)
                    LOOK OUT!!
                         
          Hawkins turns and see SOMEONE walk in front of his car.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS

                    Brace yourself.
                         
          He presses the gas and swerves to hit The Shape. Nails him.      
          Knocks him to the concrete.
                         
          The car screeches to a halt.                                     
                         
          Allyson cowers in the back. Hawkins checks his gun.
                         
                              OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                    Stay in the car!
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. CONTINUOUS.
                         
          Sartain and Hawkins get out. Hawkins has his gun drawn as he
          approaches The Shape.
                         
          Allyson watches from inside.
                                                                     81.
                         
                         
          Sartain steps up cautiously from behind Hawkins, passes him
          and examines The Shape, feeling the pulse on his neck.            
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    He's alive.
                         
          Hawkins raises his gun.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    Not for long. Stand back.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Officer Hawkins, do not kill my
                    patient.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                    I'm finishing this.                                     
                         
          Hawkins takes aim on The Shape. Sartain stands in his way.
                         
                              OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                    Get back, now. I'm going to fire!                       
                         
          Sartain takes a deep breath and pull his pen from his pocket.
          He clicks it nervously.
                         
                              OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                    I'm not going to ask you again,
                    Doctor. Stand back!
                         
          Sartain slides the clip of his pen to the side. The ink point
          retracts, and A SHARP, TWO-INCH BLADE flicks out.
                         
          Sartain grips the blade, turns around, quickly grabs Hawkins
          gun hand and stabs the steel straight into Hawkins' neck!
                         
          THE GUN GOES OFF AND DROPS.
                         
          Sartain sharply slashes his throat.
                         
          Allyson's eyes go wide. She can't believe what she's seeing.
                         
          Sartain inhales the feeling of his kill. He pulls the pen out
          of Hawkins's neck, and we REVEAL: A long bloody BLADE-- CLICK
          -- the blade retracts.
                         
          Hawkins drops.
                         
          Sartain turns to Allyson looking at him from the car. He          
          speaks calmly.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Don't move, Young lady. Do not
                    scream. Stay where you are.
                                                                   82.
                         
                         
          INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. CONTINUOUS.
                         
          FROM THE BACK OF THE CAR, Allyson watches Sartain through the
          barrier. She scrambles to get out door. Locked. She sees
          Sartain smiling at her. Then he BENDS down OUT OF SIGHT.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. CONTINUOUS.
                         
          Sartain squats, looking at his patient passed out. The Shape
          is motionless. Sartain puts a knee on The Shape's chest...
                         
          INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. CONTINUOUS.
                         
          Allyson sees him stand back up at the hood of the car.
          Sartain is wearing THE MASK.
                         
          Allyson huddles down, SCREAMING.
                         
          Sartain screams in the mask with her, banging on the hood of
          the car.
                         
          Allyson SCREAMS, trapped in the backseat.
                         
          Sartain stops moving. He stands still looking at Allyson,
          silent.
                         
          Allyson is crying now. Pleading:
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Please... Don't.
                         
          Sartain walks up to her window. He stares at Allyson and
          makes a "shush" finger on the mask, then walks over to The
          Shape.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                                       (WHISPERS)
                    This is a dream.
                         
          Allyson watches out the window. She panics.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    No! please no! Please!
                         
          Sartain awkwardly lifts the unconscious Shape into the back
          seat with Allyson. He struggles with the pain of his wounded
          arm . His body slumps over leaning on her. She sees THE
          SHAPE'S greasy hair touch her.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Make room, my dear. Mindful of my
                    patient.
                        (to The Shape)
                                                                  83.
                               DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
                    Are you with us, Michael? Are you
                    listening?
                                       (TO ALLYSON)
                    I don't believe he hears
                    everything.
                         
          Allyson pushes The Shape off of her.
                         
          Sartain takes off THE MASK and throws it in. It lands on the
          seat between her and The Shape. He closes the door.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                                       (SCREAMING)
                    NO! GET ME OUT OF HERE! HELP!
                         
          She frantically tries to open her door. Sartain get in the
          front seat and drives off.
                         
                         
          INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR (MOVING). NIGHT.
                         
          IN BACK, Allyson cowers against the door opposite The Shape.
          His face is shrouded in shadow, lit briefly as they pass
          under street lamps.
                         
          Allyson whimpers as The Shape jostles in his seat. He slowly
          starts SLIDING DOWN TOWARDS HER. She uses her feet to push
          his body away and back onto his side.
                         
          She crawls against the door watching The Shape.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    Michael, I see why you are who you
                    are. The sensation is obvious. The
                    thrill is exhilarating. Loomis was
                    a coward. He was afraid to travel
                    to such depths for you. But I love
                    you and I know you feel the same
                    way. I freed you from those
                    unwilling to understand you. Those
                    of archaic mind.
                         
          Allyson is desperate.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                        (weeping to herself)
                    Let me go. Please.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    The look on your face when you saw                    
                    freedom? And then the carnage and
                    confusion we created?                                 
                                                                  84.
                         
                         
          She looks at Sartain's eyes in the rearview mirror watching
          her, cold, calculating, perverse. She looks down at THE MASK
          sitting on the seat between her and The Shape.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
                    I'm glad we're together, Michael.
                         
          Allyson wipes her eyes.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                                       (DESPERATE)
                    Please... Where are you taking me?!
                         
          Sartain chuckles and keeps driving.
                         
          Allyson looks back down. POV: the seat is empty-- NO MASK.
                         
          PAN UP FROM THE SEAT:
                         
          THE SHAPE IS WEARING THE MASK LOOKING AT HER!                   
                         
          Before she can scream, The Shape grabs Allyson's hair and
          throws her into the passenger side door.
                         
          He scoots back and lifts his leg; KICKS HIS WINDOW WITH HIS
          BOOT.
                         
          The car starts to swerve out of control as he fractures the
          glass.
                         
          The car jerks right and Allyson slams against the door...
                         
          The car skids to a stop at a slight angle in the middle of a
          rural road.
                         
          The Shape goes into a fit in the back seat.
                         
          Sartain remains calm. He looks at THE POLICE CRUISER that is    
          guarding the gate to Laurie's compound a hundred yards away.
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT
                         
          Officer Richards and Officer Francis listen to rock music on
          the radio and eat food.
                         
                                             OFFICER RICHARDS
                    You know what sounds good with a                      
                    baloney sandwich?
                         
          Francis see something in the distance.
                         
                                 OFFICER RICHARDS (CONT'D)
                    ...An IPA.
                                                                  85.

                    What the hell?
                         
          They strain their eyes as they see the flashing lights and
          blinding headlights of the distant vehicle parked in the
          middle of the road.
                         
                         
          INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. NIGHT.
                         
          The Shape kicks the window in the back seat while Sartain
          sits calmly in the front.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    What greater spectacle than to
                    reunite two old friends. Michael
                    Myers and Laurie Strode. A
                    historical reunion.
                         
          The back seat settles. All is quiet until...
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
                    Michael. She's been waiting for
                    you. Are you ready?
                         
          SUDDENLY, the barrier from behind Sartain is thrust with
          brute strength inward. Its velocity pins Dr. Sartain against
          the steering wheel.
                         
          Allyson screams as the cage slams Sartain until he is still.
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT.
                         
          The cops look at the car ahead. They can't see the commotion
          because of the glare of the lights. They turn off their
          radio. They hear the horn blaring.
                         
                                             OFFICER RICHARDS
                                       (INTO RADIO)
                    601? 606 to 601? Hawkins. Turn your
                    fuckin' radio on. Hawkins?
                         
                                             OFFICER FRANCIS
                    Let's check it out.
                         
          Officer Richards puts the car in gear.
                         
                         
          INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. NIGHT.
                         
          The Shape is out. Allyson panics in the back seat as The
          Shape grabs Sartain by the feet and drags him out of the car.
                                                                   86.
                         
                         
          His head hits the concrete hard. Sartain struggles. He is not
          unconscious yet.
                         
          The Shape takes a knee and gags Sartain against the pavement.
          He hears the loudspeaker from the police car.
                         
                                             OFFICER HAWKINS
                        (over P.A.)
                    Hawkins, please respond.
                         
          As The Shape stands to see the approaching police car,
          Allyson makes an escape and dashes into the woods.
                         
          The Shape watches her go and then looks down to an injured
          Sartain at his feet.
                         
                              DR. SARTAIN
                    But you said I could watch.
                         
          The Shape lift HIS BOOT OVER SARTAIN'S HEAD. Sartain looks at
          his own reflection in the metal side of the vehicle. A sick
          grin on the doctor's face--
                         
                                DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
                    Do it.
                         
          The SHAPE STOMPS DOWN ON DOCTOR SARTAIN'S HEAD. HIS SKULL
          CAVES IN-- BRAINS SHIT OUT.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
                         
          Allyson looks back and sees The Shape-- staring down at his      
          boot on Sartain's crushed skull.
                         
          The Shape TILTS HIS HEAD CURIOUSLY.
                         
          Allyson runs as fast as she can.
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT
                         
          The squad car has stopped. Officer Richards and Officer
          Francis strain their eyes to see clearly. Richards turns on
          his SPOTLIGHT.
                         
                                               OFFICER HAWKINS
                    It's him.
                         
                                             OFFICER RICHARDS
                                       (OVER SPEAKER)
                    Hands where I can see `um! DON'T
                    MOVE!!!
                                                                   87.
                         
                         
          The light blinds The Shape who DROPS DOWN TO THE GROUND OUT
          OF SIGHT OF THE OFFICERS.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROAD/POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT
                         
          Richards and Francis have their guns draw as they step toward
          the crime scene.
                         
          They throw hand signals then move about either direction of
          Hawkins' squad car.
                         
          They take a beat to find their courage and step to the other     
          side of the squad car.
                         
          THE SHAPE IS GONE. Just the gruesome remains of Doctor
          Sartain.
                         
          They don't see The Shape rising from behind them. Behind the
          flashing light of their own squad car. WATCHING.
                         
                         
          INT. BEDROOM. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Laurie looks out through the blinds of her bedroom window.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    I'm scared. I don't know how to do
                    this.
                         
          Laurie grabs Shanah's weapon and looks her in the eye.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    You never wanted to listen when I
                    spoke about that night... but this
                    is why. We fight to survive. He is
                    a killer. But he will be killed
                    tonight. I've been preparing for
                    this for a long time. And whether
                    you know it or not, so have you.
                         
          Shanah is scared, weeping, but shakes her head `yes'. Laurie
          sees how scared and unprepared her daughter is.
                         
                                             LAURIE (CONT'D)
                    Shanah... I'm sorry. For
                    everything.
                         
          Shanah sees her mom's eyes welling up. She hugs Laurie.
          Laurie hasn't felt this in years and hugs her as tight as she
          can.
                                                                    88.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
                         
          Allyson moves quickly through the woods. Bloody, tired,
          limping. She grabs a tree to catch her breath.
                         
          She sees the disturbing SILHOUETTES OF MANNEQUINS that Laurie
          used as target practice. Frozen expressions with bullet
          ridden faces all around her.
                         
                         
          INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Ray plays with the untangled yo-yo that Laurie had at the
          community center. He watches the security camera monitors.
                         
          He sees a police cruiser slowly rolling up to the front of
          the house. It hits a couple of garbage cans and then stops.
                         
          Curious, he gets up and goes to the front door. The door has
          two small windows with color glass. He sees the cruiser with
          lights flashing.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Ray steps out onto the front porch with the yo-yo as the wind
          chimes blow in the breeze.
                         
                                             RAY
                    Any word on Allyson?
                         
          No response.
                         
                                              RAY (CONT'D)
                    You guys need some coffee or
                    something?
                         
          Ray strains to see Officer Richards in the front seat of the
          cruiser. Ray waves. No response.
                         
          Ray moves toward the car, knocks on the window and then opens    
          the driver's side door.
                         
          What he sees is a mind-blowing moment of horror: Officer
          Richards has his throat slit and Doctor Sartain's pen blade
          jammed through his ear. AND- in his lap sits Officer Francis'
          head...
                         
          CARVED LIKE A JACK O' LANTERN WITH TRIANGLE EYES CUT OUT, A
          TRIANGLE HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE ONCE WAS AND A JAGGED SMILE CUT
          WITH A BLADE. A FLASH LIGHT POINTS UP THROUGH THE NECK
          ILLUMINATING THE ENTIRE NIGHTMARE.                               
                                                                    89.
                         
                         
          Ray loses his balance and takes a step back. He hears the
          familiar wind chimes.
                         
          Ray turns slowly and sees THE SHAPE step up behind him and
          instantly wrap the chain of the wind chime around Ray's neck.
                         
          He chokes and wheezes and swings his arms wildly trying to       
          save himself.
                         
          After a great struggle, he falls to the ground... Dead.          
                         
                         
          INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
                         
          Laurie walks down the steps holding a PUMP ACTION 12-GAUGE.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    Ray?
                         
          She steps up to the front door. She looks through the            
          distorted glass of the windows and sees in plain sight...
                         
          THE SHAPE with his back to her, standing perfectly still over
          Ray's body.
                         
          Laurie locks the door, cringes as she registers the scene and
          turns away.
                         
          She sees Shanah walk down the staircase.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    Mom?
                         
          Laurie shakes her head and holds her finger to her lips. She
          meets Shanah in the middle of the room.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    He's here Shanah. Michael is here.
                    Go to the shelter and hide. You'll
                    be safe there.
                         
                                             SHANAH
                    What about Ray? What about Allyson?
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    I'll take care of it. It's time.
                    Now. It all ends tonight.
                         
          Shanah nods through tears and runs to the kitchen. She spins
          the island counter clock-wise. She shares a look with Laurie
          as her mother takes position. Armed at the front door. Is
          this good-bye?
                                                                   90.
                         
                         
          Shanah disappears into the shelter and the island slides
          back, covering the secret door.
                         
          Laurie turns back toward the window with her shotgun to keep
          an eye along The Shape. Before she gets a glance, the glass
          of one window smashes.
                         
          THE SHAPE'S RIGHT ARM reaches through and grabs her by the
          side and then slides to her throat. Her weapon is useless as
          he pulls her into the door.
                         
          THE OTHER ARM punches through the other window and reaches
          desperately for her.
                         
          She spins around until her back is to the door. Her left hand
          reaches up and grabs hold of The Shape's spastic hand.           
                         
          With her right hand, Laurie PUMPS HER SHOTGUN and points it
          toward The Shape's LEFT HAND. He grabs hold of the barrel and
          she pulls the trigger. HIS LEFT HAND EXPLODES. TWO FINGERS
          disintegrated by the blast. His thumb and two others remain.     
          He lets go and his arms retreat.
                         
                         
          INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. BASEMENT. NIGHT
                         
          Shanah hears footsteps above her. She looks and considers the
          overwhelming arsenal beside her: A crossbow, a semi-automatic
          rifle, a shotgun and a small handgun, etc.
                         
          She grabs the smallest firearm on the wall and walks to the
          base of the ladder as footsteps pace above her.
                         
          She hears the island move aside and the hinges of the door
          lift open.
                         
          She's nervous, but the gun is ready. She pulls the trigger-
          CLICK.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    It only works if you load it,
                    Sweetheart.
                         
          She's relieved to see her mother who climbs quickly down with
          her shotgun to join her.
                         
          Laurie walks to the wall and exchanges her pump-action
          shotgun for a rifle.
                         
          She flips a circuit breaker to turn the lights off upstairs
          and then flips a switch to slide the island back into place.
                         
          They listen quietly as Laurie loads rounds into the rifle.
                                                                  91.
                         
                         
          The sound of the front door opening. FOOTSTEPS above them.
          Dust falls from the ceiling.
                         
          Laurie tracks the steps with the site of her gun.
                         
                                             LAURIE (CONT'D)
                    He's right there.
                         
          Laurie fire three rounds into the ceiling at the position she
          suspects The SHAPE to be. All goes silent.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          Allyson approaches and sees the house through the trees, face
          full with both fear and relief.
                         
                         
          INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
                         
          CLOSE on Laurie as she rises from her basement door with her
          rifle ready.
                         
          She looks around the dark living room and sees no sign of The
          Shape. Her senses are on high alert.
                         
                                               LAURIE
                    Michael?!
                         
          She hears a noise, turns and fires. Blasts a hole in the wall
          of the living room. The muzzle flash lights the room.
                         
                                             LAURIE (CONT'D)
                    Michael?! Come out.
                         
          Another sound. BLAM! She fires at a shadow.
                         
          A tree branch hits the window.
                         
          She turns, blasts the kitchen pantry.
                         
          Laurie walks to the living room. Blasts the staircase
          upstairs.
                         
          She disappears into a back room. We hear a three more blasts.
                         
          She comes back out and looks toward a living room closet. She
          shoots a hole in it. Listens. Hears weeping in the distance.
                         
          She looks out the broken window of the front door and sees
          Allyson crying. Her granddaughter kneeled over the body of
          her dead father.
                         
          Laurie switch gears from a predator to the protector.
                                                                  92.
                         
                         
                                             LAURIE (CONT'D)
                    Allyson, you can't be here.
                         
          She run to her upset granddaughter.
                         
                                             LAURIE (CONT'D)
                    I'm so sorry. It's not over. You
                    need to run. Run and hide. Go to
                    the road and don't look back. Get
                    help. Save yourself.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    I'm not leaving without you.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    You must. Go now. I love you.
                         
          Allyson gets up and walks backwards. She look to the front
          door and sees The Shape standing on the porch.
                         
                                             ALLYSON
                    Grandmother?!
                         
          Laurie turns and instinctively aims the gun toward The Shape
          and fires. The bullet blasts directly over The Shape's           
          shoulder. A porch light shatters.
                         
          -- Miss. She's out of bullets.
                         
          Laurie quickly drops the gun and pulls a large hunting knife
          out of a sheath on her belt. The Shape stands with a kitchen
          knife in his hand. A CLASSIC SHOWDOWN.
                         
          He steps off the porch toward her. Laurie looks back and sees
          Allyson stumbling backwards.
                         
          With the mind-set of a mamma bear, Laurie turns back to The
          Shape and charges him.
                         
          Their blades meet. Limbs entangled. The Shape loses blood        
          from his missing fingers, but his momentum is relentless. He
          drives his knife into Laurie's chest. She swings and slices      
          his arm.
                         
          Allyson screams.
                         
          On THE PORCH: We see Shanah slowly opening the front door
          with the POINT OF A HIGH TECH CROSSBOW.
                         
          After a brief struggle, The Shape twists his knife and forces
          Laurie to the ground. He pulls the blade out.
                                                                   93.
                         
                         
          Shanah's eyes swell with fear. Her jaw shakes as she takes
          aim. She considers the shot but instead lowers the crossbow
          in defeat.
                         
          Then Laurie catches her eye from the ground. A neutral           
          expression of control that says everything.
                         
          The Shape lifts his knife back for the deathblow, and before
          it falls, Shanah raises the crossbow and pulls the trigger,
          RELEASES HER ARROW.
                         
          It penetrates The Shape from behind. Underneath his right
          shoulder. The point and beak jut out by inches.                  
                         
          The Shape DROPS HIS knife and pulls the pointer and slides it
          back and forth. He gets to his feet and struggles to remove
          it.
                         
          Allyson walks toward them and grabs the fallen knife.
                         
          She keeps The Shape at bay as she grabs her grandmother under
          her arms and drags her back through the yard.
                         
          The Shape stumbles forward into the woods.
                         
          Shanah runs to Allyson and Laurie. They help her to her feet
          as she bleeds. Nearly unconscious. They put pressure on the
          wound.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          In a flurry of motion and panic, Shanah and Allyson run with
          Laurie. As they struggle down the long, dark wooded
          driveway, they breathe heavily, exhausted physically and         
          emotionally. Feet drag, bodies strain. The effort is arduous.
                         
          Laurie looks back at The Shape disappearing into the trees.
          She is in and out of consciousness.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    Kill it. Kill it. It must die.                         
                         
          Her whispers fall on deaf ears.
                         
          Shanah and Allyson miss it in the strain of their efforts.       
          They reach the gate which has been broken open.
                         
          Shanah holds Laurie while Allyson steps into the road and
          looks both ways.
                         
          Hawkins' abandoned squad car in one direction and a pair of
          headlights in the other direction.
                                                                   94.
                         
                         
          Allyson waves her arms as the headlights approach.
                         
          A PICK-UP TRUCK pulls over.
                         
          Shanah lifts Laurie toward the truck.   Allyson helps.           
                         
          THE DRIVER drops the gate of the bed of the truck.
                         
          The driver helps the severely injured Laurie into the truck.
                         
          Her daughter and granddaughter get in, sit beside her and
          hold her tight.
                         
          The truck ROARS INTO DRIVE and speeds down the road.
                         
          The woman rest, stunned and numb and reflective of the night     
          behind them.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
                         
          The Shape, wounded. He pulls the arrow from his chest and
          moves through the forest.
                         
          SIRENS WAIL in the distance. His WHITE mask catching the
          moonlight.
                         
          The Shape comes to a clearing. He turns and looks back in the
          direction of Laurie's house. He watches, BREATHING...
                         
          He touches his chest. Feels his wounds; his missing fingers.
                         
          We reveal that he is standing among the shattered artificial
          faces of mannequins.
                         
          The Shape walks to a tree and takes a seat. His head tilts
          back as his hand presses into his blood stained clothing. His    
          breathing deepens.
                         
          Exhausted, or possibly his last.

                          STARLING
                Give it up, Evelda.

                          DRUMGO 
                Well, you know my name, honey, but I
                don't know yours... 

                          STARLING

                that... 

     SHE STARTS GETTING INTO THE NURSES GARB. 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                Ain't this a picture, though, cause you
                know you ain't the first girl, ever got
                lef, in a position, waiting at the 
                doctor's.  You can't trust men, child,
                don't you know that.... old as you
                are...? 

     SHE WALKS BACK TOWARD STARLING, SCOOPS UP HER CHILD, PEEKS
     OUT THE WINDOW, AND STARTS FOR THE DOOR. 

                          DRUMGO (cont'd) 
                Cause, see, they'll always let you down.
                Terrible thing, to do to an orphan... 

     SHE LEANS BACK TOWARD STARLING, GRABS HER HAIR, AND PULLS HER

                    (AS SHE HANDS HIM THE SMALL
                     RADIO TRANSMITTER) 
                Yeah, well, you didn't get it cause your
                radio went dead.  The backup plan was,
                17.45, you guys are the Cavalry... 

     SHE GETS UP AND WALKS AWAY FROM THE DOORSTEP, TO A SEDAN,
     WHICH IS PULLING UP.  AS SHE GOES, SHE TAKES OFF THE FAKE
     BELLY SHE HAS BEEN WEARING.

     ANOTHER SWAT AGENT TAKES THE RADIO AND LOOKS AT IT.

                Well, well, well, well, well, she went 
                in there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon.
                Went in there with her gun, Came out,
                without the Felon, without the gun...

                          KRENDLER
                I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that. 

                          STARLING

                Oh, is this your political position,
                you're opposed to Joint...

     THEM, HE THEN, RELUCTANTLY, TURNS AWAY, BACK TO THE GROUP
     HE IS PART OF.

     ANGLE ON STARLING AND CRAWFORD, AS THEY DRAW AWAY FROM THE
     CONFERENCE ROOM GROUP. 

                          CRAWFORD
                    (SOTTO) 
                ...how'd you let her get that close to 
                you...? 

     IN THE B.G. WE SEE AN AIDE COME UP TO KRENDLER, AND HAND
     HIM A FILE.  STARLING WAVES OFF CRAWFORD'S QUESTION. 

                          CRAWFORD (cont' d) 
                ...how'd she get next to you? 

                          STARLING 
                    (AS IF TEARING OFF THE 
                     BANDAID )
                ...she gave me her baby. 

     KRENDLER, AND THE AID WALK TOWARD CRAWFORD.  THE AIDE
     WHISPERS SOMETHING TO KRENDLER. 

                          KRENDLER
                    (TO CRAWFORD) 
                She threw a punch at a man on the team. 

                          CRAWFORD 
                Well, you know, that happens, on the
                street. 

                          KRENDLER 
                What is that supposed to mean...? 

                          CRAWFORD 
                I think its meaning is clear. 

                          KRENDLER 
                What, you're saying she was overwrought. 

                          CRAWFORD
                That could be. 

                          KRENDLER 
                Because that's understandable, because.
                She blew the raid. 

                          CRAWFORD 
                She was there, alone, sir, she was in a
                burning building, waiting for your folks
                to come through the wall.  And... 

     STARLING STARTS AWAY, IN DISGUST. 

                          KRENDLER 
                One moment, I'm not done with you...
                    (TO CRAWFORD, AS KRENDLER 
                     MOTIONS HIS AIDE TO HAND HIM
                     A FILE) 
                Give him the file... 

                          AIDE 
                I thought it was going to go down the 
                line, to.... 

                          KRENDLER 
                No, no, no, I want the girl to do it... 

     THEY GO INTO A HUDDLE, AND STARLING MOVES AWAY, WAITING.
     SHE LOOKS AROUND, AND SHE AND WE DISCOVER SHE IS STANDING
     IN FRONT OF THE "LECHTERIANA" SECTION OF THE FBI DISPLAY.
     THE GUIDE IS ADDRESSING THE VISITING FOREIGN COPS.

     HER FATE, AND THE MEN TALKING ABOUT HER.

                It is, of course, a bounty poster, the
                only one of its kind, it was never 
                distributed, the contact number was
                disconnected, and the trail of the 
                person offering the reward was covered

     STARLING TURNS TO PAZZI, HOLDING A CAMERA. SHE HESITATES,
     THEN REALIZES HE WANTS HER TO TAKE HIS PHOTO IN FRONT OF THE
     POSTER. 

                          STARLING
                Yeah, sure.

     PAZZI MOVES IN FRONT OF THE POSTER.  WE SEE THE REFLECTION
     IN THE GLASS FRONTING THE POSTER, AND STARLING MOVES TO
     ELIMINATE IT .

     WE SEE THE GROUP OF KRENDLER, CRAWFORD, ET ALL, BREAK UP, 
     AND BEGIN TO MOVE TOWARD STARLING.  SHE APPROACHES THEM,
     TO HEAR THEIR NEWS.

                Well, then, you have insufficient 
                information.  I'm grateful for this
                opportunity to set you straight.

                Starling.  Old as you are... ain't you 
                ashamed, still lookin' for your Pappy...?

     STARLING WALKS UP TO CRAWFORD, WHO IS LOOKING AT THE FILE. 

                          CRAWFORD 
                ...what has he got against you? 

                          STARLING 
                Why would you say that?  Because he sent
                me in there to be killed...?

     INT GYMNASIUM DAY 

     JOHN BRIGHAM, A BUFF AND ROUGH AND TOUGH MARINE TYPE, IS
     LECTURING TO A GROUP OF RECRUITS.

                          BRIGHAM 
                Big man, little man... Fair fight, the 
                good Big Man's gonna win.  But we don't
                mean to send you out there to fight
                fair... 

     BRIGHAM LOOKS UP.  ANGLE HIS POV.  A DOOR IN THE BACK OF A
     SMALL RAISED BLEACHER SECTION OPENS, AND STARLING COMES IN,
     HOLDING THE FILE, SHE LOOKS DOWN TOWARD BRIGHAM. 

     ANGLE 

     ON BRIGHAM, AS HE NODS AT STARLING, AND THEN RETURNS TO
     ADDRESS HIS GROUP OF STUDENTS.

                          BRIGHAM (cont'd) 
                And, in a gunfight, what just happened 
                to the Big Man?  He's at a disadvantage.
                Inney? 

     HE MOVES TO THE GROUP OF STUDENTS, AND APPROACHES A RATHER
     LARGE YOUNG MAN.

                     HOLSTER) 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE PERUSES THE FILE.  SHE SHAKES HER
     HEAD IN DISGUST.  SHE LOOKS DOWN AT BRIGHAM AND MOUTHS, "I 
     NEED TO SEE YOU..."

     ANGLE, ON BRIGHAM, ON THE MAT, ADDRESSING THE PUPIL, HE NODS 
     BACK, AT STARLING, AND TOUCHES HIS WATCH, AND MIMES, "LATER,

                Now, an arrest?  You aim to shoot me, or
                you just playing show and tell.  You
                don't want to shoot me, you just deprived 
                yourself of one of your hands.  You fool,
                I got two hands, you got one.  So: 
                what's the gun good for?  Force?  No. 
                It's good for control.  You can control
                through force, but you can also control
                through....

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE EXITS, THROUGH THE BACK OF THE 
     GYM. 

     ANGLE.  HOLD ON BRIGHAM, ADDRESSING THE STUDENT, WHO LOOKS
     OVER HIS SHOULDER TOWARD THE DIRECTION OF BRIGHAM'S GAZE.

                a gun at me, looking in the 
                oth'direction, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK
                YOU ARE...? 

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, BACK IN THE CORRIDOR, AS SHE OPENS THE
     FILE, AND LOOKS AT IT AGAIN, AND SHAKES HER HEAD. 

     INT PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE DAY. 

     STARLING IS TALKING TO A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN.

                          WOMAN
                    (PSYCHIATRIST) 
                ..that you went into police work to
                control your rage....

     STARLING STARTS TO LAUGH.

                          STARLING 
                Well, that would be a poor choice,
                wouldn't it... 

                          PSYCHIATRIST
                Tell me why...?

                    (SHAKES HER HEAD, STILL
                     LAUGHING) 
                I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. 
                Because, you know, you can't understand. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST
                Then tell me. 

                          STARLING 
                Well, you know, you know, you know, the
                point is:  I can't tell you.  Cause you 
                haven't been there.  You haven't done it.
                And that's all there is. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                    (PAUSE.  SHE CHECKS HER NOTES) 
                ...and to have done it, means, can mean 
                to accept, not only danger, but 
                betrayal...?

                          STARLING
                ....that's right. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                ..and humiliation?  What is this new 
                job they've...? 

                          STARLING 
                No.  That's right.  That's all part of
                it. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                Then, that being so, why is today 
                special?  Why have you come back to see 
                me?  Is it that new file they gave you? 

                          STARLING
                I don't think so. 

                          PSYCHIATRIST 
                Then what brings you back? 

                          STARLING 
                I don't know.  Do you know...? 

                          PSYCHIATRIST
                Yes.  I think I do. 
                    (PAUSE.  STARLING LOOKS AT
                     HER, AS IF TO SAY, THEN,
                     PLEASE, REVEAL IT)
                I think it is a phrase you used with
                that woman.  You told her you were an
                orphan.
                    (STARLING STARTS SHAKING HER
                     HEAD) 
                You used, to your mind, your most 
                private fears.

                          STARLING
                ...no...

     INT COPBAR NIGHT.

     STARLING IS DRINKING WITH ARDELIA MAPP, A CONTEMPORARY, AND
     ARDELIA'S BOYFRIEND, JIM.  THERE ARE VARIOUS EMPTY BOTTLES
     IN FRONT OF THEM.

     STARLING IS LOOKING DOWN AT THE FILE WE SAW EARLIER, AND
     SCOWLING. 

     MAPP AND JIM LOOK ON.  A WAITRESS COMES BY.

                good... but I already drunk it, so,
                barring that, yes, I would like another. 

     THE WAITRESS EXITS.

     WE SEE BRIGHAM NOTICE STARLING, ET AL, AND EXCUSE HIMSELF.

                No, that is code-word material, that's

                    (SHE STARTS TO LAUGH) 
                I feel they're Out to Get Me... 

                          BRIGHAM 
                And who is "they?" 

                          STARLING
                ...they're sending me.  Out to get
                Shot.  Hounding me.... they're...
                    (PAUSE) 

                          BRIGHAM 
                ...the whole world's out to get you... 

                          STARLING 
                How crazy is that. 

                          BRIGHAM 
                Well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a
                big target... 

                          STARLING
                    (SLEEPILY) 
                How crazy is that....

     ANGLE, INS. ON THE LECHTER FILE, AND THE PHOTO OF HANNIBAL
     LECHTER. 

     WE SEE BRIGHAM PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE PHOTO.
     HOLD, LIGHTS GO OFF. 

     BEAT.  STARLING'S HAND COMES INTO THE FRAME, SWEEPS THE
     LECHTER PHOTO AND FILE ONTO THE FLOOR, AND REPLACES IT WITH
     THE PHOTO OF THE WESTERN GARBED MAN AND THE LITTLE BLONDE
     GIRL. 

     BEAT. 

     THE LIGHT GOES ON AGAIN. 

     WE SEE STARLING SWING TO A SITTING POSITION ON THE COUCH. 
     SHE SIGHS.  SHE SHAKES HER HEAD TO CLEAR IT, AND SHE PULLS
     THE HANNIBAL FILE TO HER.  SHE PICKS UP A PENCIL, AND A PAIR 
     OF READING GLASSES FROM THE TABLE, AND BEGINS MAKING NOTES
     ON THE FILE. 

     ANGLE INS. 

     THE AUCTION CATALOGUE, AN FBI FILE, READING, "SALE OF STOLEN
     HANNIBAL LECHTER MATERIAL."

     EXT VIRGINIA HIGHWAY DAY. 

     STARLING'S FBI SEDAN SPEEDING PAST, ON AN EMPTY COUNTRY ROAD.

     THE CAR PULLS OVER ONTO THE SHOULDER.

     ANGLE INT THE CAR. 

     STARLING, TAKING OUT A MAP.  SHE LOOKS AT THE MAP.  LOOKS 
     AROUND.  SHE THROWS THE CAR INTO REVERSE, AND REVERSES
     SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS QUICKLY. 

     ANGLE INT THE CAR. 

     STARLING LOOKS FROM THE MAP ACROSS THE ROAD.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     A BARELY DISCERNIBLE BREAK IN THE FOLIAGE, BEAT, THEN 
     STARLING' S CAR PULLS ACROSS THE ROAD, AND INTO THE POV AND
     ENTERS THE BREAK. 

     ANGLE EXT THE CAR. 

     EMERGING FROM A THICK WOODS, THE CAR IS HINGED BY THE CAMERA
     ONTO THE PARK OF A COUNTRY ESTATE, THE CAR DISAPPEARS INTO A
     SMALL DIP IN THE LANDSCAPE.

     ANGLE EXT THE CAR, AT A GATEHOUSE, PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN BY THE
     CONTOUR OF THE LAND.  WE SEE A SMALL DECREPIT GATEHOUSE IN
     STONE, AND, BEYOND IT, A FLIMSY AND ANCIENT BARRICADE, AN
     OLD GAMEKEEPER TYPE IN TWEEDS COMES OUT OF THE GUARDHOUSE.
     HE IS CARRYING A MUG OF COFFEE AND HAS A NAPKIN TUCKED INTO
     HIS COLLAR.  HE REMOVES THE NAPKIN AND APPROACHES THE CAR. 

     STARLING FLASHES HER CREDENTIALS TO THE OLD MAN, WHO HOLDS
     A CLIPBOARD. 

                          STARLING 
                Special Agent Clarice Starling, to see
                Mason Verger. 

     THE MAN AMBLES BACK INTO THE GATEHOUSE.

     ANGLE INT THE GATEHOUSE, THE OLD MAN ENTERS, AND CAMERA
     PULLS BACK TO SHOW, IN A ROOM OFF THE MAIN ROOM, THE FIT
     BODYGUARD TYPES, WATCHING STARLING ON A TV MONITOR.  THERE IS
     A RAFT OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT IN THE ROOM, AND A RACK WITH
     SEVERAL ASSAULT RIFLES ON IT.  ONE OF THE GUARDS IS TYPING
     ONTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL.  HE LOOKS AT THE RESULT, AND
     GLANCES UP AT STARLING, ON THE SCREEN, AND NODS "OKAY" TO THE
     OLD MAN.  THE OLD MAN AMBLES OUT TO THE BARRIER, HAVING
     PICKED UP AN OLD CLIPBOARD AT WHICH HE SQUINTS. 

     THEN, SATISFIED, HE RAISES THE BARRIER, AND STARLING'S CAR
     GOES THROUGH.

     EXT A MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY ESTATE HOUSE.

     A POTATOCHIP VAN IS PARKED TO ONE SIDE IN THE WIDE DRIVE.
     AN OLD RETAINER HOLDS OPEN THE DOOR FOR STARLING, AS SHE
     EXITS FROM HER SEDAN, AND HE SHOWS HER INTO A LARGE 
     OPEN MORNING ROOM, IN WHICH WE FIND TWENTY YOUNG CHILDREN
     OF VARIOUS RACES, ROMPING ON A SELECTION OF NEW TOYS. 

     CAMERA TAKES STARLING THROUGH A MODERN KITCHEN, WHERE 
     SEVERAL WHITE UNIFORMED COOKS ARE WORKING HAPPILY, ONE IS
     OPENING A VAST TIN OF POTATOCHIPS.  ONE OF THEM IS REMOVING A
     TRAY OF COOKIES FROM THE OVEN, SEVERAL TYKES WAIT HAPPILY
     NEARBY.  THE COOK WITH THE TRAY OF COOKIES GIVES STARLING
     A WIDE GRIN.

     THE RETAINER TAKES STARLING PAST THE KITCHEN, TO A DOUBLE
     DOOR, WHICH HE OPENS TO REVEAL A CORRIDOR BEYOND, AND A 
     LARGE FIT MAN IN HIS THIRTIES, WEARING AN ORDERLY'S WHITES,
     COMING TOWARD THE CAMERA.

                          CORDELL 
                Agent Starling, would you come with
                me...? 

     CORDELL BOWS TO THE OLD RETAINER, WHO RETIRES.

     CORDELL AND STARLING WALK DOWN THE CORRIDOR.

                          STARLING 
                The children...? 

                          CORDELL 
                ...they're from Baltimore.... 

                          STARLING 
                I've never heard that he... 

                          CORDELL 
                It's not something he wants to 
                publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he
                does. 

     BEAT. 

                          STARLING 
                I won't take much of his time. 

                          CORDELL 
                He's glad to help.  ...it's just a 
                question of his physical condition.  You
                Understand... 

     CAMERA TAKES STARLING DOWN A CORRIDOR LINED WITH
     HUNTINGPRINTS.  AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR AN OLD WOMAN
     SITS IN A WOODEN CHAIR, KNITTING. 

     THEY HAVE STOPPED.  WAITING FOR THE WOMAN TO LOOK UP. 
     STARLING'S GAZE IS DRAWN BY AN OLD, CREWEL-WORK "SAMPLER"
     FRAMED ON THE WALL BY THE OLD WOMAN'S CHAIR.  AND OBVIOUS
     ANTIQUE.  IT READS: 

     "DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY.  DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY."

     ANGLE ON CORDELL AND STARLING, AS STARLING LOOKS AT THE
     SAMPLER, AND THE OLD WOMAN LOOKS UP FROM HER KNITTING. 

     SHE SITS IN FRONT OF A HALF-OPENED DOOR, WHICH WE SEE IS
     THE DOOR TO A LINEN CLOSET.

                          CORDELL (cont'd)
                ...y'get enough breakfast, Rosie...? 

     BEAT.  XCU ON THE OLD WOMAN, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING, AND 
     THEN NODS TO CORDELL, AS IF TO SAY, "THAT IS THE CORRECT 
     CODE."

     ANGLE INS.

     HER HAND DROPS TO THE BACK OF THE WOODEN CHAIR, AND PRESSES 
     A BUTTON CONCEALED IN THE LEG.

     ANGLE 

     THE GROUP IN THE CORRIDOR, THE "LINEN CLOSET," OPENS, TO 
     REVEAL, BEYOND IT, WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SURGICAL FACILITY,
     OR HIGH-TECH HOSPITAL ROOM. 

     INT THE HIGHTECH ROOM.

     THERE IS A NURSE, SITTING AT A STATION, MONITORING VARIOUS
     LIFESIGN DISPLAYS.  SHE LOOKS UP BRIEFLY, AS CORDELL AND
     STARLING ENTER . 

                          NURSE
                    (TO CORDELL) 
                Five minutes... 

     CORDELL NODS, AND TAKES STARLING DEEPER INTO THE ROOM.  WE
     BEGIN TO HEAR THE SUSURRUS OF A MECHANICAL BREATHING
     APPARATUS.  CAMERA GOES WITH STARLING INTO THE ROOM, WHERE WE
     SEE A HOSPITAL BED, WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF IT, AND 
     VARIOUS TELEVISION DISPLAYS ABOVE IT, ANGLED TO BE SEEN FROM
     THE BED. 

     STARLING APPROACHES THE BED, AND LOOKS DOWN AT THE FIGURE
     IN IT.  WE SEE HER FACE, BUT THE FIGURE IS SCREENED.  THE
     FIGURE, VERGER, SPEAKS BREATH BY BREATH, WITH AN OBVIOUS
     ELECTRONIC ENHANCEMENT.

                          VERGER 
                Aren't they beautiful, Miss Starling... 

     STARLING LOOKS UP AT THE CHILDREN PLAYING.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     ONE OF THE CHILDREN FALLS OFF A SMALL PLASTIC SLIDE, AND 
     CRIES, A NURSE RUNS TO HIM.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                Well, now, you see, one of them's hurt.
                And what will make it better?  Love.
                Isn't that odd.
                    (PAUSE) 
                He think's he's hurt his knee--but the 
                assurance, the assurance, the assurance
                that someone cares  (WHEEZE WHEEZE)
                Suggests the hurt was elsewhere. 

                          STARLING 
                Mr. Verger, thank you for your time. 

                          VERGER 
                For the worst hurt, of course, that 
                which will not heal, is the conviction
                no one cares.

                          STARLING 
                I've come to see you, sir, about an
                Auction... 

     SHE HOLDS UP THE CATALOGUE TO HIM.

     ANGLE INS 

     "DRAWINGS AND MEMORABILIA RELATING TO THE SERIAL KILLER, 
     HANNIBAL LECHTER."

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE COMES CLOSE, DONNING SURGICAL GLOVES, AND 
     TAKES THE CATALOGUE, AND HOLDS IT TOWARD VERGER. 

                          VERGER
                Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter...
                And have they sent you, once again to
                capture him?  How terrible for you... 

                          STARLING 
                No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why
                do you say how terrible? 

                          VERGER 
                Because we must leave the past in the
                past.  (WHEEZE WHEEZE) 
                    (CORDELL TURNS A PAGE) 
                Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes,
                my own encounter with him...

     CORDELL TURNS THE PAGE QUICKLY. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                No, no.  That's alright.  Yes.  Lechter's
                drawings of me.  Before... and, of 
                course, after... Now:  you are not sent
                to pursue him.  Then your visit baffles
                me. 

                          STARLING 
                Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. 
                Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the
                prison after his escape, have surfaced 
                and are being sold at auction.  Several
                large reserve bids have been placed on
                them.  I have to ask if you've placed
                those bids. 

                          VERGER
                Because? 

                          STARLING 
                Because if it was not you, then, perhaps
                it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim
                his own property. 

                          VERGER 
                And why would you suspect me, of this
                ghoulishness? 

                          STARLING
                Because, sir, you are the only one of his
                victims who lived.  And because you have 
                large resources. 

                          VERGER 
                Large resources, Starling, which I prefer 
                to devote elsewhere....

     STARLING LOOKS UP, AS WE SEE THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION 
     CHANGE TO THE CHILDREN EATING THE COOKIES, AND THE IMAGE
     CHANGES AGAIN TO SHOW A SMALL DISPENSARY, AND THE KNEE OF THE
     CHILD WHO FELL BEING BANDAIDED BY A NURSE.
 
                          STARLING
                Due respect, sir... 

     SHE PRODUCES A COPY OF THE WANTED:  HANNIBAL LECHTER POSTER
     WE SAW AT THE FBI. 

                          STARLING (cont'd)
                Due respect, after your, after your... 

                          VERGER
                My encounter. 

                          STARLING 
                Someone offered three million dollars
                bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
                    (PAUSE) 

                          CORDELL 
                The identity of the person offering the
                bounty was never established. 

                          VERGER 
                Yes, but we know who it was, and I will
                tell you, Agent Starling, what you know
                to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It
                was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. 
                And I thank God every day that I did not
                compound my sinful life by the stain of
                a murder.  Do you (WHEEZE) Agent
                Starling:  do you know God?
                    (PAUSE) 

                          STARLING
               ...sir...?

                          VERGER 
                Isn't it funny?  You can look on my
                face (WHEEZE WHEEZE) which you would 
                grant me, is the most hideous sight you
                will see in what I hope is a long life. 
                You can look at me.  Which shows (WHEEZE)
                a Strength which must come from strong
                (WHEEZE) strong convictions.  (WHEEZE)
                But you shy when I say the name of
                God. 

     THE NURSE COMES UP, HOLDING THE TAPE OF A LIFESIGNS 
     MACHINE, SHE NODS TO CORDELL AND INDICATES THE MONITORS.

                          NURSE 
                    (TO STARLING)
                ...I'm sorry.. 
                    (MEANING, YOU MUST GO.) 

                          STARLING 
                Yes, then, you're saying that you
                haven't bid upon these drawings.

                          VERGER
                I have not, I would not.  For life
                (WHEEZE) life goes on Starling.  And,
                wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... 
                I'm... (WHEEZE)  (TO THE NURSE, WHO IS 
                TAKING STARLING'S ARM) One moment.  I was
                afflicted, do you see, but my affliction
                was not in my meeting with your Dr.
                Lechter.  I was afflicted before. 
                Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance.
                Do not (WHEEZE) Do not curse God when
                you are humiliated.  Listen to me:
                embrace it, and you embrace life....
                Listen, and you hear the word of
                God... 

     STARLING IS LED AWAY BY THE CONCERNED NURSE.  CORDELL LINGERS
     BEHIND, AT AN UNSEEN BEHEST OF VERGER. 

     THE NURSE STARTS PREPARING A HYPO AT HER STATION.

                          STARLING 
                ...will he be alright...? 

     THE NURSE, DISTRACTED, NODS, AND RETREATS TOWARD VERGER
     WITH THE HYPO.

     CORDELL COMES OUT TO STARLING.

     INT CORRIDOR, COUNTRY HOUSE, DAY.  STARLING AND CORDELL ARE 
     WALKING, BEYOND THEM, WE SEE VARIOUS CHILDREN PLAYING UNDER
     ADULT SUPERVISION.  A CARETAKER TYPE IS HOLDING A SMALL
     GOAT, WHICH THE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING WITH. 

     CORDELL OPENS THE GLASS DOOR, AND HE WALKS STARLING THROUGH
     THE SCENE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE GOAT. 

                          CORDELL 
                Mr. Verger wanted me to give you 
                this... 
                    (HE HANDS HER A SMALL PRINTED CARD) 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE GLANCES AT THE CARD.

     ANGLE INS THE CARD READS:

     "DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY..." 

     SHE GLANCES AT IT, AND, DISMISSIVELY, PUTS IT IN A POCKET.

                          CORDELL (cont'd) 
                And he has asked me to ask you something. 

                          STARLING 
                What would that be? 

                          CORDELL 
                    (PAUSE)
                He... would consider it a favor if he 
                could make a donation.  To a charitable
                institution of your choice.
                    (PAUSE) 

                          STARLING 
                Now, why in the world would he do that? 

                          CORDELL 
                I... think... he was.... he was 
                touched, by your reaction.  To his
                appearance. 

                          STARLING
                What reaction? 

                          CORDELL
                Exactly. 

                          STARLING 
                    (AS SHE HANDS HIM A CARD) 
                Please, I do not... I don't want to 
                trouble him.  But if you or he have any 
                notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...

                Starling:  They got a x-ray.  They think,

     A NICE MODERN SMALL APARTMENT.  ANNA PAZZI, A VERY BEAUTIFUL
     WOMAN OF AROUND THIRTY IS STANDING IN THE HALL, AS PAZZI

     HE STOPS, AND RUMMAGES IN HIS CASE, AND BRINGS OUT A 
     BOTTLE OF PERFUME.  HE GIVES IT TO HER.  SHE LOOKS
     DISAPPOINTED.

     THEY HAVE ARRIVED ON A LANDING.  VARIOUS RESTORATION CREWS

                in his Non-Italian-Hand, a note, from
                Dante Aligheri himself.  Would he
                recognize it, I think not...

                You want the job for your nephew.

                Yes, fine, of course he can read the
                note.  His Italian is admirable, for a
                straniero.  But is he familiar with... 

     ANGLE 

     ON THE MAN, PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN OF WHOM THEY ARE TALKING.

     MAGNIFICENT SUIT, USING HALF-GLASSES TO LOOK DOWN AT A NOTE

                What if he came upon a note in, the 
                Capponi Library, this great Italian 
                Institution, which he now graces us with
                his bid to Direct, a note from Guido de
                Cavalcanti.  Would he recognize it, I
                think not. 

     ANGLE ON DR. FELL, STILL SEEN FROM THE REAR, AS HE TAKES A
     SILK SQUARE FROM HIS BREAST POCKET, AND CLEANS HIS HALF-
     GLASSES, THEN FOLDS THEM AND PUTS THEM AND THE SQUARE BACK
     IN HIS POCKET. 

                          SOGLIATO (cont'd)
                    (VO) 
                Would you care to address that, Dr.
                Fell...? 

     BEAT.  DR. FELL TURNS TO CAMERA, STILL HOLDING THE NOTE. 

     HE TAKES SEVERAL PACES, TO LOOK AT THE NOTE IN A SHAFT OF
     SUNLIGHT.
 
     HE IS STANDING BESIDE THE STATUE OF JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES. 
     HE NODS AT THE NOTE, AS IF CONFIRMING SOMETHING.  THEN HE 
     LOOKS UP. 

                          DR. FELL 
                Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's 
                first sonnet.  Do you know it, Professor
                Sogliato?  I believe it's worth your 
                time:  Listen to the way he makes an
                instrument of the Italian vernacular, 
                which he called the vulgari eloquentia--
                the eloquent voice of the people: 
                Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core
                in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna
                involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la 
                svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa 
                umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea 
                paingendo.  If Dante had written to a 
                Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have 
                been to Andrea, the most literary of his 
                brothers....

                          SOGLIATO
                ...why do you want this job?

                          DR. FELL 
                In the hope, that someday, I should come
                across such a note.  I thank you 
                gentleman for your kind attention, and
                hope you will consider...

                I never met him.  I knew him only from

                          PAZZI 
                I know that the officers who first 
                investigated his disappearance searched

                It is only temporary, until my

                Of course, in his offices, if you come

                his, anything, however trivial, would
                you contact me, please... Are his

                          FELL 
                Yes.  Packed and with an inventory.

     PAZZI AND FELL WALK OUT OF THE MUSEUM.

     ANGLE EXT THE MUSEUM. 

                          PAZZI 
                I'll have them picked up.

     PAZZI GESTURES TO HIS COLLEAGUE. 

                          PAZZI (cont'd)
                May we drop you? 

                          FELL 
                Thank you, I am most happy to walk in
                this most magnificent of cities. 

     FELL STARTS PULLING ON HIS GLOVES, HE HANDS HIS SKETCHBOOK 
     TO PAZZI FOR A MOMENT.  PAZZI LOOKS DOWN.

     ANGLE PAZZI'S POV 

     FELL'S LEFT HAND, HAS A SCAR ON THE BACK IN THE SHAPE OF A 
     3. 

                               PAZZI 
                May I ask you a personal question, Dr.

                               FELL 
                If your duty requires it. 

                               PAZZI 
                You have a recent scar on the back of 
                your hand.

                               PAZZI 
                You looked oddly at me, back on the
                landing. 

                               FELL 
                Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman.
                Is it hard?  Must one, then, be
                constantly suspicious? 

                               PAZZI 
                Why did you look at me that way?

                    (SMILES) 
                I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but
                clean.  Just dressed--in the middle of 
                the... 

     FELL SHAKES HIS HEAD, ASKING TO HAVE THE QUESTION
     WITHDRAWN.

                               PAZZI

                    (SHRUGS, SMILES) 
                I saw a man, somewhat fatigued.
                Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In
                the middle of the day.
                    (SMILES)
                An old story.  And then I saw the 
                clothing was fresh--therefore:  a man who 
                dressed at home.  And then I remarked
                the new wedding ring.  And so:  the 
                story gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A 
                new, and a beloved wife.  I wish you joy.

     PAZZI WALKS WITH HIM. 

                          PAZZI 
                You assemble this, on the instant, from
                these few observations? 

                          FELL
                    (SHRUGS) 
                I'm a historian.  It is our task to 
                assemble the seemingly unconnected into 
                the obvious. 

                          PAZZI
                ...your scar..? 

                          FELL 
                My scar is a war-wound. 

                          PAZZI
                How so? 

                          FELL 
                Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of 
                typing.  Commendatore.  History,
                a hazardous profession. 

     FELL AND THEN PAZZI STOP.

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                You are a Pazzi of the Pazzim are you
                not? 

                          PAZZI 
                Yes.  How did you know? 

                          FELL 
                You resemble a figure from the Della 
                Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at
                Santa Croce. 

                          PAZZI
                It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John
                the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel? 

                          FELL 
                I have had the honor. 
                    (HE BOWS AND STARTS OFF.
                     PAZZI GOES AFTER HIM.) 

     FELL TURNS TO HIM. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                I wondered that an officer of your 
                exalted rank should come, so late,
                into the case. 

                          PAZZI
                And?  Then? 

                          FELL 
                I wonder no longer.  You were out of the
                country. 

                          PAZZI 
                How could you know? 

                          FELL
                I sense... 
                    (HE TOUCHES HIS NOSE) 
                The faintest whiff of a perfume, whose
                base, whose base, whose base is 
                "Hamamelis" ... it is witch-hazel--such 
                a clean scent.  No, not a European scent.
                I would say it is a scent of the New
                World.  I would say, you have been in
                America.  Have I struck home? 

                          PAZZI 
                You know America? 

                          FELL 
                ...you have brought this perfume... 
                brought this perfume.  Back.  Back from
                America.  To your New Wife... 
                    (HE PICKS UP HIS HAND, AND 
                     GLANCES DOWN AT PAZZI'S
                     WEDDING RING.) 
                You have given it to her, and some of...
                    (HE SMILES) 
                Some of 'her perfume' has found its way
                back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man,
                indeed. 

     HE BOWS, AND STARTS TO TAKE HIS LEAVE, FROM THE STARTLED
     PAZZI.  PAZZI COMES TO HIS SENSES, AND HANDS A CARD TO FELL. 

                          PAZZI 
                Should you come across anything which... 

                          FELL 
                You will be the first I call. 

     FELL TURNS TO LEAVE, TURNS BACK, AND TAKES HIS HAND AND,
     GENTLY RUBS IT ON THE LAPEL OF PAZZI'S SUITJACKET, HE THEN,
     DELICATELY, HOLDS THE HAND UNDER HIS NOSE, AND NODS, AS IF
     IN AGREEMENT WITH HIMSELF. 

     HE NODS, AND WALKS OFF INTO A PARK. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, WHO LOOKS AFTER FELL.  HE WALKS BACK TOWARD
     THE CAR.  HE TURNS, TO LOOK AFTER FELL, AND WE SEE HE IS
     STANDING BY A LINE OF PEOPLE, A QUEUE, UNDER A BANNER WHICH
     PROCLAIMS, "ATROCIOUS INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE." 

     PAZZI SHAKES HIS HEAD, AS IF TO CLEAR IT, AND STARTS TOWARD
     HIS CAR, WHERE COP ONE OPENS THE OOOR FOR HIM. 

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, AS CAMERA TAKES HIM INTO THE PARK, WHICH, WE SEE,
     IS A CEMETERY. 

     HE SITS ON A BENCH, AND TAKES OUT HIS SKETCHBOOK, AND BEGINS
     TO DRAW. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     A PIECE OF FUNERAY STATUARY, THE LION, HOLDING THE BIRD IN
     HIS MOUTH. 

     ANGLE ON DR. FELL, SKETCHING.  TIGHT. 

     HE SKETCHES, HE RAISES HIS HAND TO HIS NOSE AND INHALES, AND
     NODS AGAIN. 

     ANGLE, FROM THE SIDE, WE NOW SEE THE STATUE AND FELL'S
     DRAWING.  HE IS DRAWING, NOT THE STATUE, BUT A SKETCH OF
     CLARICE STARLING. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

     AN ARMY FATIGUE JACKET OVER ORDERLY'S WHITES.  (BARNEY) 

     ANGLE 

     STARLING, STANDING AT A BUSSTOP, READING A PAPER.

     ANGLE INS. 

     IN THE PAPER IS SECRETED A PHOTO OF BARNEY, ON FBI XEROX 
     FORM, WITH HIS NAME, AND DESCRIPTION.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING WAITS AT THE BUSSTOP.  BARNEY PASSES IN FRONT OF 
     HER, AND CONTINUES WALKING.  STARLING FOLDS THE PAPER AND
     GOES AFTER HIM. 

     ANGLE 

     RUNDOWN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, DAY. 

     BARNEY, NOW HOLDING A SMALL BAG OF GROCERIES, CROSSES THE 
     STREET. 

     WE SEE STARLING IN THE BG. 

     BARNEY STOPS, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.  WE SEE HE IS 
     LOOKING UP OVERHEAD.

     ANGLE INS HIS POV. 

     A DOVE, CIRCLING IN THE SKY.

     ANGLE XCU.

     BARNEY LOOKING UP, PUZZLED, AND THEN HE LOOKS DOWN.

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     IN THE ROAD AHEAD, A DEAD DOVE. 

     BARNEY WALKS INTO THE POV, PICKS UP THE DOVE, AND WALKS TO A
     SMALL RATTY VERGE OF PARK.  HE PUTS THE DOVE DOWN, LOVINGLY
     IN THE GRASS, AND WE WATCH, AS THE OTHER DOVE LANDS ON A
     FENCE, NEARBY. 

     BARNEY STARTS TO WALK TOWARD THE LIVE BIRD.

     ANGLE 

     OVER THE BIRD, ONTO BARNEY, WITH STARLING WALKING UP BEHIND 
     HIM. 

     BARNEY HESITATES, HIS BACK STILL TO STARLING.

                          BARNEY 
                Are you attracted by Death?
                    (PAUSE) 
                It is the one great mystery, is it not? 
                Anyone who would say otherwise must be a
                hypocrite.  Don't you think...? 

     HE TURNS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND LOOKS AT HER. 

                          BARNEY (cont'd) 
                ...or are you only attracted by power...
                    (HE CHANGES HIS TACK AND TONE.) 
                How are you, Agent Starling? 

                          STARLING 
                Ah, Barney:  you've got a good mernory. 

                          BARNEY 
                You know why that is?  Because there
                are so few things I need to forget. 
                Would you agree, for the record, that I
                have not been read my rights? 

                          STARLING 
                I have not read you your rights. 

                          BARNEY 
                Would you mind saying that into your
                bag...? 

     STARLING STARTS TO OPEN HER BAG, AND SPEAKS INTO IT.

                          STARLING
                I hereby acknowledge that... 

                          BARNEY 
                And now I have "dociled" you, have I
                not?  By forcing your obedience. 

                          STARLING 
                    (SMILING) 
                Then why did you chose to inform me of
                it...? 

                          BARNEY
                To show... 
                    (PAUSE) 
                in my ability to squander.  What one
                might deem an advantage... that my
                strength is greater than yours... 

                          STARLING 
                Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...? 

                          BARNEY 
                If you'll come down the street I will
                make you a cup of coffee. 

     INT BARNEY'S APARTMENT DAY. 

     AS THEY ENTER, THE APARTMENT WITH MANY DEADBOLTS.  STARLING 
     ENTERS WARILY AND TAKES A SEAT WITH HER BACK TO THE WALL, IN
     THE SMALL STUDIO. 

     AS BARNEY BEGINS MAKING COFFEE.

                          BARNEY 
                You almost took down Evelda Drumgo.

                          STARLING 
                Well.  Word gets around. 

                          BARNEY 
                ...what hindered you...? 

                          STARLING
                It wasn't my day. 

                          BARNEY 
                Perhaps you did not have the support
                you required.

                          STARLING 
                It's a poor workman who blames his tools. 

                          BARNEY
                Or, perhaps... 

                          STARLING 
                ...how are things at the Hospital? 

                          BARNEY 
                It's a growth business. 

                          STARLING
                What have they got you doing? 

                          BARNEY
                Orderly. 

                          STARLING 
                I would have figured you an R.N. by now,
                or, maybe Med School. 

                          BARNEY 
                I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous
                professions. 

                          STARLING 
                    (TAKES OUT A NOTEBOOK) 
                You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in 
                Dr. Lechter's prison ward. 

                          BARNEY 
                Yes, I presumed it was about him. 

                          STARLING 
                ...you... 

                          BARNEY 
                I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did 
                not last with him.  I was privileged to
                enjoy his company during that time. 

                          STARLING 
                    (GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS, AS
                     SHE TAKES OUT A PENCIL.)
                I'm looking for... 

                          BARNEY 
                He said, and these were his words, he 
                valued our time together, because I was
                civil. 

                          STARLING 
                Did you ever think, did you think, after
                he escaped, he would come after you? 

                          BARNEY 
                He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude.
                Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think
                he'd come after you...? 

     STARLING LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW.

     ANGLE HER POV 

     OUT THE WINDOW, SE SEE THE DOVE CIRCLING THE DEAD DOVE ON THE 
     RATTY PIECE OF GRASS.

                          STARLING
                    (TURNING BACK)
                What...? 

                          BARNEY 
                I asked you how you like your coffee...? 
                We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of
                Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world-

                We got a bunch of materials, coming up 
                at auction.  Materials which disappeared
                from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he 
                made, his books.

                          BARNEY 
                Yes? 

                          STARLING 
                And I'd like your help, determining
                who's bidding for their purchase. 

                          BARNEY
                Why me? 

                          STARLING 
                Waal, because your selling'em... Two 
                years ago, his annotated Dictionary of
                Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for
                sixteen thousand dollars.
                Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed
                Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like
                an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? 
                Ten, twelve grand? 

                          BARNEY
                ...very good. 

                          STARLING 
                Here's what they want you to do:  we 
                want the rest of the stuff you stole from
                his cell. 

                          BARNEY

                collectibles...

                You said "here's what they want you to
                do..."  Why?

                Now, whyn't you help us? 

                          BARNEY 
                That would adversely impact my income. 

                          STARLING 
                Not as much as being jailed for theft of
                Government Property, or for failure to
                pay income tax, on undisclosed income. 

                          BARNEY
                We could skip the Gavotte. 

                          STARLING

                          BARNEY 
                You said "here's what they want you
                to do."  Aren't you part of them 
                anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI?
                'No Girl's Allowed,' or what?  Have you
                transgressed...?

                          STARLING 
                And why is it a vacant exercise? 

                          BARNEY 
                Because we both know who's buying the
                Lechteriana.

                Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it
                mirrors his soul, what an impossible
                injustice.  Can you be free....? 

                          STARLING 
                No, you're wrong about Verger.

     ANGLE SHIFT TO OVER VERGER, ONTO THE FRIGHTENED BOY.  IN THE
     BG WE SEE THE NURSE BEATING A STRATEGIC RETREAT TO THE DOOR,
     AND AFTER HER EXIT, WE SEE HER APPEAR ON THE SCREEN WHICH
     SHOWS THE CORRIDOR, TAKING A CHAIR ACROSS FROM "ROSIE," WE
     SEE HER SIT AND TAKE OUT A BOOK AND READ.  AS VERGER TALKS
     WITH FRANKLIN, WE SEE THE INFORMATION ON THE "TEXT" SCREEN
     SCROLL, WHICH NEW INFO WE SEE REFLECTED IN VERGER'S
     QUESTIONS. 

                          FRANKLIN (cont'd) 
                But Stringbean, he in and out.

                          VERGER 
                In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama,
                is not your real Mama, is she Franklin? 

                          FRANKLIN
                She my foster. 

                          VERGER 
                She's not the first foster that you've
                had.  Is she? 

                          FRANKLIN
                No. 
                    (THE CHILD LOOKS AROUND, AND,
                     FINDING NO SUPPORT, LOOKS
                     BACK AT VERGER.) 

                          VERGER 
                Do you like it at your home, Franklin? 

                          FRANKLIN
                    (FRIGHTENING) 
                We got KittyKat... 

                          VERGER
                Yes.... yes... 

                          FRANKLIN 
                ...and Shirly, let me sleep with her
                sometime. 

                          VERGER 
                Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there
                anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and
                Kittykat.  You have to go away. 

                          FRANKLIN
                ...who say...? 

                          VERGER 
                The government says.  Mama has lost her
                job, so she can't be your foster 
                mother.  The police found a marijuana 
                cigarette in your home.  You can't see
                Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty 
                Cat.  That's what the Government says... 

     ANGLE XCU ON FRANKLIN. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ...or perhaps they just don't want you
                anymore.  Could that be?  And, do you 
                know what will happen to Kitty Cat?  When
                you go away.  The police will take her,
                and they'll give her a shot.  With a 
                shiny needle.  They'll give Kitty Cat a
                shot.  And it will hurt her.  And then
                she will die. 

     FRANKLIN TAKES THE TAIL OF HIS SHIRT FROM HIS PANTS AND
     HOLDS IT TO HIS EYES. 

     ANGLE 

     ON VERGER'S BED, AND ON CORDELL BEHIND HIM, GLANCING THROUGH
     A FILE. 

     CORDELL LOOKS UP AT THE WAILING OF FRANKLIN. 

                          VERGER (cont'd)
                Come here...
                    (BEAT.
                     FRANKLIN COMES FORWARD, HIS 
                     FACE SCREWING UP IN TERROR AS 
                     THE DETAIL OF VERGER BECOME
                     MORE APPARENT.  HE STOPS
                     MOVING FORWARD.) 
                Do you know how you keep kittycat from
                getting a shot?  Franklin?  No?  Do you
                know.  Then come here... 

     FRANKLIN COMES FORWARD.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                You can keep Kitty Cat from
                getting a shot if... 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO REACTS TO SOME SIGN FROM VERGER, AND NODS,
     AND TAKES A SMALL PACKAGE FROM A POCKET IN HIS COAT.

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO GIVES THE PACKAGE TO FRANKLIN.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                If you give him this... 

     ANGLE ON FRANKLIN, AS HE LOOKS DOWN AT THE PACKAGE IN HIS
     HANDS. 

     ANGLE INS: 

     IT IS A PACKAGE OF RAT POISON.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, HOLDING THE POISON, HE LOOKS UP AS VERGER 
     TALKS. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                You can keep her from getting the shot,
                if you give her that rat poison
                yourself... 

     ANGLE, HOLD ON FRANKLIN, WHO BEGINS TO WEEP COPIOUSLY. 

     ANGLE, ON THE VIDEO SCREEN SHOWING FRANKLIN, AS WE HEAR A
     SERVO MOTOR, AND THE SCREEN ZOOMS IN TO SHOW A TEAR. 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, WHO IS NOW AT A SMALL WETBAR, MIXING VODKA AND
     VERMOUTH AND POURING THEM INTO A MARTINI SHAKER. 

     HE GLANCES OVER, AND NODS. 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE PUSHES A BUTTON ON A CONSOLE.  ON THE
     SCREEN OVER VERGER'S BED WE SEE THE NURSE IN THE HALL
     REACT.  SHE PUTS HER PAPERBACK BOOK INTO HER POCKET, AND
     RISES, AND WE SEE HER ENTER VERGER'S ROOM, AND STAND BY
     THE DOOR. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                Goodbye, Franklin. 

     CORDELL WALKS FRANKLIN TO THE DOOR.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ...remember what we talked about.

     WE HEAR VERGER'S ELECTRONICALLY AMPLIFIED BREATHING BECOME
     EXCITED, AND ON THE LIFESIGNS SCREENS, WE SEE HIS VITAL
     SIGNS BECOME MORE AGITATED, AND THE NURSE, AND CORDELL
     START TOWARD THE BED. 

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                    (AS HIS BREATHING QUIETS)
                No, I'm fine... 

     WE SEE CORDELL START BACK INTO THE ROOM, AND THEN, AT THE
     SOUND OF VERGER'S VOICE TURN AWAY AGAIN. 

     ANGLE, AT THE DOOR, CORDELL SIGNS TO THE NURSE, AND
     STOOPS TO THE CRYING FRANKLIN. 

     CORDELL TAKES A STERILE PLASTIC BAG FROM HIS POCKET, HE
     REMOVES FROM IT A CLAMP, IN THE JAWS OF WHICH ARE A SMALL
     SQUARE OF COTTON GAUZE.  HE STOOPS TO FRANKLIN, AND
     CAREFULLY TAKES ONE OF FRANKLIN'S TEARS ONTO THE GAUZE.  HE
     NODS TO THE NURSE, WHO EXITS WITH FRANKLIN. 

     HE DISAPPEARS FROM THE SHOT.

     ANGLE ON VERGER.

                          VERGER (cont'd) 
                ..what have we heard from our friend at
                the FBI...? 

     ANGLE ON CORDELL, AS HE TAKES AN ENVELOPE, AND EXTRACTS A
     XEROX OF AN X-RAY AND PUTS IT ON THE SCREEN, WE SEE IT IS
     THE "BRAZILIAN" X-RAY OF LECHTER'S HAND.  WE SEE AN IMPRINT
     AT THE TOP OF THE X-RAY--THE PATIENTS NAME AND THE LAB
     NAME RIPPED AWAY--ALL THAT REMAINS ARE THE WORDS "...DO
     BRAZIL." 

                          CORDELL 
                Most current information shows the 
                result of an operation for the removal 
                of a sixth digit, the left hand of a man. 

                          VERGER 
                Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter? 

                          CORDELL 
                Not with any certainty we... 

     VERGER'S BREATHING AGAIN BECOMES EXCITABLE.

                          VERGER 
                Why did he come back?

                           CORDELL 
                Our operatives in Brazil have been
                empowered to offer a reward of....

                          VERGER 
                ...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY
                TURN BACK...? 

                          CORDELL
                ...are you alright, sir...? 

                          VERGER 
                HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have
                we Seen it Before. 

                          CORDELL
                Seen what, sir..? 

                          VERGER 
                The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the
                ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why?
                Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT 
                THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS.
                IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. 
                THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As
                Lechter will return back.  You see?  To
                the sight of his oppressor wounded.
                He will return to savage our beloved Miss
                Starling.  Bring me a drink. 

     CORDELL TURNS, BACK TO THE CONSOLE.

     WE SEE CORDELL TURN, AND APPROACH THE BED, HOLDING THE
     MARTINI ON A TRAY. 

     HE PUTS THE TRAY DOWN ON THE BEDTABLE.

     ANGLE INS. 

     WE SEE, ON THE SMALL METAL HOSPITAL TRAY, THE MARTINI SHAKER, 
     THE MARTINI GLASS, AND A SMALL BEAKER, IN WHICH IS THE CLAMP
     WHICH BEARS THE GAUZE PAD WHICH BEARS FRANKLIN'S TEARS.

     CORDELL SHAKES THE SHAKER, POURS IT INTO THE GLASS, AND
     DROPS THE GAUZE PAD INTO IT, AND HANDS IT TO VERGER. 

                          CORDELL
                Your drink, sir. 

                          VERGER 
                It's time to step up the pressure on
                our Sweet Miss Starling.  ...call our 
                friend at the F.B.I.  And, instead of 
                finding Lechter, let's help Him find us. 

     ANGLE 

     ON ONE OF THE VIDEO SCREENS, WE SEE A SHEET LABELLED
     "CONFIDENTIAL FBI NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION."  AND WE SEE, IN 
     VARIOUS SQUARES BELOW, THE DRAWINGS BY LECHTER, THE VARIOUS
     FUNERAY SKETCHES. 

     CAMERA COMES IN ON ONE OF THE MIDDLE, LEFT, WHICH SHOWS THE
     LION WITH A BIRD IN ITS MOUTH. 

     EXT FLORENCE PARK NIGHT. 

     THE STATUE OF THE LION HOLDING THE BIRD.  A COUPLE WALKING
     PAST.

                ...the purpose of the exercise... is it
                because they are expensive... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                They aren't expensive, you got them
                through your connections.... speaking of
                which: 

                          PAZZI 
                Fine, thank you, but 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Speaking of which, I want you also to
                get us tickets for the Opera... 

                          PAZZI 
                ...whatever is within my power... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...and that is what you need to expand. 

                          PAZZI 
                I don't understand. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                    (SHE STOPS AND ADDRESSES HIM) 
                We are here on sufferance.  I am here... 

                          PAZZI 
                ...why are we here in the first place...? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Because it is exclusive... because
                everyone will be here... 

     CAMERA TAKES THEM PAST A SIGN ANNOUNCING "EXHIBITION
     INSTRUMENTS OF ATROCIOUS TORTURE," AND A VELVET ROPE, AND
     VARIOUS WELL DRESSED PEOPLE WAITING TO GET IN. 

     PAZZI WALKS TO THE HEAD OF THE LINE, AND SHOWS HIS TICKETS,
     AND IS ADMITTED. 

     ANGLE INT.  THE EXHIBIT HALL. 

     AN IRON MAIDEN.  A COFFIN SHOWING SPIKES ON ONE SIDE, THE
     OTHER SIDE EMPTY, IS AN IMPROVISED ENTRY TO THE EXHIBIT. 
     PAZZI AND HIS WIFE ENTER, SHE STOPS TO GOSSIP WITH A WELL
     DRESSED COUPLE. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd) 
                Mrs. Demetrio, how good to see you... 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, AS HE DRIFTS AWAY.  WE SEE HIM STARING AT
     VARIOUS THUMBSCREWS, A RACK, A GUILLOTINE.  HE STOOPS TO READ
     A PLACARD.  HIS WIFE COMES UP BEHIND HIM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd)
                You see, that is my point. 

                          PAZZI
                ...my love... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...they asked us to dinner.  How can we
                accept if we cannot return the... 

                          PAZZI 
                I am on the track of... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand 
                dollars reward, which you would have to
                split with your team, which, if you get
                it, will not buy me a new watch...
                    (SHE STOPS TO GREET ANOTHER COUPLE) 

                          PAZZI 
                ...what do you expect me to... 

     HE STOPS, AND TURNS AWAY, WHEN HE SEES THAT SHE IS 
     ENGROSSED.  HE IS NOW LOOKING AT A TORTURE WHEEL.  HE 
     STOPS AND LOOKS INTENTLY INTO THE GLOOM OF THE ROPED OFF
     EXHIBIT. 

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     INSIDE THE EXHIBIT, IN A DARK CORNER, THE FIGURE OF A MAN.
     SKETCHING. 

     ANGLE XCU ON FELL, LECHTER, IN THE GLOOM, SKETCHING. 

     WE SEE A GOOD SKETCH OF THE WHEEL, ON WHICH HE HAS ADDED
     ARCHITECTURAL NOTES ON ANGLES AND DISTANCES.  HE TURNS,
     FEELING SOMEONE LOOKING AT HIM. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     PAZZI, BEYOND THE VELVET ROPE.  PEERING INTENTLY, RETURNING
     FELL'S GLANCE. 

     DOUBLECUTTING:  WE RETURN TO PAZZI, STARING, WE SEE HIM MAKE
     A QUICK ADDENDUM TO THE SKETCH OF THE TORTURE WHEEL.  AND
     THEN RETURN TO PAZZI, LEANING OVER TO PEER MORE CLOSELY
     INTO THE GLOOM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                So, the question:  as always, Rinaldo,
                the question is one of mmm... 

     ANGLE 

     ON MRS. PAZZI, AS FELL APPEARS AT THEIR SIDE, SHE TURNS TO
     HIM. 

                          FELL
                Commendatore would you do me the honor of
                introducing me. 

                          PAZZI 
                Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi. 

                          FELL 
                    (HE BENDS TO KISS HER HAND)
                Enchante. 

                          GUIDE
                The exhibit is closing.  The exhibit is
                closing in Ten Minutes... please make
                your way to the... 

                          MRS. PAZZI
                Dr. Fell.  You are not Italian. 

                          FELL 
                Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one
                of the few things in life which study
                and a pleasant attitude can not amend.
                What do you think? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                And how do we account for the interest
                of such a charming man, an interest in
                Torture? 

                          PAZZI 
                Dr. Fell is studying for his examination
                by the Studiolo. 

                          FELL 
                Indeed I am.  And the connection, 
                between Dante, and, in fact, between 
                your illustrious forebears... if you'd
                come with me, I could show you... 

     HE HOLDS UP THE ROPE, AS TO LEAD THEM BACK INTO THE
     EXHIBIT. 

                          PAZZI
                But the exhibit is closing. 

                          FELL 
                How unfortunate. 

     PAZZI STARTS TO HELP HIS WIFE ON WITH HER WRAP.

                          FELL (cont'd)
                May I...? 

     HE TAKES THE WRAP, AND BEGINS TO DRAPE IT AROUND HER
     SHOULDERS.

     ANGLE EXT THE EXHIBIT.  ON THE STREET, THE CURIOUS ARE
     EXITING. 

     FELL CONCLUDES PUTTING THE WRAP ON MRS. PAZZI. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                What a lovely perfume.  I believe I
                recognize it, do I not...? 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                My husband brought it to me from 
                America. 

                          FELL 
                A wonderful country... 

     AN OLDER MAN CALLS PAZZI AWAY. 

                          MRS. PAZZI
                You know it? 

                          FELL 
                I have had many excellent meals there.

                          PAZZI 
                No.  Invite us?  No, he simply... 

                          MRS. PAZZI
                Then we cannot go. 

                          PAZZI

                          MRS. PAZZI

                          PAZZI

     MRS. PAZZI TAKES THE FOLDER AND FLINGS IT DOWN.

                It's a joke.  You're a joke.  You're a

     FRONT OF HIM.  HE RESUMES PLAYING. 

     ANGLE HIS POV

     HIM DO EARLIER OF STARLING.  WE SEE HIS HAND ADJUST THE PAGES
     ONCE AGAIN, AND THE SKETCH OF STARLING IS HALF-OBSCURED BY
     THE SKETCH WE SAW FELL MAKE OF THE TORTURE WHEEL.  AT THE
     TOP OF THE SKETCH WE SEE THE ADDED FACES OF PAZZI AND MME
     PAZZI, SKETCHED BY FELL AT THE EXHIBIT. 

     ANGLE 

     FRONTAL ON FELL, AS HE STOPS PLAYING.  HE PICKS UP A GLASS OF
     WINE WHICH HAS BEEN RESTING ON THE CLAVIER, AND TAKES ONE OF

     STARLING IS MOVING THROUGH THE BUILDING, AGAINST THE WALL,
     HUGGING THE WALL.  SHE HEARS A SOUND, AND TURNS.  SHE LOOKS 
     DOWN. 

     ANGLE HER POV--A SMALL BADGE WITH A BULLETHOLE IN IT, LYING
     ON THE FLOOR.  SHE LOOKS UP TO THE SOUND OF RUNNING, AND SEES 
     A FIGURE FLITTING ACROSS AN OPENING. 

     ANGLE 

     STARLING RAISES HER PISTOL AND PULLS THE TRIGGER. 

     NOTHING HAPPENS.  SHE LOOKS AT THE PISTOL.  IT IS JAMMED, SHE 
     TRIES TO CLEAR IT QUICKLY, WE SEE A HAND ON HER SHOULDER, SHE
     TURNS. 

     ANGLE HER POV 

     IT IS THE FACE OF LECHTER. 

     STARLING RAISES THE PISTOL AND FIRES.  WE SEE THE PISTOL 
     EXPLODE. 

     WE HEAR SCREAMING. 

     ANGLE INT STARLING'S BEDROOM.  STARLING, SITTING UP IN BED, 
     SCREAMING.  MAPP BURST IN TO THE ROOM.  FOLLOWED BY HER
     BOYFRIEND, JIM, WHO CARRIES A GUN, AND SWEEPS THE ROOM.  MAPP
     SITS BY STARLING. 

     SHE QUIETS STARLING.

                coffee, cause I'm going to work.

     TELEPHONE, AND TOUCHES SOME BUTTONS ON THE CONSOLE.  WE SEE
     ONE OF THE VIDEO SCREENS COME TO LIFE, AND WE SEE A BARN,
     AND A COUPLE OF RATTY LOOKING GENTLEMEN WITH COFFEECUPS.

                come on the whistle, and to attack the
                figurine. 

     WE SEE THE OTHER GENTLEMEN BRING FORWARD A SCARECROW.

     THE GENTLEMAN BLOWS HIS WHISTLE.  THE PIGS RUN AT THE
     FIGURINE AND STOP.  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF HUMAN SCREAMS. 

                          GENTLEMAN

                We don't want the man consumed.  No.  We
                want to put the man's feet through the 
                bars, and have the pigs... and have the
                pigs eat his feet.

                the orphan... 

                          STARLING 
                Give it up, Evelda.

                          EVELDA 
                You said you din' have no friends--but
                I'm your friend--  I understand you....

     SHE WITHDRAWS A HAND FROM THE BABYSLING, SHOWING A SMALL
     PISTOL, WHICH SHE LEVELS AT STARLING. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING AS SHE FIRES AT EVELDA.  SHE RUNS FORWARD, AND
     TAKES THE SCREAMING BABY FROM EVELDA'S ARMS.  THE BABY IS
     COVERED IN BLOOD. 

     STARLING RUNS TO THE STILL RUNNING HOSE WHICH THE FISH
     WORKER DROPPED, AND SLUICES DOWN THE BABY. 

     SOUND OF HELICOPTER.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS UP.

     ANGLE HER POV.

     THE HELICOPTER SHOWS A CAMERAMAN HANGING OUT OF THE DOOR ON
     A SLING, AND THE LOGO WCTU, TV 10.

     A TELEVISION SCREEN, SHOWING THE SHOT FROM THE HELICOPTER.
     SCREEN BEARS THE SMALL LOGO, SUPERED IN THE LOWER RIGHT
     CORNER:

     TV 10, NEWS LIVE.

     WE SEE, FROM ABOVE, STARLING, HOSING DOWN THE BABY, AND
     WALKING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF
     AN AMBULANCE, AND THE HELO SHOT SHIFTS TO AN AMBULANCE
     SCREAMING AROUND THE CORNER. 

     ANGLE 

     BACK ON THE STREET.  STARLING, HOLDING THE BABY, IS WALKING
     THROUGH THE SCENE OF THE CARNAGE.  SHE SEES BRIGHAM, RAISING 
     HIMSELF TO AN ELBOW, AND HE MOUTHS, "I'M ALRIGHT..."

     STARLING WALKS ON, PAST THE CAR, WITH THE DEAD BODIES. 
     PARAMEDICS COME OUT OF THE STOPPED AMBULANCE, AND ONE OF THEM
     TAKES THE INFANT FROM THE DAZED STARLING.

     STARLING HELPS BRIGHAM TO HIS FEET.  HE STANDS WOOZILY, HE
     BEGINS TO UNBUCKLE THE KEVLAR PROTECTIVE VEST HE WEARS. 

                          BRIGHAM

                          BRIGHAM 
                Are you alright...? 

     THEY ARE SCREAMING OVER THE SOUND OF THE HELICOPTER. 

                          STARLING 
                I almost shot the baby...

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.  BRIGHAM

                Sergeant...

     AN OFFICER, FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER, COMES UP TO BRIGHAM.  THE
     THREE ADVANCE TOWARD THE SCENE AT THE PARKED CAR. 

     STARLING TURNS TOWARD THEM.

     WE SEE THE SECOND OFFICER PICK UP THE SHOTGUN FROM THE ARMS
     OF THE "RAINCOAT" MAN.

                They're dead... standdown, it's alr... 

     ANGLE 

     ON THE OFFICER PICKING UP THE SHOTGUN.  IT DISCHARGES.

     ANGLE ON BRIGHAM, AS HE FALLS, FELLED BY THE SHOTGUN BLAST. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE TURNS, TO LOOK AT THE SCENE, OF THE DYING 
     BRIGHAM. 

     SHE STARTS TO TAKE A STEP TOWARD HIM, AND STOPS.

     SHE LOOKS UP AT THE HELICOPTER.

     ANGLE

     THE TV IMAGE, WITH THE LOGO ON IT, WE SEE IT ZOOM IN ON 
     STARLING LOOKING UP, SHE THEN WALKS, DAZEDLY, TOWARD THE
     OBVIOUSLY DEAD BRIGMAN, AND SITS, SEVERAL FEET FROM HIM.  WE
     SEE SEVERAL OFFICERS COMING FORWARD TOWARD HER.

     KITCHEN. 

     INT THE KITCHEN, FELL TAKES A KNIFE FROM A MAPLE BLOCK, TRIES
     ITS EDGE, REPLACES IT, TAKES OUT A CLEAVER, AND NODS.  HE
     LOOKS ABOVE, AND TAKES DOWN A COPPER SAUCEPAN FROM THE POT
     RACK.  HE OPENS THE REFRIGERATOR, GLANCES BRIEFLY INSIDE,
     AND NODS, IN SATISFACTION, AND CLOSES IT. 

     HE PICKS UP A DISHTOWEL, TRIES IT BETWEEN HIS HANDS, TESTING
     ITS STRENGTH. 

     HE PUTS IT DOWN, DISSATISFIED. 

     HE BEGINS TO PROWL THROUGH THE APARTMENT, HE PASSES ANOTHER

     ANGLE INS. 

     FELL'S HAND DRAWS OUT THE SCARF.  NESTLED IN THE SCARF IS 
     THE PHOTO OF PAZZI IN FRONT OF THE WANTED POSTER. 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE LOOKS AT THE PICTURE.  HE THEN BEGINS TO
     PEER VERY CLOSELY AT IT.  HE PICKS UP THE MAGNIFYING GLASS
     FROM THE DESK, AND WE SEE, IN A HUGE INSERT, THAT HE IS
     MOVING THE MAGNIFYING GLASS TO ATTEMPT TO MAKE OUT THE 
     FIGURE REFLECTED IN THE GLASS COVERING THE WANTED POSTER, ID,

                Yes, but the important thing, as I've 
                said... 

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...get me a cigarette. 

     PAZZI GETS UP FROM THE BED, AND WRAPS HIMSELF IN A SHEET,
     AND PROCEEDS INTO THE STUDY. 

                          PAZZI 
                The essential thing.  The essential 
                thing, is that we must be absolutely
                quiet about... 

     HE PULLS OPEN THE DESK DRAWER, AND TAKES OUT A PACK OF
     CIGARETTES. 

     HE LOOKS WONDERINGLY, AT THE DRAWER, BEAT.  HE SHRUGS, HE
     IS ABOUT TO START BACK INTO THE BEDROOM, HE GLANCES AT THE
     CURTAINS, BLOWING IN THE OPEN WINDOW, HESITATES.

                          MRS. PAZZI 
                ...what is it? 

     HE LOOKS INTO THE DESK, SHAKES HIS HEAD.  BEAT.

     AND THEN RETURNS INTO THE BEDROOM. 

                          MRS. PAZZI (cont'd) 
                ...you've forgotten the cigarettes. 

     PAZZI TURNS, AND LOOKS BACK TOWARD THE OPEN WINDOW, AND THE
     BLOWING SHADES.

     EXT FLORENTINE PARK NIGHT.

     A YOUNG WOMAN WALKS PAST THE CAMERA.  SHE TAKES US TO FELL,
     WHO IS SITTING ACROSS FROM THE STATUE OF THE LION AND THE
     BIRD, HE IS PICKING HIS TEETH, AND, VERY DELICATELY, TAKES 
     OUT A SCARF, AND WIPES HIS MOUTH.  WE SEE IT IS THE SCARF
     WHICH HE STOLE FROM PAZZI, HE TAKES OUT THE PHOTOGRAPH OF 
     THE WANTED POSTER, AND LOOKS AT IT, AS HE WALKS THROUGH THE
     PARK. 

     CAMERA TAKES HIM OUT OF THE PARK, PAST THE YOUNG WOMAN, WHO,
     WE SEE, HAS RETURNED TO A STROLLER, WHICH IS EMPTY, SHE IS
     TALKING TO A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, AND GESTURING, "ABOUT THIS
     HIGH..."  SHOWING THE HEIGHT OF HER CHILD.  HE AND THE
     WOMAN START LOOKING IN THE BUSHES.

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, LEAVING THE PARK, HE WALKS PAST AN APPLIANCE STORE, 
     IN THE WINDOW OF WHICH WE SEE, TEN SILENT TV SCREENS, AND A
     TALKING HEAD ANNOUNCER.

     THE SCENE SHIFTS TO THE HELICOPTER FOOTAGE OF STARLING.

     WE SEE PHOTOS DISPLAYED OF STARLING, NEXT TO THE PEOPLE SHE
     SHOT IN THE SHOOTOUT, AND A VISBO PROCLAIMS, "KILLER OF
     FIVE, THE DEATH ANGEL: CLARICE STARLING." 

     EXT STARLING'S HOUSE, DAY. 

     STARLING, MAPP, AND JIM, MAPP'S BOYFRIEND, ARE COMING OUT OF
     THE HOUSE WITH CRAWFORD, ESCORTED TOWARD SEVERAL CARS OF
     WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A FUNERAL CORTEGE. 

     A SEDAN PULLS UP, AND KRENDLER GETS OUT.

                          KRENDLER
                I came to pay my... 

                          STARLING 
                ...get outta my way, you sonofabitch... 

                          KRENDLER 
                I realize, you're under a lot of....

                          STARLING 
                You put my friend in the ground, with
                your mickeymouse TaskForce...  Izsat 
                the kind of Headlines that Preserve and
                Promote, you, sir? 

     SHE STARTS PUSHING HIM, AND CAMERA PANS, TO A GROUP OF
     NEWSVANS, CORDONED OFF, AROUND THE CORNER, AND HELD IN BAY 
     BY VARIOUS POLICE.  STARLING IS BEING SUBDUED BY CRAWFORD
     ET AL. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                    (AS SHE PUSHES AT KRENDLER) 
                Izzat the kind of publicity will aid Our
                Run for Congress?  You swine, you...

                          KRENDLER 
                    (SHRIEKING AT HER) 
                You're out she's out... 

     SHE IS BEING DOCILED, AND LED AWAY. 

                          KRENDLER (cont'd)
                    (SHOUTING AFTER HER)

                Trailer Trash BITCH, you still looking 
                for your Daddy, Beat you up, to show he
                Loves you? 

     ANGLE.  ON STARLING, STANDING BY THE LINE OF CARS.  SHE
     SEES SOMETHING, AND TURNS. 

     ANGLE XCU STARLING AS SHE LOOKS.  KRENDLER CONTINUES HIS
     HARANGUE. 

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     ON THE REAR DECK OF A CAR, A STETSON HAT, WITH A BULLET
     THROUGH IT, AND AN OLD SQUARE POLICEBADGE, WITH A BULLETHOLE
     THROUGH IT . 

                          KRENDLER (cont'd)
                    (VO) 
                Looking for your Daddy, fuck you and
                mark you up, an... 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE BLINKS, AND SHAKES HER HEAD TO CLEAR 
     IT. 

     THE SEDAN DRIVES OFF, AS SHE STRAINS TO LOOK AFTER IT.

                          KRENDLER (cont'd) 
                Well, here I am, you... 

     STARLING SHAKES HER HEAD AGAIN, FINDS HERSELF FACING 
     KRENDLER, AND PUNCHES HIM IN THE STOMACH.  KRENDLER GOES 
     DOWN.  STARLING IS SUBDUED BY HER COMFORTERS.  SHE STRAINS 
     TO LOOK AFTER THE DEPARTING CAR.

     INT VERGER'S ROOM. 

     ON THE TV STARLING, BEING PULLED OFF OF KRENDLER.

     ANGLE, OVER VERGER, ONTO CORDELL.

                          VERGER
                Quod videt monumentum, circumspice.
                Need I translate? 

                          CORDELL 
                If you would see him monument, look
                around you. 

                          VERGER
                Show me the Pigs. 

     THE VIDEOSCREEN CHANGES, TO SHOW THE PIGS, ATTACKING THE
     DUMMY MAN.

                          CORDELL 
                Telephone call.  From Switzerland, sir. 

     VERGER CONVERSES IN GERMAN, WITH THE SWISS.  HE IS TOLD
     THAT THEY CAN HAVE A DATE, AND THAT A PACKAGE WILL BE
     COMING HIS WAY SOON. 

     ANGLE.  ON VERGER, LOOKING AT THE PIGS. 

     EXT FLORENTINE PALAZZO. NIGHT.

     PAZZI, WALKING DOWN THE STREET.  NERVOUSLY ADJUSTS HIS SCARF.

     ANGLE 

     A BRIGAND, LOUNGING BY A VAN, NODS IMPERCEPTIBLY, AT PAZZI, 
     WHO CONTINUES WALKING.

     THE BRIGAND GOES INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.

     ANGLE INT THE VAN. 

     THERE IS ANOTHER BRIGAND INSIDE.  THERE ARE SEVERAL FIREARMS 
     IN A RACK, AND A HOSPITAL GURNEY WITH HEAVY RESTRAINTS.  THE
     SECOND BRIGAND IS LOADING AN ODD LOOKING SHOULDER WEAPON. 

                          SECOND BRIGAND 
                I hit him with the beanbag gun, you stand
                by:  he's still flopping... 

     THE FIRST BRIGAND NODS, AND TAKES A CAPPED HYPODERMIC
     SYRINGE FROM THE SECOND MAN.

                          SECOND BRIGAND (cont'd) 
                Just make sure he's alive, because I've
                already spent the bonus... 

     THE FRUIT MAN NODS TO THE SECOND, AND WE SEE PAZZI
     PROCEEDING UP THE STAIRS INTO THE PALAZZO.

     INT A SALON AT THE PALAZZO, NIGHT.

     A WORKER IS MOVING A FLOOR POLISHER ACROSS THE MARBLE FLOOR 
     OF THE SALON, IN AN ANTEROOM BEYOND WE HEAR FELL LECTURING.
     THE WORKER NODS DIFFERENTIALLY, AT SOMEONE OFF SCREEN. 

     WE SEE HE HAS NODDED AT PAZZI, WHO TAKES US TO THE DOOR OF
     THE SALON.

     HE WIPES HIS HANDS NERVOUSLY, HE MOPS HIS BROW, HE LOOKS AT
     HIS WATCH. 

     HE LOOKS INTO THE SALON.

     ANGLE HIS POV 

     FELL, IN FRONT OF A LECTERN.  A SLIDE MACHINE IS SHOWING A 
     PAINTING OF A HANGED FIGURE ON A HUGE DRIPCLOTH AT THE BACK
     OF THE SALON.

     ANGLE, ON PAZZI, AS HE MOVES TO THE SIDE, IE, OUT OF THE
     DOORWAY TO THE SALON, HE GLANCES OVER HIS SHOULDER, TO MAKE
     SURE HE IS OUT OF THE SIGHT OF THE WORKMAN WITH THE FLOOR
     POLISHER.  HE SEES THE WORKMAN TURN THE POLISHER OFF AND 
     BEGIN COILING THE LONG ELECTRIC CORD.  PAZZI TAKES A SMALL
     FLAT AUTOMATIC FROM A HIP HOLSTER.  CHECKS THE CHAMBER, AND
     SLIPS IT INTO HIS JACKET POCKET.  HE PROCEEDS BACK TO THE
     DOORWAY, WHERE WE AND HE SEE FELL, BEYOND, LECTURING TO A
     COMPANY OF SIX MEN, IN THE SALON. 

                          FELL
                    (LECTURING) 
                Della vigna was disgraced and blinded 
                for his betrayal of his emperor's trust-
                -through avarice.  Avarice and hanging
                    (HE GESTURES TO THE PAINTING)
                are linked in the ancient and the
                madeadeval mind. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, AS HANNIBAL (FELL) SPEAKS, HE MOVES TO A
     WINDOW, AND WIPES HIS HAND AGAIN, AND WE SEE HIM LOOK DOWN
     AT THE VAN IN THE STREET, AND WIPE HIS HANDS, MUCH OF THIS
     SPEECH PLAYS AS VOICE-OVER AS HE DOES SO. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Judas and Pier Della Vigna are linked in
                Dante by the avarice he saw in them, and
                their subsequent deaths by hanging.  Ah
                Commendatore Pazzi... 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE SPEAKS TO PAZZI, HALF-SEEN IN THE DOORWAY. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                You are welcome.  Since you are closest
                to the door, would you close the door, to
                improve the quality of the image.
                    (PAZZI DOES SO) 
                You will be interested in this,
                Commandatore, as there are two Pazzi's 
                already in Dante's inferno... 

     ANGLE ON FELL, AS HE WALKS FORWARD, BETWEEN THE CHAIRS OF
     THE SIX OLD MEN (THE STUDIOLO) WHO SIT LISTENING TO HIS
     LECTURE.  A FEW TAKE NOTES. 

                          FELL (cont'd)
                    (TO THE OLD MEN) 
                Camicion de Pazzi, as you know, murdered
                a kinsman, and rests in hell awaiting the
                arrival of a Second Pazzi.  But it's not
                you:  it's Carlino, who will rest 
                forever in hell for the crime of
                Treachery. 

     ANGLE XCU, ON FELL, LOOKING AT PAZZI. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI, UNDER THE WITHERING STARE.  BEAT.

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                    (AS HE CONTINUES BACK TO HIS
                     LECTERN) 
                Avarice, and Hanging, then. 
                    (HE GESTURES TO THE PHOTOGRAPH
                     OF THE PAINTING) 
                On the next occasion, you might like to
                discuss the matter of Chewing.  Chewing
                in Dante:  Count Ugolino, chewing the
                back of the archbishop's head--Satan,
                with his three Faces, chewing Judas,
                Brutus, and Cassius... all three 
                traitors.  Is it not?  Thank you all for
                your kind attention. 

     THE SCHOLARS APPLAUD HIM, TWO STAND, AND TAKE HIM BY THE
     HAND.

     ANGLE ON PAZZI AT THE DOOR.  HE OPENS THE DOOR, AND THE OLD
     MEN OF THE STUDIOLO EXIT, CHATTERING HAPPILY ABOUT THE 
     LECTURE.  FELL COMES OUT, THE LAST OF THE SALON. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Would you say that I've preserved my
                job, Commendatore? 

                          PAZZI 
                I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it
                seemed as if they, as if they... 

                          FELL 
                Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do
                I owe...? 

                          PAZZI
                I require... 

                          FELL 
                ...yes, yes, yes... 

     HE FOLLOWS FELL BACK INTO THE ROOM, WHERE FELL BEGINS
     PUTTING AWAY HIS MATERIAL IN THE D1RTY SALON. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                ...the effects of my predecessor. 

                          PAZZI 
                I'd like to walk home with you, and... 

                          FELL 
                Yes, of course, and we'll collect them.
                I won't be a minute... 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI AS HE WALKS UP TOWARD FELL. 

     HE PUTS HIS HAND IN THE JACKET POCKET.

     ANGLE INS 

     THE HAND, SEEN THROUGH THE CLOTH, GRIPPING THE AUTOMATIC 
     PISTOL.

     ANGLE 

     ON FELL, AS HE BEGINS TO PACK UP THE SLIDE PROJECTOR, AND 
     THEN HESITATES.

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Ah, no.  I should have shown them this
                one.. 
                    (HE TAKES OUT A SLIDE AND PUTS
                     IT IN THE PROJECTOR)
                This one will interest you:  let me see
                if I can improve the focus... 

     WE SEE THE IMAGE OF A HANGED MAN APPEAR ON THE DROPCLOTH.
     THERE IS A PLAQUE DRAPED AROUND THE NECK OF THE HANGED MAN.

                          FELL (CONT'D)
                Can you make it out, can you make out
                the name on the plaque? 

     FELL WALKS UP TO THE IMAGE DISPLAYED ON THE DROPCLOTH, PAZZI
     WALKS BEHIND HIM.

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                    (LOOKING AT THE IMAGE) 
                It says Pazzi.  Pazzi.  And a rude, a 
                very rude poem, this is your ancestor.
                Francesco, hanging outside the Palazzio
                Vecchio.  Outside These Very Windows. 

     HE TURNS AND FIXES PAZZI WITH HIS GAZE.

     ANGLE, FELL, HIS FACE SEEN IN THE DARK, IN THE BEAM OF THE
     SLIDE PROJECTOR.

     HOLD. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                On a related subject Signor Pazzi, I must
                confess to you:  I'm giving serious
                thought to eating your wife. 

     FELL JERKS THE DROP CLOTH DOWN OVER THE TWO OF THEM.

     ANGLE XCU, ON PAZZI'S FACE AS HE SEES THE CLOTH COMING DOWN.

     ANGLE INS 

     HIS HAND, GOING INTO HIS POCKET, AS HE TRIES TO BRING OUT 
     THE PISTOL.

     ANGLE

     ON THE FACE OF FELL, AS HE ADVANCES, UNDER THE CLOTH,
     ON PAZZI, FELL TAKES A SMALL SPONGE AND A BOTTLE FROM HIS 
     POCKET, AND DUMPS LIQUID FROM THE BOTTLE ONTO THE SPONGE,
     AND GRABS PAZZI BY THE HAIR, PUTS HIM INTO A CHOKEHOLD, AND
     HOLDS THE SPONGE TO PAZZI'S FACE. 

     ANGLE EXT, THE DROP CLOTH, AS WE SEE THE EFFECTS OF THE
     STRUGGLE, AND HEAR THE SMALL PISTOL GOING OFF. 

     ANGLE EXT THE PALAZZO. 

     THE LAST MEMBER OF THE STUDIOLO, COMING OUT, A WORKMAN
     FOLLOWS HIM, AND BEGINS LOCKING THE DOOR. 

     ANGLE 

     ON THE BRIGANDS, AT THEIR VAN, THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER,
     ONE CHECKS HIS WATCH. 

     ANGLE INT THE SALON.

     THE FLOOR POLISHER.  MOVING, AS IF OF ITS OWN VOLITION,
     ACROSS THE FLOOR. 

     ANGLE 

     ON PAZZI, TIED TO THE PODIUM, HIS MOUTH GAGGED.

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER, AS HE COILS UP THE LONG ORANGE CORD OF THE
     FLOOR POLISHER, DRAWING IT TOWARD HIM. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Yes.  Your Wife.  Laura.  L'Orange, which
                is the topnote of her skin, wouldn't you
                say?  Or do I grow too personal?  but 
                that is what I think of, when I think of
                her.  And how could I but think of her? 
                I haven't had a bit all day.  The kidney
                and the liver would be su1table for a 
                dinner tonight.  But the rest of the meat
                should hang for a week, in these cool 
                conditions.  Wouldn't you say?  Nod once
                for yes. 
                    (PAUSE) 
                If you tell me what I need to know, 
                then it would be convenient for me to 
                leave without my meal.  And Mrs. Pazzi
                will remain unscathed.  I'll out the 
                questions to you, and we'll see:  I 
                saw at the theatre you had betrayed me.
                And, when the police didn't come, it was
                clear you had sold me out.  Was it to
                Mason Verger?  Blink one for yes. 

     ANGLE ON PAZZI.  BEAT.  THEN HE BLINKS ONCE. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                Thank you.  And now:  Are his hit men
                waiting outside? 
                    (PAZZI BLINKS ONCE) 
                Was that a single blink?  Yes.  Thank
                you. 

     FELL FINISHES HIS COILING OF THE ROPE, AND WE SEE HE HAS
     FASHIONED A HANGMAN'S NOOSE. 

     FELL TAKES OUT A STILETTO, AND IT OPENS.  HE ADVANCES TOWARD
     PAZZI, WHO TRIES TO RECOIL. 

                          FELL (cont'd) 
                No, no.  I'm going to take the tape off.
                Please do not scream.  Do you think you
                can keep from screaming? 
                    (HE TAKES THE TAPE OFF) 
                ...would it help if I were to cut your
                BOWELS OUT...? 

     WE SEE HIM MAKE A SWIPE AND HEAR PAZZI START TO SCREAM.

     FROM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF THE SALON, WE SEE PAZZI, TAPED TO
     THE PODIUM, BEING IMPELLED, SCREAMING, TOWARD THE WINDOW.

     ORANGE NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK, AS THE PODIUM TILTS THROUGH
     THE OPEN WINDOW.

     THE TWO BRIGANDS AT THE VAN.  REACTION TO THE SOUND OF THE
     SCREAMING, RUN AROUND THE CORNER.  THEY LOOK UP TO SEE PAZZI,
     STILL TAPES TO THE PODIUM, HANGING BY THE ORANGE CORD.

     ANGLE, ON THE VILLAINS, STANDING UNDERNEATH, AS GOUTS OF
     BLOOD FALL ON THEM.

     HE RUNS TO THE FRONT OF THE PALAZZO, HOLDING HIS SHOULDER
     ARM DOWN ALONGSIDE HIS SIDE. 

     HE RUNS PAST THE LOCKED FRONT DOOR, AND TOWARD AN ALLEYWAY. 

     WE HEAR THE SIRENS OF POLICE CARS.  BRIGAND ONE SLOWS HIS
     WALK, AND PROCEEDS INTO THE ALLEYWAY.  HE SEES A SMALL DOOR,
     IN THE SIDE OF THE PALAZZO, AND A LIGHT BEYOND.

     ANGLE INT THE DOOR.

     A SMALL STAIRCASE.  THE BRIGAND ENTERS, HE LOOKS UP. 

     WE HEAR THE SOUND OF RAPIDLY DESCENDING FOOTSTEPS.  THE
     BRIGAND MOUNTS THE STEPS, HOLDING HIS RIFLE BEFORE HIM.  THE
     SOUND OF THE FOOTSTEPS CONTINUES.

     ON THE SECOND FLOOR, THE BRIGAND SHELTERS HIMSELF IN A ROOM,
     OFF THE LANDING.  THE SOUND OF THE DESCENDING FOOTSTEPS
     CONTINUES.

     ANGLE ON THE BRIGAND, HIDING BEHIND THE DOOR.  THEN HE TURNS
     HIS HEAD.

     ANGLE, HIS POV.

     WE ARE IN A LAUNDRY ROOM.

     AROUND.

     ANGLE THE BRIGAND, AS HE LOOKS, THEN TO THE SIDE.

     MAN PROTRUDE FROM A CLOTHES HAMPER, HE WEARS ONLY ONE SHOE.

                Would that add to your mirth? 

                          VERGER 
                Explain in depth the plan we have for
                him.  Until tomorrow.

     AS CORDELL SPEAKS, HE REMOVES A KNIFE, AND BEGINS CUTTING 
     AWAY THE LEGS OF LECHTER'S PANTS, REMOVING HIS SOCKS AND
     SHOES ET CETERA.

     ON LECHTER AND CORDELL.

                          LECHTER 
                One would have thought he'd keep me
                under observation.  To savor his
                triumph. 

                          CORDELL 
                No, I think he proffers to spend his
                happy hours with his playmates. 

                          LECHTER 
                ...young boys, still...? 

                          CORDELL

                          CORDELL 
                ...and then, he'll be coming down. 

                          LECHTER 
                You said the bad news... 

                          CORDELL
                Yes, I did. 

                          LECHTER 
                I believe that your tone implied that 
                there was some good news.... and, do you
                know... there might be good news for
                you... 

                          CORDELL 
                Oh, yes, what?  You'd bribe me, to, to,
                to, "release" you...? 

                          LECHTER 
                I can make you rich. 

                          CORDELL 
                And I expect you to.
                    (HE LEANS CLOSER TO HANNIBAL)

     A SOUND OF SCREAMING, THE TWO POTATOCHIP MEN RUN IN GUNS
     DRAWN, TO SEE CORDELL.  HOLDING HIS HAND TO HIS BLOODY
     FACE.

                    (TO LECHTER) 
                Our other option is to beat you for a
                while, with this axe handle, here.  I
                suppose this is what it feels like. 

     ANGLE 

     ONE OF THE ABDUCTORS (THE POTATOCHIP MEN) GOES TO A CONSOLE
     AND TURNS ON THE SOUND OF RECORDED SCREAMING.  HE LOOKS DOWN
     AT THE PIGS WHO, HEARING THE SCREAMING, COME TO THE SIDE OF
     THE PEN.  HE LOOKS BACK TOWARD THE DIRECTION OF CORDELL, AND
     LECHTER, AND WINCES. 

     HE RAISES THE AXE HANDLE AND PREPARES TO STRIKE.

     INT VERGER'S ROOM.

     VERGER IS SEEN IN THE FLICKER OF THE TV SCREEN.

                Yes.  Come here.  For what good is

                if it is not also entertaining.....come--

     WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE AXE HANDLE HITTING SOMETHING.

     WOODS. 

     WE SEE THE MUSTANG, BEHIND HER, COVERED WITH BOUGHS, IN THE
     WOODS, AND BEYOND THAT, BELOW HER, THE GUARDHOUSE. 

     CAMERA TAKES HER UP TO A BARBEDWIRE FENCE, CAMOUFLAGED, WITH
     BRUSH WOVEN INTO IT.  A LARGE TREE STANDS NEXT TO THE FENCE,
     WITH A BOUGH RUNNING FROM THE NEAR SIDE TO THE FAR SIDE. 

     ANGLE, STARLING LOOKS AT IT, AND SMILES.  SHE WALKS FORWARD,
     LOOKING INTENTLY AT THE GROUND. 

     ANGLE, HER POV.  A SMALL TRIPWIRE, SUSPENDED SIX INCHES OFF
     THE GROUND, COVERS THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE SO-ATTRACTIVE
     TREE.  STARLING FOLLOWS THE TRIPWIRE DOWN, PARALLEL TO THE
     FENCE.  SHE STEPS OVER THE TRIPWIRE AND PROCEEDS DOWN,
     WATCHING THE FENCE, LOOKING INTENTLY. 

     SHE GOES INTO A GULLY WHERE WE SEE THAT A RUNOFF OF A STREAM
     IS ERODING A HOLE UNDERNEATH THE BARBEDWIRE FENCE.

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE GETS DOWN ON THE GROUND, TAKES A
     STICK AND PROBES IN THE FLOW OF WATER UNDERNEATH THE 
     FENCE.  SHE NODS, SATISFIED, AND BEGINS TO USE THE STICK TO
     ENLARGE THE OPENING UNDER THE FENCE.

     INT VERGER' S ROOM.  NIGHT.

                Oh, yes, one waits so long, and then, and
                then ...ALMOST BY MAGIC...Yes, proceed.
                Please.... proceed... 

     CORDELL STARTS TO EXIT.

                          VERGER 
                OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it. 

     CORDELL MOVES TO THE FORKLIFT, STARTS IT, AND IT MOVES
     TOWARD THE GURNEY.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE WATCHES THE FORKLIFT GENTLY PICK UP
     VERGER IN THE GURNEYBED.  THE SOUND OF SCREAMING STOPS.

                On the ground, on the ground... 

     SHE MOVES TO HIM, AS HE COMPLIES, AND REMOVES HANDCUFFS, AND
     CUFFS THE MAN AROUND A POLE.  HE STARTS TO REMONSTRATE, AND
     SHE HITS HIM ON THE HEAD WITH HER GUNBUTT.  SHE EXITS THE
     TACKROOM, AND ENTERS THE BARN AND ADVANCES ON THE MAULED
     AND BEATEN FORM OF LECHTER.

                          LECHTER 
                Good morning, Clarice. 

                          STARLING 
                Can you walk?  Are your legs working...? 

                          LECHTER
                Perhaps... shall we see...? 

                          STARLING 
                I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due

                understand...?  Do right and you'll live

     STARLING TAKES OUT A KNIFE, AND BEGINS TO CUT THE DOCTOR LOOSE. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                I'll do the rest, if you give me the
                knife. 

     SHE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER, AT THE FORKLIFT COMING DOWN THE
     HILL. 

                          STARLING 
                No, I don't think so. 

     LECHTER HAS FREED HIMSELF, AND IS CHAFING HIS LIMBS TO
     RESTORE CIRCULATION. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                    (AS SHE POINTS TO THE FORKLIFT) 
                I'm going to subdue our friends, coming
                down the hill, and I want you to cuff

     PISTOL, BUT IT IS JUST OUT OF REACH. 

     HE LOOKS UP.

     ANGLE

     ON VERGER AND CORDELL, APPROACHING LECHTER.

                          CORDELL 
                Stop there, would you, please, Doctor...?

                          LECHTER
                The girl could use some help.

                Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest 
                Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the
                only crime.  I never ceased to hope! 

                          LECHTER 
                The girl needs help.

                to release her, from the bonds of this
                sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU
                THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE

                you'd just stop doing that, I'm going to
                give you something nice. 

                          FRANKLIN 
                He don't like popcorn. 

                          CORDELL
                No.  And... 

                          FRANKLIN
                I like Popcorn... 

                          CORDELL 
                ...yes, if you'll, just step away... 

                          FRANKLIN 
                You give me whatever I want...? 

                          CORDELL 
                Yes.  You know I will.  That's right. 

                          FRANKLIN
                Awright. 

     FRANKLIN STEPS AWAY.  AND CORDELL RUNS UP TO VERGER AND
     TRIES TO REVIVE HIM.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, AS HE MOVES AROUND THE PEN, AND PULLS A LEVER
     WHICH OPENS THE GATE.

     ANGLE 

     ON THE PIGS, AS THEY START TO MOVE INTO THE AREA OCCUPIED BY
     CORDELL AND VERGER.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN.

                          FRANKLIN (cont'd) 
                You know what I want...? 

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, BENT OVER VERGER, AS HE LOOKS BACK. 

     ANGLE ON FRANKLIN. 

                          FRANKLIN (cont'd)
                I WANT KITTYKAT!!!

     ANGLE 

     ON CORDELL, AS HE SEES THE PIGS APPROACHING, HE STARTS TO
     SCREAM.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, AS HE CLIMBS UP TO THE AREA WHERE WE SEE
     LECHTER. 

                          LECHTER 
                Let me down, son, let me down. 

                          FRANKLIN 
                What'll you do for me? 

                          LECHTER 
                I'll take you home. 

                          FRANKLIN
                Ain't got no home. 

                          LECHTER 
                Then what would you like...? 

     FRANKLIN COMES OVER AND WHISPERS TO HIM.

     ANGLE 

     ON HANNIBAL, AS HE RECOILS.  BEAT.  THE SOUND OF
     SCREAMING STOPS.

     PAUSE 

                          HANNIBAL
                    (PAUSE) 
                Yes.  You shall have it... 

                          FRANKLIN 
                Then you goin to hell... 

                          HANNIBAL
                ...that's right... 

     FRANKLIN LOOSES THE ROPE WHICH HOLDS LECHTER, AND LECHTER
     ENTERS THE PIGPEN.  WE SEE THE PIGS, AT THE FAR END, 
     SAVAGING WHAT WE ASSUME TO BE THE FORMS OF VERGER AND
     CORDELL. 

     ANGLE 

     ON HANNIBAL, AS HE STOOPS TO THE FORM OF STARLING, AND 
     GATHERS HER UP.  THE PIGS ADVANCE ON HIM, AND THEN STOP...
     HE STEPS THROUGH THEM, AND OUT OF THE BARN. 

     ANGLE EXT THE BARN. 

     STARLING, PUT DOWN IN THE GRASS.  BEAT.  SHE STIRS.  SHE HALF-
     OPENS HER EYES.

     ANGLE, HER POV LECHTER, WALKING TOWARD HER, BEHIND HIM THE
     VERGER ESTATE BURSTING INTO ROARING FLAMES.

     ANGLE 

     ON FRANKLIN, STANDING BY THE FLAMES, LOOKING AT LECHTER, AS
     HE WALKS UP TOWARD STARLING. 

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER, AS HE PICKS UP STARLING, WE SEE A SECURITY CAR
     COMING DOWN THE DRIVE, AS LECHTER AND STARLING FADE INTO
     THE WOODS. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

     INT SUMPTUOUS, ELEGANT DININGROOM.

     STARLING, IN A DECOLLETE EVENING GOWN, STANDING IN FRONT OF 
     A PERFECT PRESENTATION OF BACCARAT AND LIMOGES.

     ANGLE HER POV.

     LECHTER, IN A TUXEDO, STANDING AGAINST THE BALCONY OF THE 
     ROOM, WHICH LOOKS OUT ON THE SEA.  HE SMILES AT HER.

                          LECHTER
                You look lovely. 

                          STARLING
                Thank you. 
                    (SHE MOVES TO SIT, AND 
                     LECHTER COMES UP AND HOLDS
                     HER CHAIR FOR HER) 
                No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you
                find me so..."

                          LECHTER 
                I'd prefer you to say what you feel. 

                          STARLING
                What is that that smells so wonderful. 

                          LECHTER 
                I hope you'll find it so. 
                    (HE POURS HER A GLASS OF
                     WINE) 
                Yes.  It's good to see you regaining 
                your strength... 

                          STARLING
                Thanks to you... 

     WE SEE LECHTER EXCUSE HIMSELF, AND RETIRE INTO THE KITCHEN.
     WE SEE HIM TAKING DOWN SAUCEPANS, AND MIXING WHAT APPEARS TO
     BE A MARINADE.

                          LECHTER
                Now, what were we last speaking of...? 

                          STARLING 
                We were speaking of my father... 

     LECHTER POURS THE MARINADE INTO A PAN, LIGHTS THE FLAME IN
     THE STOVE, WIPES HIS HANDS, AND RETURNS TO THE DININGROOM. 

                          LECHTER
                ...I'm sorry....? 

                          STARLING 
                ...we were speaking of my father... 

                          LECHTER
                Indeed we were. 

                          STARLING 
                ...and my need for The Institution... 

                          LECHTER 
                Freud, do you know...?  Freud 
                psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon. 

                          STARLING 
                And how did he do that? 

                          LECHTER 
                He saw the truth, and spoke it... 

                          STARLING 
                I'm afraid, this wine is making me
                woozy... 

                          LECHTER 
                ...you have to eat... 

     LECHTER RETURNS TO THE KITCHEN, INDICATING "ONE MOMENT." 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                    (AS THE CAMERA TAKES HIM TO 
                     THE KITCHEN, AND WE HALF-SEE
                     THE TORSO OF A MAN SITTING
                     IN A KITCHEN CHAIR) 
                You've sought out The Institution all 
                your life, as you with it to replace your
                Father.  This is obvious.  Less obvious
                is this:  that you require the 
                institution not to support you, but to 
                FAIL.  FOR THIS KEEPS YOUR FATHER ALIVE. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, SITTING, NODDING, AS SHE DRINKS HER WINE.  SHE
     PUTS THE GLASS DOWN, A TRIFLE WOOZY. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                ...as this keeps your father alive.  The
                truth is two-fold, and the truth is one: 

     THE WIND FROM THE OCEAN BLOWS A STRAND OF HAIR ACROSS HER
     EYES, SHE BRUSHES IT BACK. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd)
                    (VO) 
                That every man is fallible, that every
                institution, being made of men, cannot
                but be corrupt... 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, LOOKING DOWN AT HER HAND. 

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     THE HAND IS COVERED WITH MUD AND BLOOD.

     ANGLE, STARLING, LOOKING PERPLEXED, AT THE KITCHEN WHERE WE 
     SEE THE FORM OF LECHTER, MOVING ACROSS THE KITCHEN.

     ANGLE 

     ON LECHTER.

     AS WE SEE, HE CARRIES A SCALPEL, HE MOVES TOWARD THE HALF-
     SEEN FORM OF THE MAN IN THE CHAIR.

     HE BENDS DOWN OVER THE MAN, AND WE SEE THAT HE CARRIES A
     SCALPEL AND A SMALL MEDICAL SAW... 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                ...the only art in this dish, of course,
                is that it must be fresh... 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, IN THE ROOM, AS SHE PICKS UP A SMALL ROSEBUD
     FROM THE CUT CRYSTAL BUDVASE IN FRONT OF HER.

     SHE LOOKS AT IT WOOZILY, AND IT FALLS FROM HER FINGERS.
     SHE BENDS DOWN.

     ANGLE, HER POV, THE FLOOR.

     THE ROSEBUD, ON A FILTHY, TORN LINOLEUM FLOOR, HER LEGS
     ENCASED IN THE MUDDY PANTS WE SAW HER IN AT VERGER'S FARM. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE STRAIGHTENS, HOLDING THE ROSE.  WE SEE A
     LOOK OF CONSTERNATION ON HER FACE.  HER FACE IS BLOODY, AND
     COVERED IN MUD, WE SEE SHE IS NOT IN A SUMPTUOUS
     DININGROOM, BUT IN A SLUM. 

     ANGLE HER POV 

     LECHTER, IN THE KITCHEN, IN TUXEDO, MOVING PAST THE DOORWAY.

     ANGLE INT THE KITCHEN.

     LECHTER, AS WE NOW SEE, IN THE FILTHY KITCHEN OF A SLUM. 
     COOKING ON A HOTPLATE.  DRESSED IN WORKCLOTHES, CAMERA TAKES
     HIM, FROM BEHIND, TO THE SLUMPED FORM OF THE MAN, CAMERA CUTS
     OFF AT THE MAN'S SHOULDERS, WE SEE LECHTER, FROM THE BACK,
     LIFTING SOMETHING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE MAN'S HEAD, AND
     CARRYING IT BACK TO THE FILTHY TABLETOP, WHERE, AS HE SPEAKS,
     HE BEGINS KNEADING IT WITH FLOUR, WE SEE THE PAN SIZZLING
     ON THE HOTPLATE. 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE SLUM ROOM.  STARLING, DAZED, AND LECHTER, REENTERING. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                That the institution cannot but be 
                corrupt, and, therefore, it cannot be
                but an act of complicity to seek to
                appease it. 

     HE MOVES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN, PUTS THE BREADED PIECES OF
     CUTLET INTO THE PAN, THE FIRE SHOOTS UP. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                So many civilizations eat their slain
                enemies... what do you think...?  How
                much better to devour a person 
                physically, than to devour his spirit. 
                Which is, of course, the purpose of the
                institution. 

     HE REMOVES THE MEAT FROM THE PAN, AND FORKS IT ONTO A TIN
     PLATE.

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                    (REENTERING THE DININGROOM) 
                :and that is the especial surprise,
                I've prepared for You! 

                          STARLING
                I feel weak... 

                          LECHTER
                    (NODDING) 
                ...you must eat. 

     SHE LOOKS DOWN AT THE TABLE.  SHE PICKS UP HER FORK.

     ANGLE HER POV 

     THE LOVELY LINEN TABLE, THE STEAMING MEAT ON THE LIMOGES
     PLATE. 

     A HUGE COCKROACH, SCURRYING ACROSS THE TABLECLOTH.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE RISES, UNSTEADILY, IN HER MUDDY
     CLOTHES...

                          STARLING 
                ...1 don't understand... 

     SHE WALKS TOWARD THE BALCONY WINDOW, LOOKING OUT AT THE
     OCEAN.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     OUT THE WINDOW, A SQUALID CITY STREET, SEEN FROM THE THIRD
     FLOOR. 

     A COUPLE OF CARS STOPPING AT THE END OF THE STREET.

     ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE TURNS BACK TOWARD LECHTER.

                          LECHTER
                    (IN THE KITCHEN) 
                The gift, of course is not the meal--
                but the identification--which of us does
                not need help?  The identity, of your
                true enemy...? 
                ...for you always sought to befriend, to
                wish the love of those who wished you ill. 

     ANGLE, ON LECHTER, STANDING BEFORE THE FIGURE TIED TO THE
     CHAIR. 

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                Come here--he is in no pain, there are
                no nerves in the brain, come here... 

     ANGLE, LECHTER'S POV THE FIGURE OF CRAWFORD TIED TO THE
     CHAIR. 

     LECHTER MOVES TO HIM AND EXTRACTS FROM HIS UPPER POCKET, A
     XEROX OF THE PHOTO OF THE BADGE WITH THE HOLE IN IT. 

                          LECHTER (CONT'D) 
                Come here, I'm going to cure you. 

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     STARLING, IN THE SLUMROOM, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW, LECHTER COMES 
     UP BEHIND HER, AND LOOKS OUT.

     ANGLE HIS POV. 

     THE SLUM STREET, A VAN NOW PULLING UP, A SQUAD OF SWAT 
     OFFICERS APPROACHING A PARKED CAR.

     ANGLE

     ON LECHTER AND CLARICE.

     LECHTER APPROACHES HER.

     ANGLE HIS POV, 

     STARLING, IN THE BEAUTIFUL GOWN, HE MOVES AS IF TO CARESS 
     HER BREAST.

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS DOWN.  WE SEE SHE IS NOW
     CLOTHED IN HER FILTHY CLOTHES, AND LECHTER IS FRISKING
     HER. 

     ANGLE 

     LECHTER, FRISKING THE FILTHY STARLING, TAKES OUT THE
     MARINECORP HATBADGE, WHICH WE SAW EARLIER, HE BREAKS IT
     OPEN, AND REVEALS A MICROTRANSMITTER.

                          LECHTER (cont'd) 
                Oh, no.  Oh, NO.  They've put a beeper on
                you.  How careless of me.  How finally 
                careless, Do you think?  Have I erred on
                Purpose?  Eh?  Or am I just unlucky? 
                Could one not say that's the essential
                question of Philosophy...? 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING ON.

                          STARLING 
                Might I have some more of the wine...? 

     ANGLE ON LECHTER, AS HE MOVES TO A BACK WINDOW.

     STARLING, AS SHE RISES, AGAIN, IN HER BALLGOWN. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                Because, I find I like the effects.  You
                may say that it's inebriation, but it
                seems 
                    (SHE SMILES) 
                This lovely evening, in particular.... it 
                seems to reward me with clarity...
                    (SHE LAUGHS) 

     THERE IS A SOUND BEHIND HER.  THE BEAUTIFUL FRENCHDOORS 
     OPEN AND ADMIT A HAPPY COTERIE OF GOWNED WOMEN AND FORMAL
     DRESSED MEN, THEY ARE ALL CHATTERING THEIR JOY AT SEEING 
     HER. 

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                ....or perhaps, it is just the heat... I
                was just saying to the Doctor...

     ANGLE HER POV THE OPEN WINDOW, THE SHADES BLOWING.

     CAMERA COMES BACK TO STARLING, WHO IS IN HER RAGS, WITH THE

                          STARLING (cont'd) 
                But, do you know, do you know, I'm not
                feeling altogether.... 

     SHE SWOONS.  A SWAT MAN CATCHES HER.

                          SWAT MAN
                ...I've got her... 

     ANGLE 

     IN THE SLUMROOM, WE SEE THAT A SWAT TEAM HAS ENTERED.  ONE OF
     THEM HAS CAUGHT THE FAINTING STARLING IN HIS ARMS.  THE
     SEVERAL MEN PROCEED TOWARD THE BACK OF THE KITCHEN. 

                          STARLING

                          KRENDLER 
                Let's get her out of here....

     SWAT OFFICER, FROM THE KITCHEN.  AS HE GAZES IN THE
     DIRECTION OF CRAWFORD.

                          STARLING 
                But as my father used to say...

                    (IN KITCHEN)
                ...ohmiGod.

     EXT TEXAS GRAVEYARD DAY. 

     A NEW MARBLE HEADSTONE BEING LOWERED ONTO A GRAVE.  IT IS

     AND FATHER.  DIED 1975.

     ANGLE 

     STARLING STANDING BY THE GRAVE, HOLDING FLOWERS, BEHIND HER
     STAND MAPP AND HER BOYFRIEND.  BEHIND THEM STAND AN OFFICIAL
     LOOKING MAN, WHO HOLDS HIS STETSON, REVERENTLY, IN FRONT OF

     DUSTY CEMETERY ROAD. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE KNEELS, AS THE STONE IS PLACED,
     PUTTING A SMALL BOUQUET OF FLOWERS NEXT TO IT.  AS SHE 
     KNEELS, AND CAMERA CRANES DOWN, WE READ THE BOTTOM OF THE

     MISSED."

     ON STARLING, AS SHE STANDS, AND MAPP COMES, AND PUTS HER ARM
     AROUND HER.

                          MAPP 
                That's why it's a stone, you know, It
                means Don't Come Back. 

     STARLING NODS, AND THEY TURN AWAY, AND WALK AWAY FROM THE
     GRAVE.  IN THE BG WE SEE ANOTHER GROUP OF MOURNERS, WEARING
     WESTERN GARB.  STARLING AND HER GROUP CROSS A SERVICE ROAD,
     IN FRONT OF THE OLD TRUCK.

                          STARLING 
                Well.  No.  He can't come back. 

                          MAPP 
                Baby, that's the beginning of wisdom. 

     MAPP PUTS HER ARM AROUND STARLING, AS THEY WALK OFF.
     STARLING NODS, THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS, AND LAYS HER HEAD ON
     MAPP'S SHOULDER.

     WE SEE SEVERAL GRAVEDIGGERS SITTING ON THE BACK.  THE MAN IN
     THE PASSENGER SEAT, WEARING A STRAW WESTERN HAT, TURNS, TO
     LOOK AT STARLING AND THE GROUP.  IT LOOKS LIKE LECHTER. 

     ANGLE ON STARLING, AND HER GROUP, AS THE MAN IN THE TRUCK
     MOMENTARILY CATCHES HER EYE. 

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE GRAVEYARD. 

     A GLINT OF LIGHT PLAYS ACROSS HER FACE, AND SHE SQUINTS.

     ANGLE HER POV. 

     THE LIGHT HITTING THE SHOVEL OF THE GRAVEDIGGER IN THE 
     STRAW HAT.  THE GRAVEDIGGER IS HALF HIDDEN BY THE GROUP HE
     WALKS WITH.

     OVER MAPP, WHO IS TALKING, AND ONTO STARLING, AS SHE STARES
     AT THE GRAVEDIGGER, WHO IS APPROACHING HER. 

     ANGLE 

     ON HER BODY, AS SHE REACHES TO HER BELT FOR A SIDEARM.

     TIGHT ON THE TWO WOMEN, AS STARLING LEANS IN.

                Give me your gun... 

     ANGLE 

     ON MAPP, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING.

                          MAPP 
                ...what...?

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS AT THE APPROACHING FIGURE.

     ANGLE HER POV 

     THE GRAVEDIGGER, AS HE EMERGES FROM THE GROUP.  WE SEE HE IS 
     A NONDESCRIPT LABORER.

     ANGLE 

     ON STARLING AND MAPP.

                ...what, what did you say...?

The universe is deathless;
          Is deathless because, having no finite self,
          it stays infinite.
          A sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead
          of himself,
          By not confining himself to himself,
          sustains himself outside himself.

          INT. DARKENED BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A spherical black monolith rises up from a white surface...
          white like the moon.
                         
          In the darkness, the towers metal skin is barely visible.
                         
          We ROTATE AROUND, revealing the tower to actually be a LAMP --
          not rising up from a surface, but hanging down from a white
          ceiling. The bulb unlit.
                         
          Directly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence -
          a sleeping child. Chest rising and falling with each breath.
                         
          We HOVER over the young boy...watching him. A blanket
          emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs. His
          mouth is slack, eyelids twitching to dreams unseen.
                         
          The truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for.
                         
          We move away from him, exploring the dark room. Strewn with
          toys. The door is slightly ajar. We float through it into--
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --a long hallway. Even darker than the bedroom. And without
          the boys rhythmic breathing, even quieter.
                         
          A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach.
                         
          Someone is standing in front of it.
                         
          The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We
          follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure.
          Standing in a doorway.
                         
          Now we can make out the edges of the person. It is an old
          woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress.
                         
          She stares at us.
                         
                          WOMAN
           Let me in.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          OPENING TITLES play out to the shrill screams of George
          Crumb's `Black Angels I: Night Of The Electric Insects'.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eyes flick open.
                         
          A woman blinks awake, gazing around the room. Another
          bedroom. Sparse. Just a bed and a cabinet. It is 5.43 AM.
                         
          Her eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark. His
          heaving snores have woken her up.
                         
          She is RENAI (pronounced Renee) LAMBERT (36). With a quiet
          determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks,
          but the lines of age are creeping in.
                         
          She has settled into the `comfort' years of a marriage: hair
          pinned up messily, wearing dowdy pajamas.
                         
          She beholds her husband, taking him in. Considering him. He
          snorts and smacks his lips. Very unflattering.
                         
          She climbs out of bed.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          High ceilings. Exposed beams. Spanish style windows.
                         
          Renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living
          room. No matter careful she is, there is a loud creak with
          each step. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK in the corner ticks steadily.
                         
          There is barely any furniture in here, only a BOOKCASE and a
          PIANO. What there is a lot of...is boxes. Large moving boxes.
                         
          Renai plops cross-legged onto the floor and rips open one of
          the boxes, marked BOOKS. She plucks out a handful of books
          and lines them up on the bookshelf. Then another handful.
                         
          They are all self-help and self-improvement books. Titles
          like `Be The Better You' and `Inch By Inch, It's A Cinch: A
          Guide To Achieving Your Goals' pop out.
                         
          She spots a sealed box labelled PHOTO ALBUMS. She strips away
          the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos.
                         
          Smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. The
          happy couple. Young. Glowing. Sadness washes over her.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Mom?
                         
          She snaps out of it and turns to see DALTON LAMBERT (8). Her
          son. He approaches her, rubbing his eyes. (It is not the boy
          we saw in the opening scene.)
           4.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           What are you doing up, kiddo?
                         
                          DALTON
           I don't like my room.
                         
                          RENAI
           You'll get used to it. It's only
           your first night.
                         
          He climbs into her lap. She bites on his ear playfully.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Argh, I'm going to eat you.
                         
                          DALTON
           What are you looking at?
                         
                          RENAI
           Just some photos.
                         
                          DALTON
           What photos?
                         
          She hefts another album from the box, prying it open. A photo
          of a grinning young girl greets them, hair in pigtails.
                         
                          RENAI
           Do you know who that is?
                         
                          DALTON
           No.
                         
                          RENAI
           That's me.
                         
                          DALTON
           It doesn't look like you.
                         
                          RENAI
           I know. I'm so happy there. But
           it's me. When I was your age. I was
           a kid once too, you know.
                         
                          DALTON
           No, you weren't.
                         
          Renai bursts out laughing. She is famous for her big laugh.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thanks. Maybe you're right...I don't
           remember being this person at all.
           I hope she smiled like that all the
           time, whoever she was.
           5.
                         
                         
          She sizes up her son. The living embodiment of the photo.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           This is a terrible thing to admit,
           Dalton, but sometimes I get jealous of
           you. That you're so young. That you
           haven't made any of your decisions yet.
                         
                          DALTON
           I don't wanna grow old.
                         
                          RENAI
           Well, it starts happening to us
           from the moment we're born.
                         
          She points to the hands on the grandfather clock.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Every time that clock ticks, we all
           get a little bit older.
                         
          She turns the page in the photo album, seeing an old man.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           That's your grandpa. You wouldn't
           remember him.
                         
                          DALTON
           He smells like smoke.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yeah...good memory. He did smoke
           that god awful pipe, didn't he?
                         
                          DALTON
           Show me a picture of dad when he
           was a little kid.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't even know if we have any.
           He's hopeless with keeping photos.
                         
                          DALTON
           Show me a picture of me when I was
           a little kid.
                         
                          RENAI
           Your pictures are all in the computer.
           Nobody keeps photo albums like this
           anymore, they're ancient relics. They
           should. I like being able to touch
           something, instead of it floating
           around in cyber world. If the laptop
           breaks, your whole existence is erased.
           6.
                         
                         
                          DALTON
           What was I like when I was a little kid?
                         
                          RENAI
           You are a little kid.
                         
          She kisses him on the forehead and stares into his eyes.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           If only you knew what I know.
                         
          We hear a baby crying off screen.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           You certainly didn't cry as much as
           your little sister does. Come on.

          Chaos.
                         
          Boxes of dinnerware have not been unpacked yet and it is
          turning the usual morning routine into a nightmare.
                         
          Renai is on the phone as her kids buzz around a kitchen island
          at top speed, creating a high-energy, manic pace in the room.

          Her son FOSTER (6), tugs on her leg, holding a box of cereal.
                         
                          FOSTER
           I need a bowl, mom.
                         
          Renai rips open a box, rifling through newspaper, phone
          wedged against her shoulder. She holds out a cup, flustered.

          Foster slumps on the floor, pouring cereal and overflowing milk
          into the cup. A baby girl in a high chair, CALI (2), squeals.

          JOSH LAMBERT (37) gapes into the mirror, face covered in
          soap.
                         
          He washes it off. Now he's awake we see that he is a handsome,
          clean-cut guy - a former high school nerd who got revenge by
          growing into his body.
                         
          He sorts through a box labelled JOSH'S BATHROOM STUFF.
                         
          He takes out two bottles - TONER and MOISTURIZER. He dabs the
          toner on, then smooths the moisturizer into his forehead and
          around his eyes.
                         
          He suddenly notices a grey hair. Looks mortified.
                         
                          JOSH
           (Michael Corleone voice)
           Every time I think I've pulled you
           out...you grow back in.
                         
          He plucks it out, wincing melodramatically.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Ouch!
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, LAMBERT HOME - MORNING
                         
          Josh strides in, tie hanging open around his neck. Renai is
          still on the phone. Josh points to his tie.
                         
                          RENAI
           Well, I'd like to keep the old
           number if I could.
                          (TO JOSH)
           You really need to learn how to do
           this, honey.
                         
          She threads the tie into a knot for him.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (TO FOSTER)
           Don't eat on the floor, buddy.
                         
          Foster stays where he is, slurping cereal from the cup.
          Dalton is playing a handheld videogame. Intensely focused.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Okay, well, please let me know by
           the end of today, I have to give
           the number out. Thank you.
           8.
                         
                         
          She hangs up, pissed.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Foster, get up. Now.
                         
          Foster frowns and obeys.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (TO RENAI)
           How come you were up so early? Was
           Cali crying?
                         
                          RENAI
           You woke me up.
                         
                          JOSH
           What do you mean?
                         
                          RENAI
           You were snoring.
                         
                          JOSH
           No I wasn't.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes you were.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't snore.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes you do.
                         
                          JOSH
           My father snored. I do not snore.
                         
                          RENAI
           How would you know what you do?
           You're asleep.
                         
          Renai marches out of the room. Dalton's game unit beeps
          loudly and he pumps his fist.
                         
                          DALTON
           Yes! I made it to the last level!
           Invisiworld!
                         
          Ever amiable, Josh high five's his son.
                         
                          JOSH
           Good one, champ.
                          (BEAT)
           I don't snore, do I?
           9.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai sees that all the books she unpacked earlier are now
          scattered across the floor of the living room.
                         
                          RENAI
           Where are my bleeping pills?
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, LAMBERT HOME - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai charges in. Josh snatches an apple out of a fruit bowl,
          biting into it. He quickly gags and spits it out into the sink.
                         
                          JOSH
           What the heck is this? Wax?!
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes.
                         
                          JOSH
           Let me get this straight - we have
           no actual fruit but we have wax
           fruit?
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes.
                         
                          JOSH
           That is dangerous. It could kill
           one of our kids.
                         
                          RENAI
           Where are my pills, Josh?
                         
                          JOSH
           Probably where you left them,
           Renai.
                         
          She finds them on the counter, snatching them up.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           See.
                         
                          RENAI
           That's not where I left them.
                         
                          DALTON
           Mom, I need my lunch.
                         
                          RENAI
           Oh, geez. Look, just...take last
           night's dinner.
           10.
                         
                         
          She opens the fridge. It is bare except for a box of sushi.
                         
                          DALTON
           Sushi? Aw, that's weirdo food.
                         
                          RENAI
           It's all we have. Just for today,
           honey.
                         
                          JOSH
           Check it first, Dalton. It's
           probably made out of Styrofoam.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (TO DALTON)
           And while I've got you, if you're
           going to look at my books, please
           don't leave them all over the floor.
                         
                          DALTON
           I didn't touch your books.
                         
          Josh streaks past, kissing Renai on the cheek.
                         
                          JOSH
           I gotta go.
                         
                          RENAI
           Are you taking the boys to school?
                         
                          JOSH
           No time.
                         
                          RENAI
           Well can you pick them up after
           school?
                         
                          JOSH
           Not today.
                         
                          RENAI
           But I have stuff I wanted to...
                         
          She trails off. He's gone. Foster BURPS. Loudly.
                         
                          FOSTER
           Can I have another cup, mom?
                         
                         
          INT. CLASSROOM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Noisy students settle into their desks. Inner city kids,
          mostly Hispanic.
           11.
                         
                         
          Josh is their teacher, scribbling on the blackboard. One
          student, a lanky boy, ALANSO (16), hovers near the door.
                         
                          JOSH
           Alanso, please sit down.
                         
                          ALANSO
           No entiendo.
                         
                          JOSH
           Siéntate, por favor.
                         
          Alanso takes a seat. Josh is having trouble getting control.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Come on guys, quieten down.
                         
          A pretty girl in the front, TERI, is annoyed at the class.
                         
                          TERI
           You better all shut up.
                         
          She commands respect. They do. Except for one kid.
                         
           THE ONE KID
           Just cos you're in love.
                         
                          JOSH
           Thank you, Teri. Today we are going
           to talk about Darwin. It's a city in
           Australia, but it's also the last
           name of which famous naturalist?
                         
                          MALE STUDENT # 1
           Charles Darwin.
                         
                          JOSH
           Correct. Does anybody know what he
           is famous for?
                         
                          MALE STUDENT # 1
           He said that people descended from
           monkeys.
                         
                          JOSH
           Half right. He wrote a seminal book
           that explained his theories on
           natural selection, and how the
           different species on this planet -
           including humans - evolved.
                         
                          ALANSO
           I know I didn't evolve from no
           monkey. Shit.
           12.
                         
                         
          Everyone laughs.
                         
                          JOSH
           Humans actually have a lot in
           common with monkeys, or more
           specifically, chimpanzees.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Maybe you do, but I was created in
           the image of my Dios.
                         
          He takes a gold cross hanging on a necklace out of his shirt,
          kissing it and holding it up. That gets another laugh.
                         
                          JOSH
           I respect your right to believe
           that, Alanso. But I want to give
           you all possible theories. I want
           this class to go out into the world
           with an informed opinion.
                         
                          ALANSO
           The theory is incorrect, Mr. Lambert.
                         
                          JOSH
           How can it be incorrect? It's a
           theory. A scientific theory.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Yeah, well, science is bullshit. We
           didn't get here cos of no test-tubes.
                         
                          JOSH
           Alanso, if you keep talking like
           that I'm going to ask you to visit
           the principal.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Fine.
                         
          He gets up and leaves as the class JEERS and BOOS.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - DAY
                         
          Peace and quiet at last.
                         
          Renai gropes in behind the bookcase, plucking a hidden jewelry
          box free. She pinches a cigarette out of it and lights it.
                         
          She sits down at her piano, feeling the keys, warming her
          fingers up. Sunlight streams in through the windows.
                         
          She takes out a notebook, filled with scribbled handwriting.
           13.
                         
                         
          She places the notebook on the sheetstand, then sets a small,
          mechanical METRONOME in motion and begins tapping out a sombre
          melody in time with it.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (SINGING)
           Yeah, I'm looking west, always been
           looking that way, gonna get it all
           happening, just can't do it today...
                         
          She stops and makes a note in her book. She starts over,
          rising to the emotion of the song. She's got a good voice.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
                          (SINGING)
           Yeah, I'm looking west, always been
           looking that way, I'm gonna be
           somebody, I just can't be her today--
                         
          She is interrupted by the tinny sound of a baby crying.
                         
          She stops playing and looks over at a baby monitor, the
          source of the noise.
                         
          Renai deflates, her shoulders sagging in defeat. She closes
          her notebook and leaves the room.
                         
                         
          INT. CALI'S NURSERY - DAY
                         
          Renai scoops up Cali, rocking her gently.
                         
          A scratching sound interrupts. Rough. Frantic. Like a dog
          pawing at something.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai steps into the hall, curious. She can still hear it.
          She follows the sound to a door. Grabs the door handle.
                         
          The sound abruptly ceases.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The door whines open and stabs a blade of light onto a set of
          stairs that descend into a gloomy basement.
                         
          Renai stands at the top of the stairs, squinting into the
          inky blackness, straining to see.
                         
          She reaches up and yanks a light chain, illuminating a bare
          bulb and throwing light across the tenebrous space.
           14.
                         
                         
          The basement is large and completely bare. Cleaned out.
                         
          Renai takes a step down. She is still carrying Cali.
                         
          FURTHER DOWN below her, we see that there is one step that is
          cracked and broken.
                         
          She takes another step. The broken step is right below her now.
                         
          One more step and she will fall.
                         
          Cali squeals happily. Renai pauses...then turns around,
          heading back up the stairs. Stops when she sees something.
                         
          DEEP, VIOLENT SCRATCH MARKS...running downwards on the inside
          of the door...as if someone were trying to claw their way out.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          A Spanish-style home. Very pretty. This is not the suburbs.
          More of an inner city neighborhood. There's history here.
                         
          Josh pulls into the driveway of his new house in his Subaru.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          The house almost looks liveable.
                         
          Foster is watching loud, zany cartoons on TV. Cali is in a
          high chair. Renai is folding boxes. She has unpacked most of
          the living room and is very tired.
                         
          Josh ambles in, sees the work Renai has done.
                         
                          JOSH
           Look at this. Nice job.
                         
          Foster bolts over and crashes into his dads legs, hugging him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Whoa, buddy. Slow down.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh, where's the box of my lamps?
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't know. They should be here.
           We packed them up.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yeah, I packed them. They're not here.
           15.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           I remember the movers bringing them
           in and putting them right there.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE)
           Well, they're not here. I would
           know, I've been unpacking this
           stuff all day.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton wanders the hall, sporting a red superhero CAPE and
          carrying a plastic, glowing light-sabre toy.
                         
          He reaches a door. The basement door. He pulls it open.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton holds up his light-sabre, the glow allowing him to
          make out the murky corners of the basement below.
                         
          He takes a step down the stairs. Then another step.
                         
          The broken step is right below him.
                         
          He steps again --
                         
          -- and falls. Flails forward, tumbling down the steps, all
          the way to the bottom. His light sabre SHATTERS.
                         
          He hits the ground, his head smacking the floor.
                         
          All is dark.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh sits with Foster, zoned out in front of the droning TV.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Pitch black.
                         
          Dazed, Dalton sits up. His head is cut and bleeding. He is
          alone in the dark. He stares into the corner of the
          surrounding cell.
                         
          His eyes adjust, making out a shape.
                         
          A shadow.
           16.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
                         
          Josh and Renai look up as the quiet is shattered by a SCREAM.
                         
          They spring into action, scrambling to their feet.
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton? Where are you?
                         
          He doesn't answer. Just keeps screaming.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Renai and Josh whip the door open, glaring into the basement
          from the top of the stairs.
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton?
                         
          Dalton is crumpled at the bottom of the steps, sobbing, his
          red cape gathered around him.
                         
          Renai flicks the light on. Her and Josh scamper down the
          steps, propping Dalton up.
                         
                          JOSH
           What happened?
                         
                          DALTON
           I fell.
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton, you have to be careful. You
           shouldn't be coming down here in
           the dark.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where do you hurt the most?
                         
                          DALTON
           My knee and my head. I can't stand
           up.
                         
          Josh lifts him to his feet. A severely grazed knee is dotted
          with blood. He's okay.
                         
                          JOSH
           You scared us, champ.
                         
          Josh carries him up the stairs as he sucks in sobs.
                         
          Renai glances around the basement, her eyes landing on the
          lone object that resides in it.
           17.
                         
                         
          She frowns. It wasn't there when she saw the basement last.
                         
          It is a box. One of her large, cardboard moving boxes.
                         
          It is marked LAMPS.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton is lying in bed, a band-aid slapped across his
          forehead. Renai tucks him in, Josh standing over him.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're lucky you don't need stitches.
                         
                          RENAI
           If I catch you falling down the
           stairs again I'm gonna break your
           neck.
                         
                          DALTON
           That doesn't make sense.
                         
          There are dozens of pictures tacked to the wall, all drawn by
          Dalton. Josh taps one; a drawing of Dalton flying through the
          night sky, wearing his cape.
                         
                          DALTON (CONT'D)
           You might be a superhero but you're
           not invincible. Be more careful, bud.
                         
          Renai kisses him and gets up.
                         
                          RENAI
           Sleep tight, honey.
                         
          They wave goodbye and turn out the light.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai flops into bed beside Josh, exhausted.
                         
                          JOSH
           We've gotta lock that door.
                         
                          RENAI
           He's such a boy. He goes off
           exploring. Sometimes I wanna keep
           him on one of those child leashes.
                         
                          JOSH
           Why bother with a child leash? I'll
           stop at the pet store tomorrow.
           18.
                         
                         
          She laughs and cuddles up to him, resting her head on his chest.
                         
                          RENAI
           I'm sorry I was pissy when you got
           home. I was trying to work on a
           song today and then Cali woke up
           and wouldn't stop crying...
                         
                          JOSH
           I didn't even notice.
                         
                          RENAI
           I feel guilty for wanting my own
           time.
                         
                          JOSH
           It's normal to want your own time.
                         
                          RENAI
           Is it? My mother gave up everything
           for me. I keep waiting for the
           completely selfless parent gene to
           kick in, but I'm exactly the same
           person I was when I was 22, only
           now I'm married with kids.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're a great mother.
                         
                          RENAI
           No, I'm not. They like you so much
           better than me.
                         
                          JOSH
           That's not true.
                         
                          RENAI
           You're the cool dad who comes home
           with presents and I'm the one who
           yells at them all day.
                         
                          JOSH
           Now you're being crazy. They love
           you. At least you get to connect
           with them. I work so much.
                         
                          RENAI
           Believe me, you're their hero. They
           try to play us off against each
           other. They're master manipulators.
           I guess they really are my kids.
                         
          Josh laughs. A lull settles over them.
           19.
                         
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Is this it, Josh?
                         
                          JOSH
           Is this so bad?
                         
          She doesn't answer. They sit in silence for a long beat.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thank you for letting me take some time
           off to work on my music again.
                         
                          JOSH
           We'll get by. I want you to do it.

           There's a couple of songs...I mean
           not all of them, but there's a
           couple of them that I think are
           really good. And I think, maybe I
           could do something with them.
                         
                          JOSH
           I love all your songs.
                         
          They kiss.

          It is 3AM. All the remoteness of that hour is present
          here...we can feel it.
                         
          As still and quiet as deep space.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          A long, dark thoroughfare. A ticking clock its only occupant.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Stairs swallowed up by darkness. The groan of settling wood.

          Dalton is sleeping too. Impossibly still. Lying on his back.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai and Josh are entwined together. Josh is snoring. They
          are both blissfully asleep...
                         
          ...for now.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Another day, another chaotic breakfast.
                         
          Foster waves a stuffed toy around. Josh charges in, bits of
          tissue on his face from shaving cuts. Cali flails her arms in
          her high chair. Renai is at the sink, whisking eggs.
                         
                          RENAI
           Foster, sit down honey.
                         
          She whips a look around.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Where is...? Hey Josh, could you go
           wake up Dalton?
                         
          We FOLLOW Josh as he marches down the corridor to Dalton's
          bedroom, poking his head inside.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh knocks on the wall.
                         
                          JOSH
           Time to get up, my man. Come on.
                         
          Nothing from Dalton. He doesn't even stir. Josh rolls his
          eyes and walks in. Nudges Dalton with his knee.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You're making me look bad here.
           Outta bed before your mother comes
           in and kills both of us.
           21.
                         
                         
          Nothing. He's really out.
                         
          Josh reaches down and shakes Dalton vigorously.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton, get up. You've gotta get
           ready for school.
                         
          Josh waits for a response, but none comes. Dalton is as slack
          as a puppet. Something resembling concern crosses Josh's face.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton...?
                         
          He kneels down, shaking Dalton hard. He listens for breathing.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton? Dalton?! DALTON!!
                         
          His scream takes us into--
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, ICU UNIT - DAY
                         
          --the stern sterility of a hospital.
                         
          Josh and Renai, eyes lined by dark circles, stand in front of
          a dour neurologist, DR. JOEL SERCARZ (46).
                         
          Renai dabs her eyes with a tissue. They are red with tears.
          Beyond a window in front of them, lying on a gurney in an ICU
          chamber, is the unconscious body of Dalton.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           Okay...as of yet, our tests have
           not drawn any conclusive answers
           for you. Repeated blood and CSF
           cultures are normal, making an
           infective origin highly unlikely.
           Tests for Lyme disease and repeated
           polymerase chain reaction are
           negative. Systemic vasculitis was
           ruled out. Dalton remains in an
           areactive coma without focal signs
           or abnormal brainstem reflexes.
                         
          Josh and Renai struggle to follow the cold, multi-syllable
          medical terminology...like stranded tourists keeping up with
          a foreign language.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           We've looked for bacterial
           pathogens like Meningoencephalitis,
           but haven't seen anything.
                          (MORE)
           22.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           I wouldn't say we've exhausted
           every single angle...but we're
           close. The underlying cause is
           still unknown.
                         
          Josh and Renai look in at their boy.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           The good news is that he's
           breathing without the use of a
           mechanical apparatus, and there are
           no lesions or hemorrhages in any of
           the CT scans.
                         
                          JOSH
           So...there's no brain damage or...?
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           None that we've detected. Technically,
           he's in a coma. He doesn't respond to
           stimuli, he has no sleep-wake cycle, but
           there's no brain trauma or infection. His
           scans are normal. To be honest, I've
           never seen anything like it.
                         
                          JOSH
           That fall he took...I mean, it looked
           like he hit his head pretty hard.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           We definitely exhausted that
           possibility, but it was always
           doubtful. The cut was superficial,
           there wasn't even a skull fracture.
                         
                          RENAI
           He can't just not wake up...there's
           got to be something...
                         
          Renai sobs, tears streaming down her face. Josh looks like a
          deer in the headlights. Stunned dumb.
                         
          Sercarz clears his throat. This part of the job isn't his
          specialty.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          JOSH
           So what do we do now? Does he stay here?
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           We'll conduct some further testing, but
           beyond that...I really don't know.
           23.
                         
                         
          His pager goes off. He checks it.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           Excuse me for a minute. I have to
           step out. A nurse will be with you
           in just a moment.
                         
          He leaves quickly. Josh and Renai press on the glass,
          separated in body and spirit from their son.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, LAMBERT HOME - DAY
                         
          A ghastly meld of hospital room and young boys bedroom.
                         
          Dalton lies on his bed, a heart rate monitor hooked to his
          chest. IV tubes run into his arms, a Nasogastric feeding tube
          into his mouth.
                         
          A young nurse, ADELE CHALFIN (30), checks the various tubes
          as Renai watches on.
                         
                          ADELE
           Are you having any more trouble
           with the feeding tube?
                         
          Renai looks broken, the life drained from her. A wilted flower.
          She shakes her head, her voice a low rasp.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (BARELY AUDIBLE)
           It's okay.
                         
                          ADELE
           Alright, well I'll be back soon.
           I'll bring some new books. You're
           probably sick of the ones you have.
                         
                          RENAI
           Did he respond to any of the tests?
                         
          Adele pauses.
                         
                          ADELE
           No...no, he didn't. But we have to
           give it time. I've seen coma
           patients with a much longer
           inactivity time suddenly start
           making noises.
           24.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           He's not in a coma, remember? They
           don't know what to call it. They
           don't know what to do with him so
           they've given up.
                         
                          ADELE
           No, they haven't. We're going to
           figure it out.
                         
          Adele hugs her, then exits. Renai slumps down on a chair next
          to her son.
                         
          The heart rate monitor pings. Dalton is as still as a statue.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
                         
          Renai shuffles down the corridor. She passes a bedroom door,
          then stops and doubles back, pushing it open and going into--
                         
                         
          INT. CALI'S NURSERY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --the babies room.
                         
          She stares into the crib...at her other sleeping baby. She
          sets the baby monitor and walks out softly.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Renai slumps in front of her piano. Taps one of the keys.
                         
          She plays a discordant melody of low notes with one hand, not
          present enough to hear it.
                         
          She stops and buries her face in her hands.
                         
          Then she hears it. Whispering.
                         
          It's so low you would miss it if the house wasn't absolutely
          silent. Renai looks up, scanning for the source of the murmur.
                         
          It is coming from the baby monitor.
                         
          Confused, Renai picks up the monitor, turning up the volume
          all the way up. The hissssssss of static fills the room.
                         
          She presses her ear to the device, then hears it again - a
          hushed WHISPER, almost indistinct from the static save for
          the whistle of sibilants.
           25.
                         
                         
                          VOICE
                          (FROM MONITOR)
           They see us...all of us...we have to be
           quick...this life begs us to come back.
                         
          The whisper trails off....more static...
                         
                          VOICE (CONT'D)
                          (FROM MONITOR)
           NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
                         
          Renai drops the baby monitor, leaping out of her skin at the
          sound of the scream. Nerves fried.
                         
          The monitor smashes on the floor. All is quiet.
                         
          Renai moves to the door, staring down the corridor at the
          door to Cali's nursery.
                         
          It is open only a crack. She hears crying. Cali is crying.
                         
          We follow her as she bolts towards the nursery, smashing
          through the door, eyes filled with terror, seeing--
                         
          --nothing.
                         
                         
          INT. NURSERY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai stalks into the room.
                         
          The room is empty, save for Cali, crying in her crib. Renai's
          eyes land on the closet.
                         
          ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE CLOSET
                         
          Through a slight crack, we see Renai approach. Breath
          quivering. Her hand reaches out. She FLINGS the door open.
                         
          It is empty.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          The family is eating. It's very quiet.
                         
          Foster keeps his eyes down as his parents eat in silence.
          Suddenly Cali breaks the quiet, squealing happily.
                         
                          CALI
           Dadda!
                         
          Josh looks up, smiling. Amazed.
           26.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           She said dad...
                         
          Neither Renai nor Foster even look up.
                         
                         
          INT. FOSTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A bedside lamp gives off a jaundice glow.
                         
          Renai gathers up scattered toys from the floor, relocating
          them to a desktop covered in beakers and lab equipment.
                         
          Foster lies in bed beneath a large chart of the solar system.
                         
          Renai stops cleaning when she finds a certificate, crumpled
          next to a school bag. It says IN RECOGNITION OF SCIENCE
          SKILL, AWARDED TO FOSTER LAMBERT ON 3/14/10.
                         
                          RENAI
           What's this?
                         
                          FOSTER
           An award.
                         
                          RENAI
           That's today's date. You got this
           today?
                         
          Foster nods meekly.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Why didn't you tell us, honey?
                         
          She sits on the edge of his bed. He stares at the wall. She
          strokes his hair.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           I know it's hard right now. But
           things will get better. I promise.
                         
          Foster nods.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           I'm going to show this to your dad.
                         
          She plants a kiss his forehead and stands up.
                         
                          FOSTER
           I'm scared, mom.
                         
                          RENAI
           Scared of what?
           27.
                         
                         
                          FOSTER
           Dalton.
                         
          Renai sits back down.
                         
                          RENAI
           We're all scared. It's normal to be
           scared for him. But we can't give up--
                         
                          FOSTER
           Why do I have to sleep so close to
           him? Can't I change rooms?
                         
                          RENAI
           Why would you wanna change rooms?
                         
          Foster swallows.
                         
                          FOSTER
           I don't know.
                         
          Renai stares at her son. She kisses him again.
                         
                          RENAI
           Your brother needs you. Goodnight
           honey.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh lies in bed, reading Foster's award. Renai is beside him.
                         
                          RENAI
           Something happened today. I didn't
           want to tell you in front of Foster.
                         
                          JOSH
           What?
                         
                          RENAI
           I heard something coming from
           Cali's room. A man's voice. On the
           baby monitor...it scared the hell
           outta me. I went in there and no
           one was there.
                         
                          JOSH
           Could it have been interference?
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't know. It was so clear. I
           was sitting at the piano and I
           heard this...whispering on the baby
           monitor. So I held my ear up to it--
           28.
                         
                         
          SUDDENLY - a noise interrupts. An arrhythmic KNOCKING sound,
          like a drunk pounding on a tavern door after closing.
                         
          It is the front door.
                         
                          JOSH
           Who the hell is that?
                         
          Josh knows it's his job to check, but he doesn't want to.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Stay here.
                         
          He gets up.
                         
                         
          INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
                         
          Josh approaches the front door, flashlight in hand. He peers
          through curtains at the front step.
                         
          It's too dark to see anything.
                         
                          JOSH
           Hello? Who's there?
                         
          Only the wind replies.
                         
          He aims the flashlight at the glass, shining it into the
          thick darkness. There is no one on the front step.
                         
          Josh presses the flashlight against the window, arcing the
          beam across his front garden. Leans in close to the glass...
                         
                         AND THEN--
                         
          Nothing. There's no one there.
                         
          He makes sure the door is locked, then flips open a security
          system panel on the wall, pecking at the buttons on it.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai sits up in bed, listening. Hears nothing...
                         
          ...until the low moans of a baby crying float out of the baby
          monitor. Renai hurls the sheet aside.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Renai pads down the hall, tentative.
           29.
                         
                         
          She reaches the open door to Cali's room. Sees the silhouette
          of Josh standing over Cali's crib. Exhales with relief.
                         
                          RENAI
           Who was it, Josh?
                         
          Josh appears at the opposite end of the hallway.
                         
                          JOSH
           What did you say?
                         
          Renai SCREAMS as the silhouette recedes into the shadows.
                         
                          RENAI
           There's someone in there!
                         
          She RUNS towards Josh.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           There's someone in Cali's room!
                         
          Josh BOLTS down the hall, flicking on the light, terrified.
                         
          The nursery is empty. Cali is sleeping. Terrified, Josh
          enters the room. Scans around. Only toys and colorful
          wallpaper.
                         
          He steps in further. He's not cut out for this.
                         
          SHRIEEEEEEEEEEEKKKK!!!!!! SHRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!!!!!
                         
          The house alarm screams to deafening life, shaving a few
          years off Josh's life in the process. He JOLTS, whipping
          around.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (TO RENAI)
           Grab Cali and Foster!
                         
          Josh charges down the hall into the--
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --snatching up a fire poker from the fireplace and continuing--
                         
                         
          INT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          -- to the front door, which is swinging open. Holding the
          fire poker aloft, Josh scans the area.
                         
          Renai races past, carrying Cali and dragging Foster behind
          her. They barrel toward Dalton's room.
           30.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh scans the kitchen. It is empty.
                         
          The alarm wails in the background.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh inches his way up the hall, hand shaking.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai holds Foster and Cali close to her. Dalton is lying
          behind them.
                         
          Directly across from Dalton's room is the laundry. The door
          is ajar, offering a view into the darkened room beyond.
                         
          Renai sees something in the dark...a figure. A boy.
                         
          It looks like Dalton. He reaches out to Renai--
                         
          --until another HAND...a pale hand...reaches across and shuts
          the laundry door, sealing the boy off from her view.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh! The laundry!
                         
                         
          INT. LAUNDRY - SAME TIME
                         
          Josh bolts up the hall, panicked. He reaches the laundry
          door, grabbing the handle. Hesitates.
                         
          He propels the door open with a shove, flicking on the light.
                         
          The room is empty. No windows, no doors for escape...just a
          washing machine and a dryer.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          A home security officer trudges down the steps of the house.
                         
          Renai, Josh, Foster and Cali all stand outside in their
          pajamas, shivering in the frigid night air.
                         
                          SECURITY OFFICER
           There's no one in there, it's all
           clear. If someone was there, they're
           gone now.
           31.
                         
                         
          Renai steps away from the children, out of their earshot.
                         
                          RENAI
           I saw somebody.
                         
                          SECURITY OFFICER
           Maybe it was a shadow...?
                         
                          RENAI
           No. It wasn't a shadow, it was a
           man. He was tall, and he long,
           greasy hair. He was wearing a grey
           jacket. He looked right at me.
                         
                          SECURITY OFFICER
           Well, like I said...he's gone now.
                         
          Renai looks to the others. Sees only disbelieving faces.
                         
                         
          INT. GYMNASIUM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Josh's students scuffle about on stadium seating, arranging
          themselves for a CLASS PHOTO. They're not doing a great job.
                         
          A male photographer does his best to compose them, not doing a
          great job of hiding his bitterness about the fact that he's
          shooting school photos instead of Vanity Fair spreads.

           Okay, face the front ladies and
           gentlemen...come on...hold still...
           (muttering to himself)
           I'm trying to record the peak of
           your pathetic lives here.
                         
          Josh stands off to the side, lost in his own thoughts. Tired.
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
           Mr. Lambert, would you like to step
           in please?
                         
          Josh snaps out of his own head.
                         
                          JOSH
           Uh...what?
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER
           Could you step in so that we can
           take the photo? Quickly please.
                         
                          JOSH
           Just take it without me.
           32.
                         
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER
           We need you in the photo, sir.
                         
                          JOSH
           No, you don't. Just take the damn
           photo without me, okay?
                         
          The class settles down, shocked by the outburst. Chastened,
          the photographer turns to the class, gripping the camera
          trigger.
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER
           I can't believe this is my life.
           (beat; to class)
           Ready kids? Say asshole teacher!
                         
                         
          INT. GYMNASIUM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - LATER
                         
          The students file out of the gym. Josh sits in the bleachers,
          head buried in his hands.
                         
           ALANSO (O.S.)
           I hear things.
                         
          Josh looks up, seeing Alanso.
                         
                          JOSH
           What?
                         
                          ALANSO
           I spend so much time in the office,
           I hear things. I heard about your
           son. I'm sorry.
                         
                          JOSH
           Thank you, Alanso.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Times like these...people realize
           that science doesn't have all the
           answers. There is a higher force at
           work.
                         
                          JOSH
           I wish I had your belief. Things
           would be a lot simpler.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Things are simple. You just can't
           see it. Put your faith in Him.
                         
          He places his gold cross necklace in Josh's hand, then leaves.
          Josh watches him go, then takes out his cell phone.
           33.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Hey...I just found out I have to
           stay back tonight and finish off
           mid-term grades. It could be a
           while, there's a lot to go through.
           Don't wait up. Bye.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARK - NIGHT
                         
          Josh sits on a park bench, staring into the distance. He
          takes out a flask of whisky, swigging from it.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Alone.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Renai shuffles in, pouring herself a glass of water. Then she
          hears it. A low muttering. It is coming from Dalton's room.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Unnerved, Renai peers through the open door. Josh is sitting
          beside Dalton's bed, reading to him.
                         
                          JOSH
           The men all walked down to the
           waters edge...and they stood there
           and asked the beast to come forth.
           And the beast roared back "No!". And
           so they dived in after it...
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME
                         
          In the sunlight, the house looks like a happy place.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Dalton's face is a picture of serenity.
                         
          A new day-shift nurse, KELLY (29), checks on his feeding
          tube. Renai watches from the doorway.
                         
                          KELLY
           You okay?
           34.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Yeah.
                         
                          KELLY
           I was going to head off for an hour
           or so. Are you alright here?
                         
                          RENAI
           Of course. Anything from Dalton?
                         
                          KELLY
           No. I'm sorry.
                         
          Renai nods. Her eyes brim with tears. The cracks are showing.
                         
                          KELLY (CONT'D)
           Keep providing him with stimuli. I've
           seen it work time and time again.
           Read to him. Even if you're doing
           something else, you can play him
           music that he likes. Don't give up.
                         
          She throws a scarf over her shoulder and stands.
                         
                          RENAI
           I won't, I just...I haven't slept
           much the last couple of nights. I
           feel like the universe is trying to
           see how far I can bend before I
           break.
                         
                          KELLY
           The universe picked a fight with
           the wrong chick.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thanks, Kelly. You're a saint.
                         
                          KELLY
           No, I'm not. I'm doing my job. I
           chose to be here. You didn't choose
           any of this. You're the strong one.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Renai surveys the living room. It is a total mess.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          Water cascades out of a faucet. Steam rises from the water.
           35.
                         
                         
          Renai lets bath salts fall into the tub. She almost looks
          relaxed just smelling them.
                         
          She starts to undress, then turns --
                         
          -- and YELPS in fright.
                         
          A person is standing behind the distorted glass window,
          staring in at her.
                         
          The shape of the person's head and shoulders can clearly be
          seen, but the glass is too opaque to make out any features.
                         
          Renai slips, grabbing the sink. When she glances up, the
          figure is gone.
                         
          Trembling, Renai opens the window. Very, very slowly.
                         
          It is fifteen feet off the ground, with a sheer drop below it.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Renai sits on the front steps, alone. It is late. She looks
          somehow tired and wired at the same time. Smoking a cigarette.
                         
          Josh pulls in. Fumbles out of his car, tipsy.
                         
                          JOSH
           What are you doing up?
                         
                          RENAI
           It's midnight, Josh.
                         
                          JOSH
           When did you start smoking?
                         
                          RENAI
           You've been coming home late every
           single night. You've never had to
           do that in all of the years you've
           been at the school. Now all of a
           sudden you have to stay back late?
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't like it either, but I'm
           grading tests. What choice do I have?
           We've gotta pay Dalton's bills.
                         
                          RENAI
           Your mother is paying Dalton's
           bills, Josh. I know because she
           reminds me every chance she gets.
           36.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           Jesus, I can't win with you. That's
           my son in there too, not just yours!
                         
          He paces, the anger sobering him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I've always felt like less than
           good enough for you. I feel it
           every time you mention our bills.
           That subtle voice that says `can't
           you get a job that pays more than a
           teacher'? And now I can't even look
           at you without feeling it.
                         
                          RENAI
           You're projecting that onto me.
           You've written an entire story
           about I'm how I'm feeling without
           once asking me how I'm feeling.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't need to ask. I know you.
                         
                          RENAI
           I am losing my mind here in this
           house, Josh. I'm scared and I need
           you and you're not here. Where are
           you?
                         
                          JOSH
           I told you, I'm grading tests.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't mean that. I mean you're
           not here. With me. In this
           situation. You're avoiding it, like
           you do anything stressful, whether
           it's this or a parking ticket.
                         
                          JOSH
           Christ, I should have stayed at the
           school.
                         
                          RENAI
           There you go again.
                         
          Renai stands up and walks inside the house. The door closes.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh tosses a pillow onto the couch, setting himself up for
          the night. He curls up on it, pulling a blanket over himself.
           37.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          The witching hour. Still. Quiet...save for the omnipresent
          clock.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton is as still as we've seen him. And then...he twitches.
          A slight facial twitch, but we see it.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh snoozes, head arched at a bad angle. His back will
          regret sleeping on this couch.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai tosses and turns, restless in sleep.
                         
          Her eyes open and she sucks in a breath. Bad dreams.
                         
          She blinks and looks around the room, surprised to be alone,
          sitting up in fright. Until she remembers why. She eases back
          onto the bed. Then she looks over at the window.
                         
          There is a man standing outside it.
                         
          He is not looking in at her...he is pacing back and forth,
          furiously smoking a cigarette. Back and forth, back and
          forth. Agitated. He has long, black, greasy hair and a grey
          jacket.
                         
          Every muscle in Renai's body freezes. She becomes a glacier.
                         
          Her eyes are drilled to the man, unable to move. By sheer
          will, she manages to direct them towards the bedroom door.
          Opens her mouth but no words will come. Finally--
                         
                          RENAI
           Jo....osh....Josh....Josh...
                         
          She glances back at the window.
                         
          THE MAN IS NOW IN THE ROOM.
                         
          He paces back and forth between the bed and the window, just
          as he was outside, ignoring Renai. Smoking like a fiend.
                         
          And then, suddenly, he stops pacing. Looks up. Straight at
          Renai - as if just realizing she was there.
           38.
                         
                         
          For a moment their eyes are locked in silence...
                         
          ...and then the man's face contorts in anger and he CHARGES
          towards her, arms outstretched, GROWLING in fury.
                         
                          MAN
           DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE!
                         
          Renai lets out a SHRIEK of terror that could strip paint. A
          cry from the depths of her soul.
                         
          She propels herself backward, falling off the bed and
          scrambling back into the corner.
                         
          Josh CHARGES into the room, flicking on the light--
                         
          --seeing only Renai, huddled in the corner, screaming.
                         
                          JOSH
           What is it? What is it?!
                         
          Renai is incoherent. She cannot stop screaming. Josh grabs
          her by the shoulders.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Renai, what is wrong?!
                         
                          RENAI
           The man -- he was there -- he tried
           to -- there was a man there!!!
                         
          Foster runs into the room, visibly terrified. He sees his
          mother and instantly begins crying. He runs to his dad,
          holding onto his leg.
                         
          In the background, Cali begins crying, her screams
          contributing to an overwhelming din.
                         
                          JOSH
           There's no one here.
                         
                          RENAI
           I saw somebody!
                         
                          JOSH
           There's no one here.
                         
                          RENAI
           Don't you dare not believe me!
                         
                          JOSH
           I believe you, okay? I just don't
           know what you want me to do.
           39.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           I want you to tell me that we can
           leave this house. I will not spend
           one more night here. I wanna leave,
           I wanna go!
                         
                          FOSTER
           I don't want the man to get me.
                         
          The realization that her child is terrified quiets Renai.
                         
          All is suddenly silent, save for the cries of Cali in the
          background. Josh holds his son tight.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're okay, buddy. I've got you.
                         
          He and Renai exchange a look.
                         
                          RENAI
           I'm sorry.
                          (BEAT)
           I can't...I want to leave this
           house. I can't be here anymore.
                         
                          JOSH
           To move now would be...we would
           have to rent somewhere. It's not--
                         
                          RENAI
           Please, Josh.
                         
                         
          An agreement passes between them.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A moving truck is parked outside an average suburban home.
                         
          Movers mill about, hauling boxes and couches.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Renai unpacks boxes. An elderly woman, LORRAINE (65), helps to
          unpack. This is Josh's mother. She has a curt, disapproving
          manner about her that doesn't always make her easy to love.
                         
          She is actually moving more quickly than Renai, who groans as
          if her back were aching as she stoops down to pick up books.
           40.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Lorraine, you shouldn't have to do
           any of this. Sit down.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           Nonsense. I'm perfectly capable of
           putting a few things away. I did it
           for Josh his whole life. He never
           was good with tidying up.
                         
                          RENAI
           I know, but I just feel so bad.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I think it's you who should be
           sitting down by the looks of it.
                         
          She boosts a photo frame from one of the boxes. It is a
          portrait of Renai, Dalton, Foster and Josh. In happier times.
                         
          Lorraine seems taken aback by it.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           I can't believe you got Josh to sit
           still for a photo.
                         
          Renai reclines against the wall, surveying her new living
          room. Her new new house.
                         
                          RENAI
           I can't believe we're doing all this
           again, that's what I can't believe.
           (beat; looks at her)
           I know you think I'm crazy.
                         
          Lorraine stops unpacking and fixes Renai with a stare. They've
          never really gotten along before. Adversity has brought about
          a truce.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           Nobody - not me, not anybody -
           knows what you're going through
           right now. Whatever you have to do
           to get through it, do it. And never
           apologize for it.
                         
          Renai hugs her. It's a new thing for them and a bit awkward.
                         
                         
          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          DR. BRYCE TRIMBLE (52) sits opposite Renai and Josh. Spread
          out in front of him are a series of X-Rays, labelled DALTON
          LAMBERT. His office is big and expensive.
           41.
                         
                         
          Renai looks hopeful. Josh looks like a shell of a man.
                         
                          RENAI
           We just wanna say...thank you so
           much. For helping us out with this,
           doctor. We can't tell you how much
           it means to have you involved.
                         
           DR. TRIMBLE
           I'm glad to help.
                          (BEAT)
           Unfortunately...these recent tests
           have proven inconclusive. There's
           absolutely nothing abnormal here.
                         
          Josh and Renai deflate.
                         
                          JOSH
           So...if you're the top of the food
           chain with this stuff, where does
           that leave us?
                         
           DR. TRIMBLE
           I don't know. There is a research
           team in Boston who specialize in a
           new form of treatment. They try to
           stimulate the patients brain with
           electric pulses. It has a good
           success rate with victims of brain
           injury. We could try that.
                         
                          RENAI
           So there's hope?
                         
           DR. TRIMBLE
           There are more things we can try.
                          (BEAT)
           The hope part is up to you.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Renai sits beside Dalton. Staring at him. She runs her
          fingers through his hair, touching his skin.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A needle touches an LP.
                         
          The pops and crackles of record hiss spit forth, followed by
          the lilting guitar strums of `Tip Toe Through The Tulips'.
                         
          The quavering falsetto of Tiny Tim accompanies the guitar.
           42.

           Tip-toe by the window, by the
           window, that is where I'll be...
                         
          Renai walks away and we follow her down the hall into --
                         
                         
          INT. FOSTER'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          -- a mess as only a child can make.
                         
          Renai picks up a plate and a fork and knife from the floor.
          She walks out and we DON'T CUT, tracking with her --
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          continues warbling in the background.

                          (FROM RECORD)
           Oh tip-toe, from the garden, by the
           garden, of the willow tree...
                         
          Renai passes the living room.
                         
          What she doesn't see is the child standing in the middle of
          the room, facing the record player.
                         
          The boy is dressed in clothes from another time, but
          children's clothes just the same.
                         
          He is dancing awkwardly, shifting his weight from one foot to
          foot the other sheepishly, as if trying it for the first
          time.
                         
          Renai keeps walking and we stay with her as she moves past
          the child, following her into the --
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          -- mess of the kitchen.
                         
          She sets the plate down in the sink, on top of a stack of
          other dirty dishes.
                         
          With a sigh she runs the hot water over the dishes.
                         
          With a sudden POP, the record starts skipping.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
           43.
                         
                         
          Renai shuts off the water, heading back to the living room.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          She marches in, annoyed.
                         
          Then freezes.
                         
          Her bookshelf is empty. The books that once sat on it are now
          scattered across the floor.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          Renai scans the books.
                         THEN
                         SHE
                         HEARS
          it...
                         
          Giggling.
                         
          She pivots her head towards the darkened hallway. There, she
          sees a child, hidden in shadow, standing in the hall. Staring
          at her.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          Renai doesn't move. Doesn't breathe.
                         
          And then suddenly, the child turns and runs down the hall,
          disappearing into Dalton's bedroom.
                         
                          RENAI
           Oh my God, Dalton...no...
                         
          Summoning every ounce of strength, Renai troops down the hall
          towards Dalton's room.

          Renai pushes the door open.
                         
          Dalton lies in the center of the room on his gurney. The only
          sound is his breathing.
                         
          Renai surveys the room. It is empty.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          She steps inside, glancing over at a cabinet. In the foot-
          high space beneath it, a small white shoe protrudes slightly.
           44.
                         
                         
          A child's shoe.
                         
          Heart pounding, Renai bends down, peering into the darkness
          under the cabinet.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          The shoe does not have a foot in it. It is simply a discarded
          shoe. There is no one under the cabinet.
                         
          BANG!!!
                         BA G
                         
          The cabinet doors EXPLODE open as the child bursts out,
          giggling. Only we see that it is not a child.
                         
          It is a DWARF. A man in child's clothing. The dwarf runs past
          Renai as she LEAPS back. He runs out of the room, giggling.
          All is quiet again.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          Renai gets up, unsure of what to do. Numb with terror.
                         
          SUDDENLY-- the record pitches back to life, the volume
          startling. Renai JOLTS, falling backwards.
                         
                         
          INT. CLASSROOM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT
                         
          A darkened class room.
                         
          An older janitor, NED (68), shoulders the door open, carrying a
          mop. He STARTS when he sees Josh, sitting at his desk in the
          pale light of a desk lamp. Alone.
                         
                          NED
           Josh...didn't see you there.
                         
                          JOSH
           Sorry to scare you.
                         
                          NED
           What are you up to this late?
                         
          Josh holds up his flask of whisky. He's a bit soused.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where did all the bartenders who
           listen to your troubles go, Ned?
                         
          Ned nods sagely. He sets down his mop and grabs a chair,
          sitting in front of Josh with a sigh. He takes the flask.
           45.
                         
                         
                          NED
           Never drink alone. If you take the
           dirty jokes out of drunkenness, all
           you're left with is the self loathing.
                         
          He downs a hit from the flask, then hands it back.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't need whisky for that.
                         
                          NED
           Bah. You people think too much.
           Used to be, if life threw a
           shitstorm at you, you'd grab the
           nearest umbrella. Your generation
           would spend a day googling what
           brand to buy.
                         
          Josh laughs despite himself.
                         
                          JOSH
           I probably would too.
           (beat; takes a drink)
           It's funny, I've always known I was
           the type of person that things
           didn't happen to. I made peace with
           it. I thought to myself, it's okay -
           I'll never win the lottery or climb
           Mount Everest...but I'll never get
           a rare tropical blood disease
           either. It works out.
                          (BEAT)
           Now I'm the guy whose son is in a
           mysterious coma.
                         
                          NED
           Things happen to everybody. Even to
           good people like you. And they're
           gonna keep happening the older you
           get, believe me. No use sittin' in
           the dark drinkin' over it. Go home.
           Be with your wife. Tell her your
           what's on your mind.
                         
          He takes the flask and has another swig.
                         
                          NED (CONT'D)
           There sure as hell isn't any
           umbrellas `round here.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Josh pulls up to the house. Turns off the car.
           46.
                         
                         
          An old Cadillac is sitting in the driveway. Josh clambers out
          of his car and peers in through the window of the Cadillac,
          quizzical.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai is huddled on the couch in the living room, gripping her
          knees to her chest. A man is sitting next to her; a handsome,
          soft-spoken Anglican priest, FATHER NATHANSON (40).
                         
          Josh enters. There are subtle changes in his coordination and
          speech from the booze.
                         
                          JOSH
           This is the first line of a joke.
           Guy comes home to find his wife
           with a priest...
                         
          Father Nathanson stands, as does Renai.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh, this is Liam Nathanson. A
           very old friend of mine.
                         
                          FATHER NATHANSON
           Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot
           about you.
                         
                          JOSH
           Can't say I've heard the same,
           Liam. At least I know you're not
           sleeping with her.
                         
           LORRAINE (O.S.)
           Don't be rude, Josh.
                         
          Josh turns to see his mother, holding a tray of tea. He frowns.
                         
                          JOSH
           What is going on here?
                         
                          FATHER NATHANSON
           I should be going. Thank you so much
           for the tea.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thanks, Liam.
                         
          He clears his throat and exits, quickly and quietly.
                         
                          JOSH
           Okay, would anyone mind telling me
           what the hell is going on here?
           47.
                         
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Please sit down, Joshua.
                         
                          JOSH
          "Joshua?" Oh Jesus...
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Sit down.
                         
                          JOSH
          The melodramatic way in which you
          two are conducting yourselves right
          now is scaring the shit out of me,
          so just tell me what's wrong.
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Nothing is wrong. We want to talk.
                         
                          JOSH
          Nobody asks you to sit down unless
          something is wrong. If a doctor
          calls you into his office and asks
          you to sit down, you're fucked.
                         
                          RENAI
          There's no use, Lorraine. He's been
          drinking.
                         
                          JOSH
          I have not been drinking. Not
          enough that we can't talk to each
          other, Renai. And don't judge me in
          that bitchy tone, okay?
                         
                          RENAI
                          (TO LORRAINE)
          He would never speak to me like
          that before.
                         
                          JOSH
          Christ. You're acting like I'm some
          lush who comes home and beats you
          with a belt. At least I'm speaking
          to you. You suddenly have to speak
          to a priest. Or my mother who, up
          until a couple of weeks ago, you
          couldn't stand.
                         
                          RENAI
          You're an asshole.
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Your wife needs you. Now sit down and
          listen to her. I won't ask you again.
           48.
                         
                         
          Josh obeys. His mothers tone can still shut him up.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           Go on, Renai. Tell him.
                         
                          RENAI
           This...thing that was in the other
           house. It followed us.
                         
          Josh shifts in his seat. Agitated.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           Let her speak.
                         
                          RENAI
           I saw someone again today. In the
           house. It looked like a young boy.
           I followed it into Dalton's room...
           but it wasn't a child.
                          (BEAT)
           This thing is here. I know it.
                         
                          JOSH
           So...what? You called in a priest
           to get rid of it?
                         
                          RENAI
           I didn't know what else to do.
                         
                          JOSH
           Are you kidding me?
                          (TO LORRAINE)
           Was this your idea?
                         
                          RENAI
           No. It was mine.
                         
                          JOSH
           You've never been to a church in
           your life. Now you're inviting a
           priest into our home? I feel like I
           don't even know you right now.
                         
                          RENAI
           I'm scared.
                         
                          JOSH
           This is a fantasy, and you need a
           therapist, not a member of the
           clergy.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (TO LORRAINE)
           I told you...
           49.
                         
                         
                          LORRAINE
           What's happening to Renai is real.
           I've seen it for myself.
                          (BEAT)
           I came here today because last night
           I had a dream about this place.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          We are FLOATING through the corridor, looking through
          Lorraine's POV.
                         
          We are inside her dream.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.)
           I was in this house...but it was
           late at night.
                         
          The POV keeps moving, out of the kitchen and into the hall.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I tried to be quiet. I didn't want
           to wake anybody. I was afraid.
                         
          The POV floats down the hall, reaching a door. The door
          opens, revealing Josh and Renai, sleeping.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I looked into your bedroom. You
           were both asleep.
                         
          The POV keeps moving down the hall.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I knew that I was asleep in the
           dream...but I could feel that
           someone was awake in the house.
                         
          We keep pushing on, reaching the door to Dalton's room.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I went into Dalton's room.
                         
          The door pushes open. In the dark, we can see Dalton, in bed.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           There was someone in there with him.
                         
          The POV turns to see a DARK FIGURE, standing in the corner.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           A man was standing in the corner of
           the room.

           I asked him who he was...he said he
           was a visitor. I asked him what he
           wanted...he said Dalton.

          Lorraine is clearly unsettled by the dream.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I can still hear that voice.
                         
          She looks up at Josh - and SCREAMS!
                         
          Over Josh's shoulder, crouched down behind the couch and
          peeking up over the armrest at Lorraine, is a DIABOLICAL
          FIGURE. His face is PURE RED with smeared lipstick. His scalp
          is completely bald, yet tufts of hair dangle above his ears.
          Other than his face, his skin is charcoal black.
                         
          Lorraine recoils back, utterly petrified.
                         
                          JOSH
           What is it?
                         
          Lorraine stares eerily into his eyes. Frozen.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           He's here.
                         
          Renai looks to Josh, who is at a total loss. She is crying.
                         
                          RENAI
           Help us...
                         
          His anger fades and he steps over and takes her in his arms.
                         
                          JOSH

          The shorter one is a wiry young man who looks like he spends
          most of his time in dark rooms. Not a member of the beach
          volleyball team. This is SPECS (32).
                         
          The other is TUCKER (33), a larger man with scruffy facial
          hair. He is eating a Hot Pocket.

           I'm here to solve your problem. I'm
           just kidding with the voice. We

           we handle all the background stuff,

                          JOSH
           This is a little uncomfortable.
           Speaking for myself. I'm not used
           to this kind of stuff.

                          SPECS
           Right. I heard about this from
           Lorraine. He is in a coma, the

           Not a history. I've had bouts of
           it. In the past.
                         
          Renai is uncomfortable. Specs makes a note. The camera beeps.

          A long beat. Tucker finally enters, adjusts the camera.
                         
                          TUCKER
           (to Renai and Josh)
           He handles administration, I handle
           technical. It's an even split. He
           couldn't change a light bulb and I'm
           no good with paperwork. It bores me
           senseless.

          Tucker edges into the corridor. He switches out the light,
          then takes what looks like a modified VIEW-MASTER TOY out of
          his shoulder bag, holding it up to his eyes.

          He approaches the grandfather clock. Another slide clicks
          into place - showing us TWO FIGURES. Standing beside the
          clock.
                         
          In the negative light, they look like females.

           They're very good assistants but I
           can't get them to dress any better.
                         
                          RENAI
           Hi. I'm Renai.
                         
                          ELISE
           Pleased to meet you. I'm Elise.
                         
          Elise takes her hat off and scans the room, taking a deep
          breath. Tucker jabbers, eager to please.
                         
                          TUCKER
           We took Tri-field and EMF readings of
           the whole house. All the wiring,
           alarm clocks, radios, toasters, TV,
           record player, fuse box. Nothing went
           off the charts.
                         
                          ELISE
           And the previous home?
                         
          Tucker and Specs look at each other. Oh shit.
                         
                          SPECS
           Tucker hadn't monitored that yet. I
           could jump on that this afternoon
           if you like? Make up for lost time.
                         
                          TUCKER
           Yeah, but who would work the
           equipment? I'll need to be there.
           You know what, don't even sweat it.
           I'll make myself available.
                         
                          ELISE
           No, that's fine, gentlemen.
                         
          She stares up at the ceiling, as if seeing something they can't.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           I don't think bad wiring is the
           problem here.
                         
          She drifts over to the bookshelf, her hand landing on the stack
          of photo albums Renai looked through in the opening scene.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Hmm.
           57.
                         
                         
          Renai and Josh exchange a look.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           May I walk through the house?
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes. Of course.
                         
                          ELISE
           Steven, do you have your sketchbook?
                         
          Specs hurriedly fishes a sketchbook and pencil out of his bag.
                         
                          SPECS
           Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, yes. I
           do.
                         
                          ELISE
           Good. We're going to need it.
                         
                          RENAI
           What is it for?
                         
                          SPECS
           She tells me what she sees and I
           draw it. It's the most important
           part of her process.
                         
                          TUCKER
           His drawings and my photos comprise
           her visual records.
                         
                          SPECS
           Especially the drawings.
                         
                          TUCKER
           That's debatable.
                         
                          SPECS
           It's not debatable.
                         
                          TUCKER
           It is, but whatever.
                         
                          SPECS
           Onwards and upwards. Find me a ghost.
                         
          Elise begins walking through the house. Tucker and Specs
          trail her and we FOLLOW THEM into the--
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --hallway.
           58.
                         
                         
          Renai and Josh stay back, sheepish. Elise stalks forward at
          the front, surveying every nook and cranny of the house.
                         
          Elise stops suddenly. She is staring straight at a corner of
          the hallway, next to the grandfather clock.
                         
                          RENAI
           What is it?
                         
                          ELISE
           There is something here.
                         
                          TUCKER
           This is where I saw it.
                         
          Elise calmly mutters something to Specs in a low voice, but
          we have trouble hearing it - only snatches of key words.
                         
                          ELISE
           ...long hair...grey dress...her
           eyes are...
                         
          He immediately starts sketching. His line drawings are fast
          but detailed. Impressive.
                         
          He outlines the wall, the ceiling lamp, the grandfather
          clock.
                         
          And then something else...
                         
          Two young women. Standing next to the grandfather clock,
          dressed in Amish garb. Even in the roughness of the drawing,
          we can make out their pleading eyes and pale skin.
                         
          Tucker takes out a camera, snaps some shots. Josh and Renai
          step forward, seeing the sketch.
                         
          Elise keeps moving, heading straight for one door in
          particular. She stops, running her hand over the wood.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Do I have permission to enter this
           room?
                         
                          JOSH
           Go ahead.
                         
                          ELISE
           Maybe you could wait back there?
                         
          Josh and Renai hug each other. Tucker lowers the camera.
                         
          Elise grips the door handle and turns it.
           59.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          The door groans open.
                         
          Dalton is lying on his gurney, surrounded by the sluggish
          drone of hospital equipment. The curtains are drawn and the
          room is dark.
                         
          Elise hesitates...then steps inside.
                         
                          ELISE
           Leave the lights off.
                         
          Elise steps closer to Dalton. She runs her hands over his
          prone body. She shivers as she does.
                         
          A ripple of fear passes through her. Her breath quickens.
                         
          Slowly...very very slowly ...she gazes up at a corner of
          the ceiling. Her eyes WIDEN and the look on her face
                         SHOULD
                         BE
                         ABSOLUTE
          T E R R O R.
                         
          Her arm raises up, her finger extending and pointing at the
          corner she is glaring at.
                         
                          RENAI
           What is it? What do you see?
                         
          Elise cups her hand over her mouth and whispers to Specs,
          keeping her eyes GLUED to the far corner of the ceiling. We
          cannot hear what she is whispering.
                         
          Hand shaking, Specs feverishly starts to sketch. We cannot
          see what he is drawing.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           What do you see?!
                         
          The strokes of Specs' pencil become faster and rougher,
          keeping up with Elise's whispers. Sweat dots his forehead.
                         
          Tucker glances at the drawing and steps back instinctively.
          He holds up his Viewmaster.
                         
          POV THROUGH VIEWMASTER - we see the far corner of the ceiling
          change color as Tucker rotates the lenses inside...but
          nothing out of the ordinary appears. Just a ceiling.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Tell me!
           60.
                         
                         
          Suddenly, Renai charges forward, snatching the sketch book.
                         
          The drawing is of a hideous form - crouched in the corner of
          the ceiling, staring down at Dalton below. It is the RED-
          FACED DEMON Lorraine saw earlier.
                         
          His naked body is charcoal black...whilst also strangely
          translucent, the veins visible underneath the flesh. A
          corpulent stomach juts out, as if he were pregnant.
                         
          Terrified, Renai flicks on the light --
                         
          -- revealing nothing but an ordinary ceiling.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Elise holds court in the living room.
                         
          Renai and Josh hold each other, struggling to comprehend it all.
                         
                          ELISE
           I'm not sure if you are ready to
           hear this yet...but unfortunately I
           can't waste any time easing you
           into it. There is no time left.
                         
          She takes a deep breath, preparing herself.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           I want you to know that this is
           what I believe and it may
           contradict a previous medical
           diagnosis. However, you called me
           here and I am taking that as an
           acceptance of my readings.
                         
                          RENAI
           Go on.
                         
                          ELISE
           Your son...is not in a coma. His
           physical body is here, but his
           spiritual body is not.
                          (BEAT)
           The reason these disturbances
           followed you to a new home is
           because...it is not the house that
           is haunted. It is your son.
                         
          This is too much for Josh. Renai, however, wants to listen.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't understand...
           61.
                         
                         
          Elise considers what she is about to say carefully.
                         
                          ELISE
           Have you ever heard of astral
           projection?
                         
                          RENAI
           Out of body experiences?
                         
          Elise nods.
                         
                          ELISE
           I call them travellers. These are
           people with the ability to leave
           their physical body and travel to
           different places in an astral form.
           To some degree, we all have the
           ability to do it...but most of us
           subconsciously suppress it or don't
           know how to access it.
                         
          Josh shakes his head, agitated. Renai leans forward,
          desperate for an answer to her terror.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Dalton is...a very accomplished
           astral projector. He has been since
           he was very young. He's not afraid
           of his ability. And that lack of
           fear has led him to travel too far
           and become lost...
                         
                          RENAI
           Lost? Lost where?
                         
          Elise gazes up at the ceiling, as if looking into another world.
                         
                          ELISE
           In The Further.
                         
                          RENAI
           What do you mean?
                         
                          ELISE
           The Further is that place beyond our
           perception, beyond our understanding
           of the physical world that we can see
           and touch. It is a place without
           clocks or measurements, without past
           or future...an infinite realm that
           holds all of our dreams...and all of
           our nightmares.
                         
          She turns to look at them.
           62.
                         
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           That is where Dalton is.
                         
          Renai cries, unprepared for what she is hearing.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           The problem is that with his astral
           body gone, he has left a physical
           body with us. An empty vessel.
                         
          Josh can't meet her gaze.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           And there are entities that know
           this. They can smell it - the
           chance to live again. That is why
           they have gathered around him.
                         
                          RENAI
           How many are there?
                         
                          ELISE
           There are five benevolent spirits.
           Five different entities for whom
           Dalton has become a most prized
           possession. They are trying to get
           inside his physical body...and they
           get closer with each passing day.
                         
          Her words hang in the air like gunsmoke. Pure fear courses
          through Josh's eyes. He fidgets, agitated.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Then there are two entities who
           are...not benevolent. One of them
           takes the form of a man, the
           other...
                         
          She holds up the drawing that Specs di.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           They work together, so desperate
           are they to possess Dalton. They
           are the closest of all the entities
           to getting inside him.
                          (BEAT)
           I don't want to scare you, but I
           have never, in all my years of
           doing this, experienced anything as
           terrifying as their presence.
                         
                          RENAI
           Is there a way to bring Dalton back?
           63.
                         
                         
                          ELISE
           There is something we could try. A
           way of calling him back. I would
           need your complete trust.
                         
          Josh can't take it any more. He stands up.
                         
                          JOSH
           No. No. This has gone too far.
                         
                          RENAI
           You said that you'd give her a chance!
                         
                          JOSH
           I have given her a chance, and I
           did that because I wanted to help
           you. But I cannot have somebody
           telling us that the reason our son
           is in a coma is because his soul is
           floating off somewhere in another
           dimension.
                         
                          ELISE
           I know this is hard to hear.
                         
                          JOSH
           No, it's not fair is what it is.
           You're preying on people's grief and
           vulnerability, which is really easy
           to do in a situation like this.
                         
                          RENAI
           Why did we go to all the trouble of
           bringing them here if you're just
           going to reject what they say?
                         
                          JOSH
           Because I wanted to help you. To
           put your mind at ease, and if this
           helped, then great. But to drag
           Dalton into this? No.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh, you're not being fair...
                         
                          JOSH
           Fair? How did the voice of reason
           become the bad guy here? Don't you
           see? You want to believe. Of course
           you do, honey, anybody would.
                         
          The room goes quiet. Josh turns to Elise.
           64.
                         
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Look, I appreciate what you're
           trying to do. I really do. But I
           think it's dangerous to start
           throwing out false hope like this.
           I have to put my foot down. My wife
           is not...mentally well at the
           moment, and I have to keep at least
           one of her feet here in the real
           world.
                         
                          RENAI
           You never believed me...
                         
                          JOSH
           Honey, I'm on your side. But I
           genuinely think this is dangerous
           and frankly, a little exploitative.
                         
          He turns to Elise, Specs and Tucker.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You come into a home with a
           seriously ill child, you make a
           tenuous connection between him and
           these experiences Renai is having
           and viola - the client starts
           crying because they're desperate to
           believe, the tears validate your
           power, thank you, that'll be six
           hundred dollars please.
                         
                          SPECS
           We reject more cases than we take.
           We're not out for money, sir.
                         
                          JOSH
           I know, I know...look, I appreciate
           your interest and your time. I do.
           Thank you. Thank you very much.
                         
          He goes to the front door, opening it.
                         
                          ELISE
           I completely understand. And I
           honestly don't blame you for
           reacting like this.
                         
          She walks to the door, followed by Specs and Tucker, who
          sling their bags over their shoulders sheepishly.
                         
                          RENAI
           No, please...don't go.
           65.
                         
                         
                          ELISE
           Thank you for your time.
                         
          They exit. The door closes. They are gone.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai lies in bed, awake...a broken shell of her former self.
          A bottle of anti-depressants sits on the bedside table.
                         
          Josh enters the bedroom. Sits down beside her.
                         
                          JOSH
           Look at me for a second, honey.
                          (BEAT)
           Look at me.
                         
          She doesn't look up.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Did you really believe what she
           said? In your heart of hearts, did
           you actually take what she was
           saying literally?
                         
          A long beat of silence passes.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't know...
                         
                          JOSH
           Do you think I don't want to
           believe in that stuff? Of course I
           do. It would make life a lot easier
           if I did. If I believed that some
           supernatural force was responsible
           for what's happened to our son...
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't believe anything anymore,
           Josh. I used to. I used to believe
           that I could keep my children safe.
           I used to believe everything would
           be okay. To believe in something,
           you have to know it to be true.
                         
          She turns and looks at him.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           The things that have happened to me
           haven't confirmed any beliefs -
           they've done the opposite. They've
           made me question what I believe.
                          (MORE)
           66.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           They've made me realize that maybe
           we don't know as much as we think
           we do.
                         
          Josh paces, at his wits end.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           You ask me if I believe what she
           said to be true and the answer is I
           don't know. But let me ask you this
           - in your heart of hearts, can you
           say for certain that it isn't?
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Josh lies beside Renai, who is sleeping. He is wide awake,
          staring at the ceiling.
                         
          He gets out of bed.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The door opens.
                         
          All is mute as Josh enters, skulking carefully through the
          darkness.
                         
          The curtains lull in the slightest of breezes.
                         
          Josh stands over Dalton.
                         
          He stares down at his sons body, then lets his gaze drift
          around the room...past the CLOSET, past the DRAWINGS pinned
          to the wall and the TOYBOX...all the way to the CORNER of the
          ceiling that Elise was so frightened of. Josh's eyes drill
          into the shadows.
                         
          Is there something waiting there?
                         
          Finally, Josh sits down beside Dalton. He grips his sons hand.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where are you? Where did you go?
                          (BEAT)
           Can you hear me? I'm begging you to
           show me that you can hear me...I
           don't know how to help you. Please
           tell me what to do.
                         
          Josh's torment fills the air...but Dalton doesn't move.
           67.
                         
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Please God, please help me...give
           me my son back. I will do anything
           just to have him back.
                         
          Josh studies Dalton's face for a response. Nothing. Not a
          twitch. He collapses forward onto Dalton. Holding him tight.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I need him back. I need him to show
           me that he can hear me. Please...
                         
          For a moment, all we can hear is Josh's breathing.
                         
          Then...something happens. Something Josh doesn't see.
                         
          Dalton's face twitches. It is a very slight movement. This
          movement is followed by something that is hard to miss--
                         
          One of the tacks pinning one of Dalton's drawings to the wall
          begins to wind loose.
                         
          It pops free, shooting across the room like a kernel of
          popcorn...followed by another tack.
                         
          The second tack lands in Josh's lap. Puzzled, he picks it up,
          examining it. He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on
          the wall.
                         
          With total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks
          works themselves free, popping out of the wall.
                         
          The drawing floats down to the ground.
                         
          Josh stoops down, picking it up.
                         
          It is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a
          self portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from
          above.
                         
          The right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars
          and bloated planets.
                         
          Dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side,
          flying above the house with another man.
                         
          At the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last
          night I watched myself sleep'.
                         
          A tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and
          painful tears he has long pent up.
                         
          Beneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.'
           68.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
                         
          Renai's eyes flutter open. She glances over. No one is there.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
                         
          Renai shuffles into the kitchen.
                         
          Josh is sitting at the kitchen table, staring at Dalton's
          drawing. He hasn't slept and looks it. He looks up at her.
                         
                          JOSH
           Okay.
                         
          Renai approaches Josh and they hug...holding on for dear life.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The Lambert house is lit from within. Like a Jack-O-Lantern.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Action stations.
                         
          Tucker sets up two stills camera's around Dalton's room,
          zipping back and forth between the two tripods. Specs opens
          up a kit, taking out his notepad and a pencil.
                         
          A small, circular table has been set up, adjacent to Dalton's
          bed. Elise sits at the table, flanked on either side by Josh
          and Renai.
                         
                          ELISE
           What's most important is that you
           realize no two attempts are the
           same. I will be completely honest
           with you about the results, and if
           no dialogue is established, I will
           tell you. I am not in the business
           of embellishing success. What
           happens, happens.
                         
          Josh and Renai nod grimly, truly out of their depth.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Forget the limits and laws and logic
           of this world. We are treading in a
           different place now.
                         
          Tucker finally sets his cameras and takes a seat in the corner,
          holding up a HAND-HELD VIDEO CAMERA.
           69.
                         
                         
                          TUCKER
           These still cameras are rigged to
           pick up changes in the atmosphere,
           electrical or temperature-wise. Don't
           be alarmed if they go off.
                         
                          ELISE
           Everything I say while I am in tune
           will be at a very low volume, so
           you won't hear any of it. Steven
           will write it down and repeat it
           for you.
                         
          Specs waits obediently at her side.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Hold on to each other, and stay
           focused. You'll see things you
           don't understand. Confusing things.
           Do not question them or speak in
           any way.
                         
          She turns to Specs.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Dim the lights please.
                         
          Tucker reaches up and dims the lights to a very low level.
                         
          Elise closes her eyes, concentrating. She relaxes her head,
          as if meditating, letting it loll on her shoulders.
                         
          One of the cameras on the tripod goes off, bathing the room
          in white light for a split second.
                         
          Elise inhales and exhales deeply, slipping away. Soon, she is
          very still.
                         
          Specs nods to Tucker silently, then produces an odd looking
          device made from GREY CLOTH.
                         
          It almost resembles a gas mask from World War 1, with a cone
          shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose. The snout of
          the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk, coiling
          outwards and ending in an old listening device, like an early
          version of a microphone.
                         
          Specs slips two hooks over Elise's ears and gently places the
          device over her nose and mouth. He then takes a seat next to
          her, behind Renai, who holds Elise's hand.
                         
          Specs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus
          around his neck that holds a flashlight in place.
           70.
                         
                         
          He flicks it on, then holds the microphone end of Elise's
          facemask up to his ear, a pencil gripped in the other hand.
                         
          Dead silence descends over the group like a blanket.
                         
          Then, we hear something lilt through the old microphone. It
          is Elise's muttered whispers. Specs begins writing.
                         
          Renai opens her eyes to peek at what he is scribbling in
          cursive.
                         
          we are calling out to you dalton
          Renai grips Josh's hand tightly.
                         
                          SPECS
           We are calling out to you Dalton.

                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           Tell us that you are safe. Tell us
           where you are.
                         
          For what seems like an eternity, all is quiet and still...
                         
          ...until Elise's eyelids flutter.
                         
          Another unintelligible whisper drifts out of the microphone
          at Specs' ear. He writes.
           who's there?
                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           Who's there?

           It is your mother and father. We
           have been looking for you.
                         
          Long pause. Specs writes again, more intense this time.
                         
          i need help i can't see in here
                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           I need help...I can't see in here.

           to us.
                         
          Another long pause. A little too long.
                         
          Why aren't you talking anymore dalton?
                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           Why aren't you talking anymore
           Dalton?
                         
          A long beat. Tucker's camera flash goes off again.
                         
          if they hear me they'll hurt me
                          SPECS (CONT'D)

                          SPECS (CONT'D)

                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           The man with fire on his face.

                          SPECS (CONT'D)

           72.
                         
                         
                          SPECS (CONT'D)

          come and get mepleasecomeandgetmecome
          Elise's head TWITCHES as Specs' writes furiously, trying to
          keep up. His pencil finally SNAPS. He snatches up another.
                         
           dalton are you there? dalton?
          An agonizing ocean of silence...then this furious scrawl:
                         
          listen to me you filthy whore he isnt here
          you should not have come here you fucking
          bitch i will rip your cunt apart and eat the
          fucking innards that spill forth from it i
                         HAVESEENYOUIKNOWWHOYOUAREBUTYOUANDTHE
          Specs writing begins to SHRED the paper as he writes
          furiously, the scrawl getting out of control. Sweat flies
          from his forehead as he struggles to get it all down.
                         
          Suddenly a PIERCING SCREAM blasts through the microphone and
          he jerks it away from his ear - then looks over at Elise.
                         
          With UTTER DREAD, he sees that she is NO LONGER WEARING THE
          MASK. She has taken it off and is panting heavily.
                         
          The scream continues through the mic, audible to
          everyone...then peters out.
                         
          Shocked silence follows.
                         
          Josh glances over at Dalton's bed.
                         
          He is not in it.
           73.
                         
                         
          Stunned, Josh turns back to the table--
                         
          --TO SEE DALTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM. STARING AT HIM.
                         
          His heart leaps out of his skin and so does Renai's as they
          both turn towards Dalton. Their son.
                         
          Dalton stares at them...not a trace of emotion on his face.
                         
          Then he reaches up and grips his bottom jaw with both hands,
          wrenching it downwards with almighty force and BREAKING HIS
          OWN JAW.
                         
          Renai SCREAMS into the abyss as Dalton BELLOWS at them, spit
          flying from his throat, his tongue hanging down over his
          dislocated jaw.
                         
          He stamps his foot and the table - and everyone sitting at
          it, Renai, Josh and Elise - go flying backwards as if pushed
          by a hurricane, smashing into the wall with crushing power.
                         
          We realize that Dalton was not sitting at the table, but
          squatting down awkwardly. Painfully.
                         
          He stands up, then steps forward. As Josh and Renai watch,
          his KNEE begins to BEND BACKWARDS, the tendons stretching and
          snapping, the knee bending in the opposite direction.
                         
          His other knee follows and he steps forward - both knees
          bending back.
                         
          Specs is rigid in his chair, rooted to the spot, notepad
          still in hand. When he looks up at Dalton, the flashlight
          under his chin shines in Dalton's eyes.
                         
          Dalton ROARS and advances forward - SLAPPING Specs with the
          force of ten men. Specs reels backwards, hitting the wall,
          smashing his head and crumpling like paper.
                         
          Elise stands to face Dalton. The CAMERA FLASH goes off again,
          lighting the darkened room for a split second and showing
          Elise the lipstick-smeared face of a demon instead of
          Dalton's face.
                         
          Tucker SHRINKS BACK as he captures all this with the video camera.
                         
          Dalton steps forward again and Elise CHARGES at him, grabbing
          Dalton by the hair.
                         
                          ELISE
           Leave this vessel! Leave this vessel!
                         
          Dalton BELLOWS again - a howl so course and ungodly that it
          seems ripped straight from the bowels of Lucifer himself.
           74.
                         
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           LEAVE THIS VESSEL!
                         
          Dalton FLIES backwards, hitting the corner of the wall and
          then CLIMBING IT, arcing his body into the far corner of the
          ceiling like an expert contortionist.
                         
          He hisses at them as the CAMERA FLASH fires AGAIN AND AGAIN,
          showing them split second frames of the red faced CREATURE.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Leave this earthly body!
                         
          Dalton shrieks again and somehow the force of the cry knocks
          Elise down.
                         
          The room begins to shake.
                         
          Books fly.
                         
          The closet doors burst open.
                         
          With terror, Elise looks over and sees several figures
          peering out from within the closet.
                         
          Two are the women that Specs' drew. Another is a small man,
          dressed like a child.
                         
          They stare out at Elise, their eyes glinting in the dark.
                         
          Elise turns to see Josh. The camera flash STROBES repeatedly
          and gives us split-second glimpses of an OLD WOMAN, dressed
          in Victorian era garb - standing directly behind Josh.
                         
          And then, with absolute fear, Renai sees the LONG HAIRED MAN
          standing over her. He SCREAMS at her and pushes her against
          the wall, licking her. She cries out, terrified.
                         
          With the spirit world, crashing in around her, Elise pulls
          herself off the floor and yells again.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Leave his body!
                         
          Dalton suddenly SPASMS, dropping out of the corner and
          hitting the floor like a rag doll dropped off a bridge.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           The lights!
                         
          Terrified, Specs' scrambles over to the corner, flicking the
          light switch. The room is instantly flooded with light.
                         
          The room has stopped shaking. The screaming has stopped.
           75.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton!
                         
          Renai wrenches herself across the carpet and reaches Dalton's
          limp body.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Dalton! Dalton!
                         
          She listens for breathing. His chest moves. He is still
          breathing. She holds him and cries. More desperate than ever.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Tucker, Specs and Elise convene in the kitchen, slumped
          amongst the boxes for the tech gear. All are in shock.
                         
                          SPECS
           I feel like a mountain climber
           who's been waiting his whole life
           to climb Everest, and now that I'm

          Josh sits with Renai's head in his lap. She is too
          traumatized to speak. Rain dribbles down the window pane.
                         
          Josh gets up when he hears the knock at the door. Elise
          shuffles over to answer it.
                         
          She opens the door to reveal Lorraine, wet from the downpour.
                         
          Elise steps aside and Lorraine walks in, gravely sedate.

           I asked your mother to come over. I
           called her immediately after...the

           Why?
                         
          Lorraine's usual strong will has evaporated. She looks to Elise.
                         
                          ELISE
           There is something we must talk
           about. Sit down, Lorraine.
                         
          Lorraine follows orders, easing onto the sofa. Eyes down.
                         
          Thunder growls in the distance.

          hallway.
                         
          A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach.
                         
          Someone is standing in front of it.

          The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We
          follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure.
          Standing in a doorway.
                         
          Now we can make out the edges of the figure. It is an old
          woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress.
                         
          IT IS THE SAME OLD WOMAN THAT ELISE SAW.

           Then I saw her for myself.
                         
          She looks to Elise, who nods.
                         
          Hand trembling, Lorraine retrieves a packet from within her
          coat. The paper is yellowing. Faded. Soaked from the rain.
                         
          Lorraine hands the packet to Josh, who is dumbfounded.
                         
          Renai peers over Josh's shoulder, at a Polaroid of a boy,
          about nine years old, sitting on a couch. Early 70s period.
                         
          It is a Young Josh. Behind him is the BLURRED OUTLINE OF A
          FIGURE.
                         
          Josh runs his finger over the shadow. His heart rate speeds
          up. An old memory is coming back to him.

          Josh flips to the next photo - it is another faded frame of
          Josh as a youngster. This time he stands in an old kitchen.
                         
          Once again, there is a figure behind him - clearer this time,
          but still hidden in silhouette. A step closer to Josh.
                         
          Josh flips to the next picture. A BLACK AND WHITE shot of
          himself as a young boy, lying in bed.

          With dread, Josh sees the unmistakable features of an OLD
          WOMAN, crouching beside his bed. Staring at him.

          standing by a car.
                         
          Behind him, the details of the Old Woman's dress are visible.
          Her arm is extended...reaching out for Josh's neck.
                         
          Renai's hand flies to her mouth.

          Sweat pours down Josh's brow.
                         
          He lets the photographs flutter from his fingers, backing
          away. Fragments of memories rock his entire body.

          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
                         
          The lights have been dimmed. Josh sits on a single person
          lounge chair.
                         
          Elise sits opposite him.
                         
          Tucker and Specs set up around her, fixing their cameras in
          place. Renai leans forward on the couch opposite, chewing her
          nails to the quick. Lorraine is next to her.
                         
                          ELISE
           Remember who you are and why you
           are traveling. Keep one foot in
           this world.
                          (BEAT)
           Are you ready?
                         
          Josh nods. Renai hugs him and they hold onto it. She whispers
          to him, staring into his eyes.
           82.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           I want you to know something...you
           have never been less than good
           enough for me. You've always been
           perfect for me. You're my best
           friend...my soulmate. I love you so
           much.
                         
                          JOSH
           I love you too. I have since the
           first time you looked at me. I
           don't exist without you.
                         
          Elise drifts over to the piano, lifting the METRONOME from it.
                         
          She sets it down in front of Josh, freeing the weighted swing-
          arm so it moves back and forth.
                         
          TICK...TICK...TICK.
                         
                          ELISE
           Close your eyes, Josh...and relax.
           Breathe deeply. Let all life around you
           fade out into the background...until
           the only thing you can hear is the
           ticking of the metronome.
                         
          We PUSH IN on Josh, inhaling and exhaling. TICK...TICK...TICK.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Focus on a spot in the center of
           your forehead. Feel that spot
           getting further away as you drift
           off to sleep.
                         
          We are now in an ECU of Josh. TICK...TICK...TICK.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           I want you to relax your physical
           body and let the astral body gain
           strength...feel it rising out of
           your chest.
                         
          Renai watches, literally and figuratively on the edge of her
          seat. Tucker and Specs take notes from the corner.
                         
          Josh breathes deeply. Eyes shut tightly.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Detach yourself.
                         
          Josh's eyes open suddenly and he stands up, frustrated,
          marching across the living room.
           83.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           This is useless...I have no idea
           what I'm doing and you just
           suddenly expect me to...
                         
          He turns around and stops dead. His words trail off.
                         
          HE IS LOOKING AT HIMSELF.
                         
          He sees his own body, sitting in the armchair, eyes closed.
          Elise is sitting opposite, with her back to the Josh who is
          now standing.
                         
          The living room is exactly as it was - only Renai, Lorraine,
          Tucker and Specs have disappeared. They are nowhere to be
          seen.
                         
          Stunned into mute shock, Josh stares at his own body in the
          armchair.
                         
          Slowly, Elise turns her head away from the Josh in the chair,
          staring eerily into the standing Josh's eyes.
                         
          She can see him.
                         
                          ELISE
                          (SOFTLY)
           Now you are free.
                          (BEAT)
           Keep your guide, and a steady
           stride...and into The Further you
           go.
                         
          She turns back to the Josh in the chair. The room seems to
          have darkened even more somehow.
                         
          Josh turns and glares into the darkness of his hallway as it
          yawns outwards, eventually swallowed by complete blackness.
                         
          He is not in another world. He is in his own house.
                         
          NOTE - The following scenes are not going to be "movie
          quiet". They will be inhumanly quiet. There will no score.
          Only sound scape. This is another world and should feel so.
                         
          Josh moves forward, gliding down the hall slowly. He looks
          down and sees that his feet are slighty raised off the
          ground.
                         
          He is floating.
                         
          He moves into the darkness of the hall...past the bedroom
          doors and closet doors.
           84.
                         
                         
          As he floats past, he scans every darkened corner for the
          slightest trace of movement.
                         
          He reaches the front door. He moves towards it and as he does
          it OPENS.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE FURTHER - NOT NIGHT OR DAY, BUT DARK
                         
          His street beckons beyond the door.
                         
          Josh floats across his lawn.
                         
          There are no people or cars on the street...it is as desolate
          as a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
                         A
                         TOTAL
                         ABSENCE
                         OF
          LIFE.
                         
          Some lights flicker from within the houses, but no movement
          or signs of human forms. Only mist.
                         
          Josh floats an inch above the road, moving down the street.
                         
          One thing to notice is that there is a total lack of horizon
          or city scape here...Josh's immediate surroundings are
          visible for about one hundred yards or so...anything beyond
          that, in any direction, fades into blackness. As if someone
          were shining a giant spotlight down on him.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Renai watches Josh. He is completely still...in a trance.
                         
          His eyelids flutter as his eyeballs probe in all directions
          underneath.
                         
                          ELISE
           He's in...
                         
                         
          EXT. THE FURTHER - NIGHT
                         
          Josh keeps moving, his fear registering, even in this world.
                         
          He looks down at his feet.
                         
          He is frustrated that he can't move any faster. He
          concentrates with fierce intensity--
                         
          --and then watches as his feet touch the ground.
           85.
                         
                         
          He is walking.
                         
          He starts to move faster, gaining control of his movement.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton?
                         
          The sound of his voice is strangely dead - as if he were
          inside a soundproof recording studio. There are no walls or
          angles for it to bounce off.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton? Where are you?
                         
          For a long time, there is nothing...
                         
          ...
                         
          ...then he sees it.
                         
          A figure...shrouded in shadow. Standing on the street corner
          with his back to Josh.
                         
          Josh moves towards the figure.
                         
          Closer. Closer.
                         
          The man abruptly turns the corner without looking back.
                         
          Josh glances around the corner. There is nobody there.
                         
          He continues down the street. He sees a little girl. Far in
          the distance, but close enough to focus on. She stands and
          stares...
                         
          ...then turns and walks away. Gone...like an apparition.
                         
          He looks to his right and sees--
                         
          --A SHADOW.
                         
          Behind a curtain in one of the windows, back lit by candle
          light. As with the others, the shadow turns away and
          disappears.
                         
          Josh walks towards the front door of the house. He reaches it
          and turns the handle.
                         
                         
          INT. HOUSE - THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A long corridor beckons. As with all of this world, it is
          dark here.
           86.
                         
                         
          Josh walks into the corridor, looking to his left and right
          into empty rooms. Living rooms and bedrooms. Devoid of life.
                         
          The colors are muted...the palate drained. Only REDS and
          BLACKS pop out. Blood and darkness.
                         
          Josh keeps moving down the corridor.
                         
          Up ahead, he sees a figure run past the top of the hall,
          ignoring Josh.
                         
          He presses forward, following the figure.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton?
                         
          He glances into an empty kitchen. Food rots on the table.
                         
          His footsteps have no sound as he continues on.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton?
                         
          He passes a door that is partly open. He pushes it wide open.
                         
                         
          INT. SMALL ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The room is small and empty. A strange room...like a stage.
                         
          A figure is sitting in the corner, facing the wall like a
          child being punished at school.
                         
          Josh steps closer, cautious. Takes another step.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where is Dalton?
                         
          He steps closer yet again.
                         
          His hand reaches out to touch the figures back...
                         
          ...his fingers are almost grazing the figures shoulder.
                         
          Soft laughter behind him. Josh glances back to look for the
          source.
                         
          When he turns back, the FIGURE IS GONE.
                         
          He wheels around, seeing the small-statured figure of the
          DWARF that Renai encountered, stepping through the door of
          the room.
           87.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh sidles back into the corridor. His pace is sluggish,
          dream-like.
                         
          Frustrated, he stops. Then turns to his left.
                         
          SOMEONE IS RIGHT THERE IN HIS FACE. A MAN.
                         
          The man is not looking at him...only standing very close. His
          neck lolls on his shoulders...around and around. He seems
          stuck on a loop. He is dressed in a fifties era suit.
                         
                          JOSH
           Do you know where Dalton is?
                         
          The man doesn't acknowledge him.
                         
                          MAN
           Why do I have to put up with you?
           What a tramp. You call this a home?
           I work all day for this?
                         
          He marches away, leaving Josh standing alone.
                         
          Josh keeps going, whirling around. He reaches a set of stairs.
          The stairs descend into darkness.
                         
          Josh squints into the dark, afraid.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton? Where are you?
                         
          The low rumble of this place is the only reply. Josh turns to
          walk away. A distant voice stops him.
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad...
                         
          Josh SNAPS back.
                         
          The voice drifted from out of the darkness at the bottom of
          the stairs.
                         
          Josh scurries down the creaky ramp towards it.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The core of a rotten apple. The bowels of hell.
                         
          Drenched in shadow, Josh fumbles forward into yet another
          corridor of this labyrinth.
           88.
                         
                         
          He realizes he knows where he is. He is in his OLD HOUSE. An
          alternate world version of it.
                         
          The lighting is different - it's darker. There are no signs
          of life. Water drips somewhere.
                         
          Josh stumbles forward, seeing an open door.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh slinks into a darkened and dilapidated living room.
                         
          There are THREE PEOPLE in here - a middle aged woman, a middle
          aged man and a young girl. They are all FROZEN, standing in
          place as if someone had hit the pause button on their life.
                         
          The woman is in the middle of ironing. The man is sitting in an
          arm chair reading a newspaper. The girl is lying on the floor.
                         
          The whole scene looks like a macabre `Leave It To Beaver'
          tableau - a cheerful family frozen in time.
                         
          Josh steps closer to the mother...
                         
          ...hairs prickling up on his neck when he sees her BLINK. Her
          body moves slightly. She is not frozen - merely playing
          statues. Like a street performer keeping as still as possible.
                         
          Josh turns to the father. He is the same. His hand shakes,
          struggling to hold the newspaper in place.
                         
          He backs away from them, truly creeped out. His back hits a
          window and he turns, peering through the glass down at the
          street below.
                         
          A figure, hidden in silhouette, is gazing up at him.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh stalks into a kitchen off the living room. A weathered
          door is adjacent to the kitchen.
                         
          The door is ajar.
                         
          Through it, Josh can see somebodies leg.
                         
          Josh approaches the door, prodding it open gently with his
          finger.
                         
          It is a bedroom. A tattered cot sits against the wall. A
          YOUNG MAN (17) sits on the cot, holding a rifle. Like the
          others, he is trying to be completely still, as if on pause.
           89.
                         
                         
          He is having more trouble than the family, trembling
          slightly.
                         
                          JOSH
           I'm looking for my son, Dalton.
                         
          The boy does not look up. Does not move.
                         
          Josh retreats, scanning the kitchen. There are soiled pots in
          the sink. Rotting food, but no bugs. Josh turns the faucet
          but no water comes forth.
                         
          When he turns back, the YOUNG MAN is gone. No longer in his
          bedroom.
                         
          Josh glances back at the living room.
                         
          The Young Man is now standing inside the living room.
                         
          Again, he is frozen. Holding his rifle. Looking down at his
          family, who are now splayed out on the carpet, soaked in
          BLOOD.
                         
          Each of them has a bullet hole in their head.
                         
          Repulsed, Josh tip-toes past them. He looks down at the
          mother - a bullet wound in the center of her chest.
                         
          She blinks...still playing dead.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          More corridors disappearing into darkness.
                         
          Josh wrenches his hair in frustration. He boils over,
          screaming at the top of his lungs.
                         
                          JOSH
           DALTON!!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!!!
                         
          His cry recedes into nothingness.
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad....
                         
          He heard that. Excited, he spins around, trying to determine
          where it came from.
                         
          As he does, he sees that the entire dead family is now
          gathered at the door to the living room. Watching him.
                         
          He summons all his strength and starts running, backing away
          from them.
           90.
                         
                         
          He drives himself to move faster and faster.
                         
                          JOSH
           DALTON!
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad...help me...
                         
                          JOSH
           DALTON!!
                         
          A figure suddenly appears at the end of the hallway.
                         
          It is the LONG HAIRED MAN IN THE GREY JACKET. The man who
          terrorized Renai.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN
           I hear you...
                         
          He approaches.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
           I hear you, but you don't know what
           you've done.
                         
          He licks his lips.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
           There is a place that you can't go
           to and this is that place.
                         
          He is only a few yards from Josh now. He SCREAMS with awesome
          power, his spit flying.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
           YOU MADE A MISTAKE!! I'M GOING TO
           MAKE SUFFERING A FUCKING BLESSING
           FOR YOU! I'M GOING TO RIP YOU APART
           YOU CUNT!!
                         
          He CHARGES at Josh, screaming with hellfire fury.
                         
          Josh recoils, falling onto the floor, screaming.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh's body JOLTS in the chair and he makes a noise somewhere
          between a scream and a moan.
                         
                          RENAI
           What's happening to him?!
                         
          Elise leans in, attempting to communicate with Josh.
           91.
                         
                         
                          ELISE
           You're stronger then they are,
           Josh. You are a living soul!
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh struggles. The Long Haired Man attacks him viciously.
                         
          Then something changes in Josh - he gets angry.
                         
                          JOSH
           Get...off..me!
                         
          He shoves the Long Haired Man back, pounding into him with
          the strength of TEN MEN.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Get away from me! Leave now!
                         
          Frightened, the Long Haired Man retreats, backing away until
          he is swallowed up by the blackness.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton!!
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
                          (STILL DISTANT)
           I'm here...
                         
          Josh follows the voice to another stairwell in this Escher-
          like maze of passageways.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton!
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Here...
                         
                         
          INT. BALLROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          From darkness into baroque extravagance.
                         
          Josh finds himself in a gilded chamber of long neglected
          opulence...as if a palace had been stormed, the occupants
          murdered and the place left to rot.
                         
          Mold caked pillars support a ceiling of gold flakes, the rest
          having rotted way.
                         
          Mirrors line the walls, their surface too clouded to see into.
           92.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton...?
                         
          He weaves between pillars, finally coming across a figure,
          slumped on the floor in the corner like a dog.
                         
          It is Dalton.
                         
          Josh runs to him. His foot is chained to a PIPE behind him,
          the clamp binding his right ankle. He looks pale and sick. He
          looks like one of them.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I'm taking you back.
                         
          He sees that Dalton is terrified. Looking over Josh's
          shoulder.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           What is it?
                         
          He glances back, spotting an open door at the end of the
          ballroom, light spilling from within it.
                         
          There is somebody inside.
                         
                         
          INT. MAKE-UP ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A grotesque form sits in front of an immense gold-rimmed
          mirror at a baroque powder table.
                         
          It is the RED-FACED creature seen by Elise.
                         
          The creature daubs RED LIPSTICK onto its face, arching
          forward, glaring into the mirror, caking the make-up on.
                         
          The room is littered with hundreds of discarded CHILDREN'S
          TOYS - teddy bears, stuffed animals, dolls (including one
          white-faced, black-haired doll we recognize). They are
          scattered about like bones, collecting dust in the shadows.
                         
          Suddenly the creature stops what it is doing. It sees
          something in the mirror.
                         
          What it sees is Josh.
                         
                         
          INT. BALLROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          With horror, Josh watches as the Red-Faced Man stands up and
          staggers to the door, peering through the crack at him.
                         
          Josh wrestles to free Dalton's leg from the chain. No good.
           93.
                         
                         
          Behind them the Red Faced Man opens the door. A rage unknown
          to humans is building up inside the creature. He hisses.
                         
                          DALTON
           Help me, dad...take this off me...
                         
          The creature steps closer. Taking his time. Drool seeping
          from his mouth with each drunken, wayward lope.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're not really here. You're
           asleep in your bed in our home.
           Just stand up.
                         
                          DALTON
           He's going to hurt me again...
                         
                          JOSH
           This isn't real. You can do this.
                         
                          DALTON
           He's coming!
                         
                          JOSH
           Just stand up!
                         
          Dalton does - and suddenly finds that the chain is no longer
          attached to his foot.
                         
          The Red Faced Man ROARS and the power of his breath sends
          them FLYING BACK.
                         
                          RED-FACED MAN
           This...issssss....real!
                         
          Josh smashes his head on a pillar, blood leaking from his
          head. The power of this demon far outweighs the others.
                         
           RED-FACED MAN (CONT'D)
           That...issss...my....boy!
                         
          Josh scrambles to his feet and snatches up Dalton, carrying
          him to the door as the Red Faced Man pursues.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh convulses in the chair, choking.
                         
                          RENAI
           Help him!
           94.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh surges down a corridor, carrying Dalton.
                         
          The Red-Faced Man hobbles up behind them, his rasping wheeze
          growing in volume.
                         
                          RED-FACED MAN
           You're here now! With ussss!
                         
          Josh stampedes through the front door of the house - but
          instead of the street, he is facing another corridor.
                         
          They spill into the second corridor, running again, racing
          past rows and rows of doors.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh twitches in his chair, sweat beading on his forehead.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (MOANING)
           ....ome....onnnnn...
                         
          Elise paces in front of him.
                         
                          ELISE
           They've made contact. I know it.
           He's found your son.
                         
                          RENAI
           What happens now?
                         
                          ELISE
           We need them to come back. We need
           him to find us.
                         
          Tucker's equipment begins to shake on the table. The hanging
          light above them quivers as if an earthquake were rattling it.
                         
          A force is building in the room.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          As Josh and Dalton streak down the corridor, each door opens
          and a different figure staggers out.
                         
          Grotesque figures...the solemn dead. Pale skin, hollow eyes.
          Their dead eyes drill into Josh's soul.
                         
          They want what he has - life.
           95.
                         
                         
          They begin running - chasing Josh. Dozens of them.
                         
          Josh stops, seeing that the corridor seemingly has NO END. He
          yells in frustration.
                         
                          JOSH
           I want to get out!
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh's body SHUDDERS, the cry escaping his lips.
                         
                          JOSH
           ....eeeeet out!
                         
          The room trembles again. Elise looks to Renai.
                         
                          ELISE
           Call out to him!
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh whips around, desperate.
                         
                          DALTON
           Listen!
                         
          Josh follows the order - and hears it. A faint shout. A siren
          call from another world.
                         
           RENAI (V.O.)
                          (DISTANT)
           Josh, follow my voice...
                         
          The voice seems to come from behind the door in front of
          Josh. He shoves it open--
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Renai glares at Josh's eyelids...as if he can see her through
          them.
                         
                          RENAI
           Follow my voice. Come back to us.
                         
          The room stops trembling. All is very still.
                         
          For a moment, it is as if time has stopped. Nuclear silence.
          Then...a drawer slides open in the corner of the room.
                         
          Lorraine and Renai gasp at this supernatural interruption.
           96.
                         
                         
          Specs clambers to his feet, approaching the drawer. It
          contains a note pad and nothing else.
                         
          He reaches out to close it...and then JOLTS as a HAND reaches
          out from within it!
                         
          He FLAILS backwards in fright, watching as the hand wrenches
          a mop of hair into view.
                         
          A FULL GROWN BODY BEGINS TO CLAW its way out of the drawer!
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          Drawers in Dalton's room slide open in unison. Then cabinets.
          The closet BURSTS open.
                         
          Pale adult bodies begin to claw their way out of the
          different doors, undulating out of impossibly small spaces
          and falling onto the floor like limbless insects.
                         
          Cracks are opening in our world and the miserable dead are
          slithering through the fissures.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          More doors shoot open - cabinets, closets, the pantry. Forced
          by unseen hands.
                         
          More hideous forms wrench themselves out into our world.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh is exhausted, pushing himself to the limits.
                         
          He hears the voice again - distant and small. An echo.
                         
           RENAI (V.O.)
           Find us...
                         
          Josh follows the voice to a door.
                         
          He staggers towards it, still supporting Dalton. He slams the
          door open, falling through it into--
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT, LAMBERT HOME, THE FURTHER
                         
          -- the empty basement.
                         
          He is in the basement of his old house. The wooden steps
          beckon above him.
           97.
                         
                         
          Renai's voice cries out from behind the door at the top of
          the stairs.
                         
           RENAI (V.O.)
           Hurry! Come back to us!
                         
                          DALTON
           Put me down, I can run!
                         
          Josh sets Dalton down, who scampers up the stairs. Josh is
          about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar face.
                         
          THE OLD WOMAN.
                         
          She leers at Josh through the window of the basement, her
          visage spookily flecked in candlelight.
                         
          Josh is transfixed.
                         
                          DALTON (CONT'D)
           Come on, dad! Come on!
                         
                          JOSH
           Go! I'm right behind you!
                         
          Dalton charges ahead as Josh glares back at this face from
          his past.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You...what do you want from me?
                         
          The old woman's eerily unblinking gaze cuts through Josh. A
          long dormant rage BOILS OVER inside him. He approaches the
          window, vomiting fury at her.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Get the fuck away from me! I'm not
           scared of you, just leave me alone!
           Get away from me!
                         
          The old woman's lips protract to unveil a yellow graveyard of
          molars. A smile to buckle the steeliest nerve.
                         
          She raises a lit candle to her lips.
                         
          She snuffs out the plume with a single puff...plunging the
          basement into darkness.

          We are now locked into a POV shot, pushing down the corridor
          of the Lambert's NEW HOUSE. The scene of the trance.
                         
          Our POV is bee-lining for Dalton's bedroom.

          The Red-Faced Man appears at the opposite end of the hall.
          Malevolent. Cruel.
                         
          He SCREAMS and flits towards us.
                         
          The POV keeps going, hitting the bedroom door and FLINGING IT
          OPEN - seeing DALTON'S BODY sleeping inside.
                         
          We SOAR towards it, getting closer--

          Specs stands over Dalton's body.
                         
          SUDDENLY - Dalton shudders, his legs spasm. His eyes FLICK
          open and he SUCKS IN A HUGE BREATH.

          Dalton sits up, panting. Renai charges into the room. He
          looks at her, registering her appearance.

          Renai literally throws herself at him, wrapping her arms
          around his body. No words can express.
                         
          Renai scoops him up, carrying him out of the bedroom.

          Elise leans into Josh's face.
                         
          The living room is now filled with the CREEPING FORMS of the
          souls who crawled out from within the drawers. All of them
          marching towards Josh.

          almost touching Josh--

          Josh's eyes BURST OPEN and he inhales a chest full of air, as
          if emerging from deep water.
                         
          He falls forward, his strength gone.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh? Josh?
                         
          He pants on the floor, barely able to speak.

          Dalton and Renai pounce on him.
                         
          Josh holds onto Dalton like he's a life preserver, and in a
          way, for Josh, he is. He laughs, inhaling deeply.
           100.
                         
                         
          Specs, Elise and Tucker approach. Renai sees them and stands
          up, tearful. She is lost for words.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't know what to say...
                         
          She rushes forward and hugs all three of them.

           Well put.
                         
          Josh brings Lorraine in they all embrace in a circle. A group
          hug for the ages.
                         
                          JOSH
           Now this is worth dying for.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          It's over.
                         
          Specs and Tucker haul a large tripod case to their van,
          heaving it into the back.
                         
          They stand in awkward silence. It's been a long day.
                         
                          TUCKER
           I guess you did some pretty awesome
           stuff in there. You deserve some
           credit.
                         
                          SPECS
           You did good too in an assistant-
           type way.
                         
          Tucker can't hold his stoic pose any longer. He breaks out
          laughing, followed quickly by Specs.
                         
                          TUCKER
           Thanks, boss.
                         
          They shake hands.
                         
                          TUCKER (CONT'D)
           Dude, I got some amazing shots. We
           are gonna write a book and my shots
           are gonna be the main selling point.
                         
                          SPECS
           Yeah.
                          (BEAT)
           Not the main selling point, but
           definitely important, for sure.
           101.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai lie with Dalton on her bed.
                         
                          DALTON
           I'm tired.
                         
                          RENAI
           Too bad. I'm never letting you go
           to sleep again.
                         
          She runs her fingers through his hair.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Did you know we'd come and find you?
                         
          Dalton nods.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Whenever you're lost...we'll always
           come and find you.
                         
          They hug.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Josh wanders out of the kitchen, examining the house as if
          seeing it for the first time. He is smiling...happier than we
          have ever seen him.
                         
          Elise sits on the couch amongst the remains of Tucker's
          paraphernalia of the paranormal. Josh approaches her,
          standing over her.
                         
                          JOSH
           You introduced me to a new world.
                         
                          ELISE
           No. You've been there before,
           remember? And you'll go back.
                          (BEAT)
           All of us will...eventually.
                         
                          JOSH
           Maybe I can forget again.
                         
          He reaches into his jacket, taking out the eerie photos
          Lorraine gave him of himself as a child.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I'll start by giving these back.
           102.
                         
                         
          As he hands them to Elise, she sees with fear that his hand
          is withered and wrinkled.
                         
          Like the hand of an eighty year old woman.
                         
          Shocked, she looks up at his face.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?
                         
          Elise stands. She looks haunted. Her eyes wide and unnerved.
                         
                          ELISE
           Nothing, I...
                         
          She turns away, reaching for something.
                         
                          JOSH
           What's the matter, Elise?
                         
          She spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face,
          aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo
          of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light.
                         
          Josh recoils back in shock. Elise lowers the camera. She is
          terrified. Josh suddenly LUNGES at her, slapping the camera
          out of her hands.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Why the fuck would you do that? Why
           would you do that? Why?!
                         
          He SLAMS her against the wall, his hands around her throat.
                         
          Elise chokes in terror, terrified of him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You of all people! You know! Why
           would you do that to me when you
           know what you know? You bitch!
                         
          He abruptly stops attacking her, staggering backwards,
          examining his hands as if he can't believe what he's done.
          Seething with fury. Panting.
                         
          Elise collapses, catching her breath.
                         
          Josh swipes a framed photo off the wall and storms away,
          heading down the corridor...
                         
          ...swallowed up by the darkness.
           103.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          Renai furrows her brow.
                         
                          RENAI
           What was that?
           (beat; to Dalton)
           Stay here.
                         
          She gets up.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai jogs into the living room. Sees Elise lying on the
          floor.
                         
                          RENAI
           Elise, what was that noise?
                         
          Elise simply looks up at her. The utter terror on her face is
          palpable. Her neck is bleeding from scratch marks.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Jesus...what happened to you?
                         
          Elise just stares, unable to speak. Her fear is contagious.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Where's Josh?
                          (BEAT)
           Josh? Josh?!
                         
          She turns and runs into the corridor, flicking on the lights.
                         
          There is nobody there.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai dashes from room to room in the hallway, pitching each
          door open.
                         
          Each room is empty. Josh is nowhere to be found.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          Elise stares at Tucker's camera in a state of catatonic dread.
                         
          Renai backs into the room, her own fear rising in her gut.
          She leans down and grabs Elise by the shoulders.
           104.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Elise, what happened? You're
           scaring me, tell me where Josh is?
                         
          Elise finally looks up at her. Seeing the "expert" so afraid
          unnerves Renai. When the lion-tamer drops his whip and runs,
          you know the lion is vicious.
                         
          Elise opens her mouth to speak...but nothing comes out.
                         
          Instead, she simply holds up the camera, showing Renai the
          digital display of the photo she took.
                         
          We do not see it.
                         
          We simply see the look of horror on Renai's face.
                         
                          FLASHCUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
                         
          We have returned to the previous scene - only now we are
          seeing it through Elise's eyes.
                         
          Elise is sitting on the couch, alone. Trying to recover from
          the nights events.
                         
          She glances up when Josh approaches her.
                         
                          JOSH
           You introduced me to a new world.
                         
                          ELISE
           No. You've been there before,
           remember? And you'll go back.
                          (BEAT)
           All of us will...eventually.
                         
                          JOSH
           Maybe I can forget again.
                         
          Once again, we see him reach into his jacket, taking out the
          photos Lorraine gave him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I'll start by giving these back.
                         
          As he hands them to Elise, she sees with fear that his hand
          is withered and wrinkled.
                         
          Shocked, she looks up at his face.
           105.
                         
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?
                         
          Elise stands up, not knowing how to react.
                         
                          ELISE
           Nothing, I...
                         
          She turns away, reaching for something. We see her scoop up
          Tucker's digital camera.
                         
                          JOSH
           What's the matter, Elise?
                         
          She spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face,
          aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo
          of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light.
                         
          --and in that split second, Josh is replaced by the Old
          Woman!
                         
          Elise lowers the camera, horrified. For a beat, the Old Woman
          just glares at her...
                         
          ...then she CHARGES at Elise, arms outstretched, wrapping her
          white hands around the soft flesh of Elise's throat.
                         
          Elise CHOKES, eyes bulging, spittle flying from her mouth, as
          the pale hands of the Old Woman dig into her thorax, droplets
          of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger-
          nails have CUT IN to the flesh.
                         
          The Old Woman smiles - a merciless harlequin grin that mocks
          Elise's pain.
                         
          She lets Elise go, letting her drop to the floor.
                         
          The Old Woman turns and glares down the corridor. Something
          has caught her attention. A distant scream.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The door groans open, a blade of light penetrating pitch
          black darkness.
                         
          The silhouette of the Old Woman floats ethereally into the
          bathroom. She steps up to the mirror, then reaches into her
          tattered Victorian dress and produces a candle.
                         
          She lights the candle with a match, holding it beneath her
          chin and glaring into the reflective surface of the mirror.
           106.
                         
                         
          Instead of seeing her own reflection though, she sees THROUGH
          the mirror as if it were a window.
                         
          In it, she can see the BASEMENT of the Lambert's previous
          residence.
                         
          Josh bursts into the basement, carrying Dalton.
                         
                          DALTON
           Put me down, I can run!
                         
          Josh sets Dalton down, who scampers up the stairs.
                         
          We are watching the same scene we saw earlier play out in the
          mirror.
                         
          Josh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar
          face. He looks at the Old Woman...seeing her through the
          `window'.
                         
                          DALTON (CONT'D)
           Come on, dad! Come on!
                         
                          JOSH
           Go! I'm right behind you!
                         
          Dalton disappears as Josh glares at the woman.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You...what do you want from me?
                         
          He approaches the mirror. WE CIRCLE AROUND the Old Woman,
          past the mirror and THROUGH THE BATHROOM WALL, emerging on
          the other side in--
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT, LAMBERT HOME, INSIDE THE FURTHER
                         
          --the basement.
                         
          Josh screams at the Old Woman as she stares at him through
          what he thinks is a window. THEY HAVE SWAPPED PLACES. He is
          now in The Further, and she is in our world.
                         
                          JOSH
           Get away the fuck away from me. I'm
           not scared of you, just leave me
           alone! Get away from me!
                         
          We KEEP CIRCLING, wiping past Josh's back and completing a
          360 degree turn, THROUGH THE WALL and back into--
           107.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --our world.
                         
          The Old Woman smiles at Josh's rage. She finds it amusing.
                         
          With an eerily unblinking gaze, she snuffs out the plume of
          flame with a single puff of breath...plunging the bathroom
          into darkness...
                         
          ...and snuffing out Josh forever...
                         
                         
                         
          ...and ever.

Rain. Lashing a windowpane. A PIANO PLAYS somewhere off
          screen. Beethoven's Fur Elise.
                         
                         
          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          A little boy gazes out into the storm. Nervous, eager, sweet.
          Meet GEORGE DENBROUGH (9).
                         
                                              GEORGE
                     You sure it's not too bad out
                     there?
                         
          Will (13), his older brother,   sits up in bed propped against
          a pile of pillows, surrounded   by tissues and sheets of
          newspaper. HEADLINES and TOYS   tell us this is the late 80's --
          October, 1987 to be exact. He   puts finishing touches on
                         
          A PAPER BOAT
                         
                                              WILL
                     Don't be such a wuss. I'd come if I
                     weren't dying. Now get the
                     paraffin.
                         
                                              GEORGE
                     In the cellar?
                         
                                              WILL
                     You want it to float or not,
                     Georgie? Go on. Storm's not gonna
                     last forever.
                         
                                              GEORGE
                     Okay, Willy.
                         
          George jumps up obediently and goes.
                         
                                                                             CUT TO:

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          George hurries downstairs. He catches a glimpse of their
          mother, SHARON DENBROUGH (30s) in the parlor playing piano,
          an earthy beauty transported to another world while she
          plays.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - WILL'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          George's stomach sinks as he comes face to face with THE
          CELLAR DOOR -- the only thing between George and the monster
          in the basement of his imagination -- IT.
                         
                         
          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A WALKIE-TALKIE SQUAWKS next to Will. The sarcastic walkie-
          talkie filtered voice of RICHIE "TRASHMOUTH" TOZIER (12), his
          neighbor, filters through the plastic speaker.
                         
                                              RICHIE
                                       (WALKIE-TALKIE FILTERED)
                    Willy-boy.
                         
          Will, annoyed, picks up the walkie-talkie.   While looking
          through his rain blasted window.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Trashmouth.
                         
          They wave at each other. Richie, bug-eyed glasses, turns the
          wave into a middle-finger.
                         
                              RICHIE (O.S.)
                    Thought you were sick.
                         
                                             WILL
                    I am.
                         
                              RICHIE (O.S.)
                    Is it mortal?
                         
                         
          INT. CELLAR DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Flinging it open, George ventures his arm into the DARK VOID.
          He gropes around and finds the LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. George
          snatches his arm back.
                                                                     3.
                         
                         
                                             GEORGE
                    Oh, balls. The power.
                         
          The dark basement glares back at him, taunting.
                         
             HERE WE DO SOME SORT OF CALL FROM WILL UPSTAIRS THAT IS A
          "CODE" THEY DO WITH EACH OTHER. THIS WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT
          US LATER.   
                         
                         
          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
             GEORGIE RESPONDS WITH HIS OWN CALL FROM DOWNSTAIRS   
                         
                              RICHIE (O.S.)
                    What was that?
                         
          Will coughs hard into a tissue. Half-impatient, half-joking:
                         
                                             WILL
                    Nothing. Georgie and I are making
                    a paper boat. Got to go-
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Wait-!
                         
          Will turns off the walkie-talkie.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - WILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          George rubs the gooseflesh on his arms.
                         
                                             GEORGE
                                       (TO HIMSELF)
                    I'm getting it. I'm going to get
                    it. I'm going in. I'm...
                         
          He steels himself and plunges into the void.
                         
                         
          INT. CELLAR - WILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          George scrambles down four steps to THE CELLAR SHELF and
          sifts through junk as fast as he can: SHOE-POLISH, RAGS, a
          dusty bag of colored BALLOONS, a broken FLASHLIGHT, two
          mostly empty bottles of WINDEX, and an old can of TURTLE WAX.
                         
          George stops and gazes upon the CARTOON TURTLE with hypnotic
          wonder. CUT TO POV of something lurking in recesses of the
          basement, watching GEORGE framed in the light of the doorway.
                                                                     4.
                         
                         
          Sensing this, George snaps out of it, grabs the BOX OF
          PARAFFIN near the back of the shelf, and hurries back up the
          stairs, slamming the door in our/It's face.
                         
                         
          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Will melts a chunk of paraffin with a match in a ceramic
          bowl, then dips his finger into the hot liquid and smears the
          wax along the sides of the boat.
                         
                                             GEORGE
                    Can I do some?
                         
                                             WILL
                    Okay. Just don't get any on my
                    blankets or Mom'll freak.
                         
          George dips his finger and spreads it.
                         
                                               GEORGE
                    Too cool.
                         
          They finish up and Will gives the boat to George.
                         
                                             WILL
                    There you go. She's all yours.
                         
                                               GEORGE
                    She?
                         
                                             WILL
                    You're the Captain, ain't   ya?
                    Captains call their boats   she. Now
                    put on your rain stuff or   you'll
                    wind up stuck in bed like   your
                    stupid brother.
                         
          They both grin, the cozy room full of cheerful brotherly
          love. George kisses Will on the cheek, startling him.
                         
                                             GEORGE
                    Thanks, Willy.
                         
          He goes. Will looks to the rain-lashed window, piano still
          playing. He's suddenly filled with a sense of foreboding.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Be careful out there!
                                                                    5.
                         
                         
          EXT. WITCHAM STREET - DAY
                         
          A DEAD TRAFFIC LIGHT sways overhead, its dripping black
          lenses gazing back at A BOY IN A YELLOW SLICKER AND RED
          GALOSHES.
                         
          Georgie races down the street past dark houses after his
          PAPER BOAT, which sluices along a gutter swollen with rushing
          rainwater.
                         
          Rain taps on George's hood sounding to his ears like rain on
          a shed roof, a comforting almost cozy sound. The buckles of
          his galoshes make a merry jingle as he goes.
                         
          The boat whistles past a blockade of sawhorses marked DEPT OF
          DERRY PUBLIC WORKS, where a gouge in the blacktop sends it
          sweeping diagonally across toward a STORM DRAIN.
                         
          George races after, trying to grab the boat before it's
          swallowed up with all the rainwater. He SLIPS AND SPILLS to
          the blacktop, crying out in pain.
                         
          The PAPER BOAT surfs up to the drain, circles around twice,
          and goes in. George look ready to cry.
                         
                                             GEORGE
                    Willy's gonna kill me.
                         
          He walks over to the drain and peers in, water falling into
          darkness. A dank hollow sound comes from within. Suddenly
                         
          EYES PEER BACK AT HIM -- from THE GREASY WHITE FACE OF A
          CLOWN. Not Bozo, or Ronald McDonald, but something more old
          world, freakish, like that of a 19th-century acrobat -- bald,
          lithe, almost child-like. Meet PENNYWISE aka BOB GRAY.
                         
          George recoils back, shocked by Pennywise's presence. A
          VOICE, a perfectly pleasant and reasonable voice, rises up.
                         
                              PENNYWISE (O.C.)
                    Hello, Georgie.
                         
          George looks around him.
                         
          An OLD WOMAN watches him from the kitchen window of a house
          just behind the drain.
                         
          CUT TO: POV from the OLD WOMAN's house. She turns her
          attention back to her cat, scraping out the wet innards of a
          can of tuna into a plate on the window sill.

          George expression mellows from fear to child-like wonder,
          like he's seeing a circus bear balanced on a ball .

                    Me? Why the storm of course. Just
                    bleeeew me away. It blew the whole
                    circus away. How'd you like to join
                    the circus, Georgie?
                         
          The faint, off-key sound of CALLIOPE MUSIC can be heard.
          George inches closer to the storm drain.

                    Cotton candy? Oh yes. Cotton candy
                    and bearded women and elephant shit
                    and all the balloons a little boy
                    could want. You like balloons,
                    don't you Georgie?
                         
                                             GEORGE
                    I sure do. Do they float?
                         
          George takes one last fatal step forward.
                         
                                             PENNYWISE
                    Float? Oh indeed they do, Georgie.
                    Indeed they do. Everything down
                    here floats. And when you're down
                    here with us...
                         
          The clown's sing-songy voice curdles into something horrible,
          primal even, as George's arm is seized by Pennywise's
          unusually LONG arm and CLAW-like hand.

          CUT TO the OLD WOMAN's POV again. The cat devours its food,

          RACK FOCUS... Georgie's rag doll body flung left and right as
          Pennywise feeds on him and tries to pull him through the

          PAN OFF glacier-cut mountains to reveal the TOWN OF DERRY,
          MAINE, settled on a crosscut of the Penobscot River and
          Kenduskaeg stream. It's a sturdy, picturesque Northeastern
          town like any other, its rough-hewn industrial past bleeding
          through a gentrified, decaying present.

          SEVERAL multi-acre, manure filled sheep pens stand empty.
          One has 50 sheep ready for slaughter, a path leading from the
          pen grows narrower as it feeds into an industrial complex
          designed for slaughter.

          LEROY HANLON (50s) works to move the sheep into line while
          his son MIKE HANLON (13) watches from behind him.

                    of them?
                         
          Leroy, haunted by this thought answers gruffly-

          As if he were lying, that humans sometimes ARE raised for
          food.
                         
          The sheep flood into a thinner pathway leading to the
          interior of the complex. Leroy watches them as does Mike.

                    Everyday, watching them stupidly
                    walk into that killing pen. This
                    isn't a normal kid's life. You
                    won't even let me go to school.

          Leroy takes the cattle bolt, places it on the head of the
          first sheep. WOOMPH. The sheep drops dead.
                         
                                             LEROY
                    Now why would you want to be in
                    public school with the rest of
                    those people down below, in Derry?
                         
          He hands it to Mike, expectantly. Mike dispassionately takes
          the mechanism and approaches a sheep.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    Because I want to be in boring
                    classes with other boring kids and
                    draw pictures in text books and
                    play baseball and go to dances and
                    grind.
                         
          He places it on the head of the next sheep, but can't bring
          himself to pull the trigger.
                         
          Leroy does it for him.   WOOMPH.   The sheep drops dead.
                         
                                             LEROY
                    I know, son. I get it. But you
                    aren't like those people. We may
                    work with sheep, but those people
                    are sheep. Trust me.
                         
          The last point Leroy believes in like gospel.

          injector for kids with life-threatening allergies) holstered
          in his medicine-filled fannypack; STAN URIS (12), a trim and
          tidy Jewish kid who dresses like a mini-accountant; and
          RICHIE TOZIER, the neighbor with the walkie-talkie, a comic

          PAN back to WILL and his dorky friends.   Eddie stops dead,
                         POINTING TO-
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Jesus, she's still here?
                         
          The RABBI'S WIFE, sleepless and desperate, lurks on the edge
          of school property, scanning the throngs of departing kids
          with desperate eyes. Next to her, a FRONT LAWN MARQUEE reads:
                         
                               REMEMBER THE CURFEW.
                                      7 P.M.
                             DERRY POLICE DEPARTMENT
                         
                                             STAN
                    What do you think she's thinking?
                         
                                             WILL
                    Maybe she expects her son to just
                    walk out of the school with the
                    rest of us.
                                                                  11.
                         
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Yeah right, Dorsey Coen's been
                    living in home ec these last three
                    weeks.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    They're not going to find him.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Sure they will. In a ditch. All
                    decomposed, covered in worms and
                    maggots and smelling like your
                                   MOM'S--
                         
          Richie is CHECKED TO THE PAVEMENT by TRAVIS BOWERS (16), a
          sadistic tower of muscle. His glasses fall off and a pile of
          comics and video game magazines spill from his back pack.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Sorry chode. Didn't see you.
                         
          Travis kicks the glasses away. His thug sidekicks laugh:
          SNATCH HUGGINS (15), PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER (17) and VICTOR
          CRISS (15) -- one a lunkhead oaf, another a perpetually
          giggly fire-starting sociopath, and the last one a scrap and
          scab junk yard dog type.
                         
          Victor grabs Stan's yarmulka and tosses it into the window of
          a departing bus.
                         
                                             VICTOR
                    Frisbee, fuck nut.
                         
          Snatch burps in Eddie's face. Eddie wilts under the smell.
          Will scoops up the remains of Richie's glasses, smashed by
          the bus.
                         
                                             WILL
                    You suck, Bowers!
                         
          Travis and his goons turn. They glare at Will menacingly.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    You say something?
                         
          Everyone around them stops and watches, waiting for Will to
          respond. Eddie gives Will a look to shut it. He does.
                         
                                              TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    Thought so. You got a free ride
                    this year because of your little
                    brother. But ride's over,
                    Denbrough.

                    train, for you and your faggot
                    friends.
                        (to Snatch and Victor)
                    Let's roll. We got a lard ass to
                    find.
                         
                         
          EXT. EMERGENCY EXIT - DERRY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          A door opens by the dumpsters and out peaks BEN HANSCOM (13),
          the "lard ass" in question, making sure the coast is clear.
          He wears an oversized sweatshirt and a pair of girly high-
          waisted blue jeans.
                         
                                              BEVERLY
                    Soooo, you gonna let me go by or is
                    there a secret password or
                    something?
                         
          He turns to see Beverly.
                         
                                               BEN
                    Sorry.
                         
          He steps aside. Beverly tip-toes past, lighting a cigarette
          like a pro.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    "Sorry"'s not much of a password.
                    Now "kittyhawk," that's a good one.
                         
                                               BEN

                    Barnburner.
                         
          Beverly smiles and offers Ben a smoke. He refuses. She shrugs
          and blows a smoke ring in his face.
                         
                                              BEVERLY
                    If you're worried about Bowers and
                    his merry band of a-holes hassling
                    you, don't. I saw them all leave
                    out front.
                         
                                               BEN
                    Thanks.
                                                                  13.

                    Beverly Marsh.
                         
          A little too quick. His ears turn red with embarrassment.
                         
                                             BEN (CONT'D)
                    I just know `cuz we were in social
                    studies. Together, in the same
                    class. You know, like the
                    constitution test, and stuff.
                        (realizing he's vomiting
                                        NONSENSE)
                    I'm Ben.
                         
          Bev smiles, knowingly. It's clear he likes her. Ben notices a
          FAINT YELLOW BRUISE on her forearm. Bev notices him noticing.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                        (off Ben's look)
                    I slipped in the shower. What's
                    your excuse?
                         
                                             BEN
                    I fell on three boxes of donuts.
                         
          Beverly laughs.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Well, see ya around Ben from sosh
                    class. "Get laid in the shade."

          Ben watches her go, totally smitten.

          INT. WILL DENBROUGH'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Dust collects on the piano in the living room. A stale quiet
          suffocates the house. The only sound the ticking of a clock
          and the distant yelling of playing children.
                                                                  14.

          Will Denbrough laces his shoes. As he leaves his room, he
          notices the door to George's room is open, his FATHER, ZACH
          DENBROUGH (30s), lost in thought notices him.
                         
                                             ZACH
                                       (WITHOUT EMPHASIS)
                    Hey Champ. Going out to play?
                         
                                                WILL
                    Yeah, Dad.
                         
          Will looks like he wants to say more, but doesn't have the
          words to articulate it.
                         
                         
          INT. WILL DENBROUGH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Jumping down the stairs and rounding the corner, he sees his
          catatonic Mother, silhouetted by the midday light, sitting in
          the darkness, staring blankly at the piano.
                         
                                                WILL
                    Hi, Ma.
                         
          Growing accustomed to his parent's lack of communication, he
          sifts through a PILE OF UNOPENED MAIL on the dining table and
          finds his report card. Opens it. All A's.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    I got my report card.
                         
          He holds the paper limply in his hands. She doesn't
          acknowledge him and instead gets up and slides the doors shut
          to the piano room.

          Eddie, Richie, Will, and Stan scramble in the front door like
          feral animals. An enormous 300-pound woman sits in the living
          room doing a puzzle on her own stomach. SONIA KASPBRAK (40s).

          They raid the kitchen, stuffing Capri Suns, Ding Dongs,
          whatever snacks they can find into their backpacks. Mrs.
          Kaspbrak calls from the room.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK
                    Eddie-bear, where are you boys off

                    too much on that grass, sweetie.

          A librarian, MRS. STARRET (50s) places a stack of books in
          front of Ben.
                         
                                MRS. STARRET
                      Isn't it summer vacation? I would
                      think you'd be ready to take a
                      break from the books.

                                MRS. STARRET
                      Well, even with all this terrible
                      disappearing of kids business, a
                      boy should be with his friends,
                      outside, having fun.

          INT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Beverly opens her fridge. There's nothing in it but a
          plastic jug of margarine, some half-molded white bread, and
          suspect milk. She sniffs the milk.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Beverly sips the milk, leaving a wholesome white mustache on
          her upper lip. She looks up to see...
                         
          Her Mother, MRS. MARSH (30s), a former prom queen long since
          faded, watching her. Studying her.
                         
                                    MRS. MARSH
                      Bev.
                         
                                               BEVERLY
                      Yeah, Mommy?
                         
          Mrs. Marsh sounds like she might be on sedatives.
                         
                                MRS. MARSH
                      You had your monthly, yet?
                         
                                               BEVERLY
                      What Mommy?
                         
                                MRS. MARSH
                      Bleeding, between your legs?
                         
          Disgusted, Beverly shrinks.
                         
                                                   BEVERLY
                      No.    Why?
                         
                                MRS. MARSH
                      Soon, soon I figure.       And then
                      you'll be a woman.
                         
          She sits down next to Beverly, grasping with her clammy palms
          Beverly's free hand.
                         
                                MRS. MARSH (CONT'D)
                      When it happens, once every 27
                      days, you'll bleed, and you'll
                      bleed the most right before the
                      end.
                                                                   18.
                         
                         
          Beverly, squeamishly tries to remove her hand from her
          mother's, but the harder she pulls away the harder the Mother
          holds onto her.
                         
                              MRS. MARSH (CONT'D)
                    I want you to go to the pharmacy
                    today. To be prepared. You'll
                    need to buy these.
                         
          Mrs. Marsh holds up a BLOODY TAMPON from a string.
                         
                         
          INT. DERRY SYNAGOGUE - DAY
                         
          The Rabbi and Stan read the TORAH. Stan is repeating and
          learning pronunciation of the words for his Bar Mitzvah.
                         
          He starts to lose attention as he looks around the ornate
          room and the beams of light fingering out from the windows.
                         
                                             RABBI
                    Are you paying attention?
                         
                                               STAN
                    Yes, sir.
                         
                                             RABBI
                    Pay attention, son. This is
                    important. This is about you
                    becoming a man.
                         
                                             STAN
                    I am. I'm taking this very
                    seriously Rabbi.
                         
          The Rabbi removes his glasses and looks at Stan.   His
          thoughts carry him away.
                         
                                             RABBI
                    Not everyone gets this opportunity,
                    Stanley.
                         
          Stanley nods.
                         
                                             RABBI (CONT'D)
                    My son, God bless him, might never
                    get a bar mitzvah. Do you realize
                    that?
                         
          The Rabbi squares up to Stanley, holding both of his
          shoulders.
                                                                   19.
                         
                         
                                             RABBI (CONT'D)
                    We may never see him again, he may
                    be dead now. And death is forever,
                    Stanley, you don't come back from
                    death.
                         
          Stanley nods as the Rabbi starts to tear up. He pulls
          Stanley in close to him, as if Stanley were his own long lost
          son. Stanley, pressed against the Rabbi can hardly breath.
                         
                                             STAN
                    Rabbi, I need to go pee.
                         
          The Rabbi cries.
                         
                                             STAN (CONT'D)
                    Rabbi, can I go pee please?
                         
          The Rabbi stops, distances himself from Stan again and looks
          deep into his eyes.
                         
                                                RABBI
                    Of course.
                         
          He lets him go.
                         
                         
          INT. DERRY SYNOGOGUE, DOWNSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Stanley walks down the old, molding stone stairs to the
          basement of the synogogue. It's a rounded staircase that
          spirals into the deeper foundations of the building.
                         
          He can't find the bathroom, but he does see the Mikveh--a
          cleansing room for the women of a synogogue during their
          monthlies. It drips water and is lit by a spare light bulb.
                         
                         
          INT. SYNOGOGUE, MIKVEH - SAME
                         
          Stanley walks in, knowing no one is watching him and unzips
          his pants to relieve himself in the pool of water.
                         
          Suddenly, he notices something bubbling from below.   A NAKED
          WOMAN, her pale white skin glowing from the light.
                         
          He backs away and quickly zips up his pants.
                         
          The woman rises to the surface, exhaling a long held breath
          of air. She dries the water from her eyes and looks at
          Stanley, not at all bothered by her nakedness or Stanley's
          witnessing of it.
                                                                  20.
                         
                         
                                             NAKED WOMAN
                    You like looking at my body?
                         
                                             STAN
                    I... I.
                         
                                             NAKED WOMAN
                    It's okay, I won't tell anyone.
                         
          She looks down towards her privates, still below the water.
                         
                              NAKED WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    Do you want to see the rest of me?
                         
          Her hands slowly move towards her pussy, touching herself.
          Stanley starts to back away.
                         
                                             STAN
                    I should probably be getting back-
                         
                                             NAKED WOMAN
                    You're going to be a man soon,
                    won't you? I'll show you mine if
                    you show me yours.
                         
          She starts to get out of water.
                         
          ANGLE FROM BEHIND her as she steps out of the water, towards
          him. The naked woman's back is full of sores and bleeding,
          her butt shredded and rotten.
                         
          And as she rises from the water, we see that her legs have
          been reduced to bones and gristle.
                         
                              NAKED WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    Come here Stanley, come float with
                    me.
                         
          Stanley trips over himself back peddling. He turns around
          and jets out of the room just as the naked woman lunges.
                         
                         
          INT. DERRY SYNOGOGUE, MAIN FLOOR - SECONDS LATER
                         
          Stanley runs up and into the arms of DORSEY COEN'S MOTHER,
          breathless. He looks up at her and SCREAMS and runs out of
          the building. The Mother looks at the Rabbi, perplexed. He
          shrugs and cleans up from their study session.
                         
                         
          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY
                         
          Ben sits at a table of six by himself, flipping through books
          on DERRY'S HISTORY.
                                                                  21.
                         
                         
          INDIANS, COLONIZATION, DISAPPEARING SETTLEMENTS, LOGGING,
          MURDERS, MASSACRES, it gets more and more violent. Glancing
          up, he sees...
                         
          The one-armed old man plunk a NICKEL into a jar and take a
          STAMPED POST CARD from a tray by the door. A poster there
                         READS:
                         
                         LIBRARIES ARE FOR WRITING TOO.
                         WHY NOT WRITE A FRIEND TODAY?
                         
                         
          EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - LATER
                         
          Ben sits on the steps, POSTCARD in his lap. He clicks a pen
          open and, brow furled in concentration, dashes off a HAIKU.
                         
                                             BEN
                        (whispering it outloud)
                    Your hair is winter fire,
                                   JANUARY EMBERS
                    My heart burns there, too.
                         
                         
          EXT. CANAL STREET - LATER
                         
          Ben is about to the drop the postcard into a MAILBOX when has
          second thoughts. He holds it just over the slot. We see that
          it's addressed to: MISS BEVERLY MARSH, LOWER MAIN STREET,
          DERRY MAINE, ZONE 2. Ben closes his eyes, steels his courage
                         
          AND LETS GO.
                         
                              TRAVIS (O.C.)
                    Hello hot tits.
                         
          Travis, Snatch, Hockstettler, and Victor prowl toward him.
          Ben bolts, ass swinging back and forth like a girl. Travis
          and his gang take off after him...
                         
                         
          EXT. KANSAS STREET - CONTINUOUS
                         
          It's no contest. Ben rounds the corner and just makes THE
          KISSING BRIDGE, a historic covered wooden bridge carved with
          thousands of hearts crossing right where the canal turns into
          the wild, untamed barrens, KENDUSKAEG STREAM rushing below.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Gotcha!
                         
          They snag Ben and fling him against the railing. Travis flips
          up his sweatshirt, exposing his fat belly, and slaps it hard.
          Ben screams like a rabbit, whipsawing back and forth.
                                                                    22.
                         
                         
                                             SNATCH
                    Look at that gut!
                         
                                             VICTOR
                    Sounds like a pig. Don't he sound
                    just like a pig?
                         
          Victor SQUEALS like a pig in Ben's face.
                         
                                             BEN
                    You better quit, I swear.
                         
          Travis pulls a BUCK KNIFE from his jeans. Ben's eyes go wide.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Or what? You'll go crying to mama?
                    I'll give you something to cry
                    about.
                         
          Ben looks around for help. A CAR comes slowly down the
          street. Travis hides the knife, pressing its steel against
          Ben's white belly.
                         
                                             TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    Go ahead. Yell. You'll be picking
                    your fucking intestines off your
                    sneakers.
                         
          The OLD COUPLE behind the wheel CATCH EYES WITH BEN, see his
          tears, and STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR. Ben sees A CLOWN riding
          in the back seat, grinning -- PENNYWISE.
                         
                                             TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    Okay, tits. It's exam time. First
                    question: when I say `Let me copy'
                    during finals what do you say?
                         
                                             BEN
                    Yes! I say yes! Okay! Copy all you
                    want!
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    That's good. Now how can we make
                    sure that sticks?
                         
                                               BEN
                                   I DON'T--
                         
          In two quick motions Travis SLASHES A BRIGHT RED "T" in Ben's
          belly.
                         
          Snatch and Victor laugh.    Hockstettler pulls out his lighter
          and a can of hairspray.
                                                                     23.
                         
                         
                                               HOCKSTETTLER
                      Let me light his head on fire like
                      Michael Jackson.
                         
          Hockstettler jettisons a fireball with his make-shift flame
          thrower, just past Ben's head.
                         
                                               TRAVIS
                      No! Hold him. I'm gonna carve my
                      entire name on his cottage cheese
                      filled ass.
                         
          Ben is too shocked to scream. He looks over his shoulder at
          the stream behind him, then back at Travis's bloody blade.
                         
                                               TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                      Now say it with me. What comes
                      after T?
                         
          Ben plants his heel in Travis's chest and launches himself
          backward over the railing, out of the grip of Victor and
          Snatch. Travis is knocked back on his ass onto the pavement.
                         
                         
          EXT. KENDUSKAEG STREAM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Ben tumbles down the culvert, fetching up hard against a
          fallen tree. He picks himself up, eye to eye with
                         
          A HUB CAP
                         
                                               TRAVIS
                      Oh, you're dead, tits.
                         
          Travis comes leaping over the railing with the knife, Victor
          and Snatch right behind. Ben grabs the hub cap and HURLS IT
                         
          PELTING Travis IN THE FACE
                         
          Travis trips up, taking down Victor and Snatch with him. They
          all splash down in the stream, where Travis LOSES THE KNIFE.
                         
          Ben darts off across the water into a thicket of woods.
                         
                         THE BARRENS
                         
          Travis gropes around for his lost knife, suddenly hysterical.
                         
                                               TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                      My knife, Goddamn it! I lost my
                      daddy's knife!
                         
          Victor and Snatch help Travis search the stream, their hands
          passing right by where the BLADE IS WEDGED UNDER A LOG.
                                                                     24.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE BARRENS - DAY
                         
          Another boy's hand fishes around under water and grasps upon
          something. ON Will as he PULLS OUT A SNEAKER. Behind him...
                         
          RICHIE and STAN throw branches, rocks, whatever into the
          middle of the stream trying to DAM IT UP.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    C'mon Eds get your ass down here
                    and help.
                         
          EDDIE paces the embankment with their shoes and socks and
          backpacks. He looks anxious.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    No way. There's sixty million
                    diseases in that stream. It's gray
                    water.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    What's gray water?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Tell `em Will. Your dad works for
                    the public works.
                         
          Will is studying the sneaker.
                         
                                             WILL
                    It's like where all the wash water
                    and storm drain runoff goes.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Sewer water. Pee and poop. I'm
                    telling you guys you're splashing
                    around in Derry's toilet.
                         
          Richie and Eddie shrug and continue building their dam.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Smells alright to me.
                         
                                     WILL                              EDDIE
          Guys?                             Seriously. I don't know why
                                            we're down here. There's
                                            poison ivy and mosquitos and
                                            God knows what else could get
                                            us sick. Not to mention we're
                                            all alone down here. What if
                                            we run into that psycho who's
                                            been picking off kids.
                                                                     25.
                         
                         
                                     WILL                            RICHIE
          Guys--                          I overheard my mom talking to
                                          my aunt in Bangor. She says
                                          it's a sex fiend. Some
                                          drifter. But no one from
                                          Derry. Couldn't be.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Guys! Shut up!
                         
          They all shut up and turn to Will.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Whatcha got there Willy boy?
                         
          Will comes sloshing up. He flips Richie the sneaker.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Look inside.
                         
          Richie does. "DORSEY COEN" is written in black marker.
                         
                                                RICHIE
                    Son of a--
                         
          Richie tosses it to Stan who drops it like a hot potato.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Stan, you idiot.
                         
                                                STAN
                    Sorry.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    What's the big deal? It's just a
                    sneaker.
                         
          Will has to fish it back out of the water.
                         
                                             WILL
                    It's Dorsey Coen's sneaker.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Shit. This isn't good, guys. This
                    seriously isn't good. We should go.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    How do you think Dorsey feels?
                    Running around these woods with
                    only one friggin' shoe.
                         
                                             WILL
                    If he's still running.
                                                                  26.
                         
                         
                                             STAN
                    What if... he's still around here?
                         
          They all lock eyes. Will and Richie come to a decision. They
          pick up sticks and start sloshing down stream where the shoe
          was found. Stan stays frozen.
                         
                                               WILL
                    Dorsey!
                         
                                               RICHIE
                    Dorsey!
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Guys-- Guys stop. We're gonna get
                    in trouble.
                         
                                               RICHIE
                    For what?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    I don't know. Disturbing evidence.
                    Contaminating a scene. We should
                    just mark where we found the shoe
                    and leave an anonymous note to
                    Chief Borton. My mom would have a
                    major cow if she knew I was playing
                    down here, I kid you not.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Shit, Eds you get within twenty
                    feet of a peanut she has a whole
                    herd. I don't want to think what
                    she'll have if you come home with
                    another kid's corpse.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    That's not funny, Richie. That's so
                    not funny. Will, please.
                         
                                             WILL
                    I'm with Richie. If I were Dorsey
                    I'd want us to look for me.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Fine. You guys can do what you want
                    but I'm going. I have no interest
                    in seeing the muddy mangled body of
                                   SOME--
                         
          He turns to see BEN STUMBLE FROM THE WOODS all bloody. Eddie
          screams and sloshes out into the stream he was so assiduously
          avoiding.
                                                                  27.
                         
                         
          They all see Ben.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Holy friggin' Moses. What happened
                    to you?
                         
          BEN COLLAPSES on the river bank. The boys rush to his side.
                         
                         
          EXT. UP-MILE HILL - DAY
                         
          Mike streaks past homes and businesses on his bike, riding
          into THE CENTER OF DOWNTOWN. He carries a package of MEAT on
          his bike.
                         
                         
          INT. COSTELLO'S MARKET - DAY
                         
          Mike makes his delivery and gets cash from MR. COSTELLO, the
          grocer.
                         
                         
          INT. DERRY SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY
                         
          Mike deposits the money and takes a free lollypop from the
          teller.
                         
                         
          EXT. DERRY SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY
                         
          Mike steps outside, throws up the kick, and pushes his bike
          out into the street. Will's crew WHOOSHES PAST on their
          bikes, Will and Eddie, and Stan and bloody Ben riding double.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Heads up, homeschool!
                         
                                             MIKE
                    Eat me, townie!
                         
                         
          EXT. KISSING BRIDGE - DAY
                         
          Travis, Snatch, Victor, and Hockstettler are still looking
          for the knife in the water under the bridge.
                         
                                             SNATCH
                    It probably got washed away,
                    Travis.
                         
          Travis grabs Victor by his collar and growls in his face.
                                                                     28.
                         
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    It ain't been washed away.     It's
                    been stolen.
                         
                                             VICTOR
                    Stolen, by who?
                         
          Travis points up the embankment at Mike, biking home over the
          bridge.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    That nigger right there.
                         
                         
          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
                         
          Mike bikes home, sucking on the lollypop, when he notices
          something coming up fast behind him.
                         
          TRAVIS and his boys in a beat up Trans Am.
                         
          He starts peddling faster. Sees the KITCHENER IRONWORKS sign
          ahead and skids right down its path towards the ghostly
          titanic ruin.
                         
                         
          EXT. FIELD - KITCHENER IRONWORKS - DAY
                         
          Mike looks around for a place to hide, a bird spooking off
          from the twisted carcass of the factory building. The
          Penobscot River flows behind.
                         
          Travis and his boys skid to a stop in the field, machinery
          blocks their pursuit by car so they jump out on foot.
                         
          Mike finds a SMOKESTACK laying in shattered sections in the
          grass. He stares into its big black bore, picks up a loose
          tile, and pitches it in. It lands with a faint echo in the
          darkness.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Travis, Snatch, Victor and Hockstettler search for Mike in
          the SKELETAL REMAINS of the old ironworks structure itself,
          an open wound of twisted iron beams.
                         
          Oblivious to any danger other than their own volatile
          potential, we get a sense that around every corner, some
          ominous figure is just ducking out of sight.
                         
          Mike clocks them from inside the smokestack, the dodges
          around the perimeter of the ironworks structure.
                                                                    29.
                         
                         
          He nears the CELLAR HOLD, a yawning chasm on the edge of the
          ruins. Sees a Derry Historical Society PLAQUE:
                         
                               ON THESE PREMISES
                          AN EXPLOSION TOOK THE LIVES
                          OF 102 SOULS (88 CHILDREN)
                             EASTER SUNDAY, 1906.
                            MAY THEY REST IN PEACE
                         
          PENNYWISE appears across the cellar hold OVER HIS SHOULDER.
          When Mike looks up from reading Pennywise IS GONE.
                         
          Mike looks back across the weedy field to THE FENCE, his bike
          still leaned against it. It seems a million miles off.
                         
                         
          EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS
                         
          Travis and the boys continue to explore the far side of the
          factory, sensing Mike may have made a run for the river.
                         
                         
          INT./EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS
                         
          Sensing an opportunity, Mike books it back to his bike.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS
                         
          Hockstettler notices something off screen.    Walks towards it.
                         
          Following Hockstettler we see what he sees: a lone BALLOON,
          as if just leaving the grasp of a child, floating up in the
          air.
                         
                                             HOCKSTETTLER
                    What the fuh...
                         
          He looks back at Travis and the others, who are sniffing out
          the weeds near the river.
                         
                         
          EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS
                         
          Mike gets to his bike and starts pushing it up the hill. He
          looks back towards the factory. Travis and his boys still
          haven't come back to their car. Mike pedals home.
                                                                     30.

          Travis, angry they didn't find Mike huffs back across the
          field, throwing a piece of scrap pipe he found against a
          giant corrugated wall. The entire factory vibrates with the
          gonging sound.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Let's go! That jungle monkey ain't
                    here no more.
                         
          Travis walks obliviously past AN EASTER EGG, smeared with
          bloody fingerprints, but Hockstettler sees it, picks it up.
                         
                                             HOCKSTETTLER
                    I'm staying.
                         
          The three of them turn towards Hockstettler like he's insane.

                    I want to see its insides.
                         
          He points towards the door leading to the dark innards of the
          factory.
                         
                                             HOCKSTETTLER (CONT'D)

                    This place gives me the creeps.
                         
                         
          EXT. KITCHENER IRONWORKS
                         
          Travis and the others load up and peel off in their car.
                         
          Hockstettler watches them leave, a cloud of dust in their
          place, then turns towards the darkest parts of the factory,
          as if pulled deeper into the core unconsciously.
                         
          ANGLE OVER CELLAR HOLD, Hockstettler peers in.   He grabs a
          handhold and sways over its cavernous depth.
                         
          HOCKSTETTLER'S POV: Nothing but darkness.
                         
          Hockstettler takes out his lighter and hairspray, launching a
          fire ball that illuminates the cavern below.
                                                                      31.
                         
                         
          Monoliths of rusted machinery, half-submerged in stagnant
          puddles of black mud.
                         
          And for an instance, a CLOWN.   Pennywise. Then blackness
          again.
                         
          Hockstettler saw IT, but doesn't believe it. He unleashes
          another fire ball. For a second we see the faces of DEAD
          CHILDREN amongst the monoliths.
                         
          Hockstettler isn't sure if he's seen right. He walks in, the
          hair rising on the back of his neck.
                         
                         
          INT. CELLAR HOLD - SAME
                         
          Hockstettler carefully maneuvers his way down into the hold.
          His feet, blindly tapping for purchase.
                         
                                             HOCKSTETTLER
                    I ain't afraid. Any you ghosts
                    down here can't hurt me.
                         
          As if it were a mantra, to make himself feel less scared.
                         
                                             HOCKSTETTLER (CONT'D)
                    I seen ghosts. I did them in their
                    butt holes.
                         
          And out of the darkness...

                    Did they float?
                         
          He freezes.   Did he hear that or was that in his head?
                         
                                              HOCKSTETTLER
                    I, I-   Who's there?
                         
          Hockstettler lights a ball of hair spray, it illuminates the
          walls near him, but nothing far away.
                         
                                             HOCKSTETTLER (CONT'D)
                    There's no one down here. There's
                    no one that can hurt me.
                         
          He moves down deeper. Lights the hair spray again, and for
          second, we think we glimpsed, deeper in the shadows,
          Pennywise.

          Now sure he's heard something, Patrick stops. His breathing
          starts to rapidly increase. He wants to back up, but he's
          frozen.
                         
          He lifts up his hair spray can, finger shaking on the plastic
          nozzle, he lifts the lighter. CLINK. The flint lights up
          the small flame. Sputtering in the flowing air in the
          cellar. His breathing is arrhythmic, compressed.
                         
                                             PENNYWISE
                    Because down here, we all float.
                         
          He sprays. The flame spits out and out of the darkness,
          PENNYWISE the clown leaps onto Hockstettler, tumbling him
          into the cellar hold, he drops the lighter and hairspray,
          which rolls down to the feet of a child. A DEAD CHILD.

          The pack of boys, Will, Richie, Ben, and Eddie come biking
          down Center Street and swing into RICHARD'S ALLEY. They jump
          off, bikes clattering to the pavement.

          Will and Eddie race in, leaving Ben and Richie in the alley
          which is emblazoned with a COLORFUL MURAL about the FBI's
          ambush of the infamous Bradley Gang, a celebrated slice of
          Derry town history.

          Ben nods, grateful for the company. He notices in the mural,
          in one of the windows, a CLOWN watches the ambush with glee.

          Annoyed, Keene comes out from behind the counter. He kneels
          next to Eddie and takes the pen, plunging it into his thigh.

                    Nothing.
                         
          He sees Ben there, looking like a train wreck.
                         
                                             STAN (CONT'D)
                    What happened to him?
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          ANGLE ON A CLOSE-UP of the "Coen shoe" placed on a desk in
          front of CHIEF BORTON and OFFICER BOWERS, Travis' hillbilly
          father. Will is alone in the room with them while--
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - MAIN BULL PEN - SAME
                         
          Ben, all bandaged up, looks on with Eddie, Richie, and Stan
          as Will speaks to the police officers.
                         
                                             BEN
                    Beverly was there?
                         
                                               EDDIE
                    Yeah.
                         
                                             BEN
                    And she stole this stuff for me?
                         
          Stanley wants Ben to shut up, but Ben is beyond excited.
                         
                                             BEN (CONT'D)
                    Did she know it was for me?
                         
                                              RICHIE
                    I don't think she even knows you're
                    alive man.
                         
                                         BEN                          STAN
          Yes she does.                   What's going on in there?
                         
                                             RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    What do you think? He's handing `em
                    the kid's shoe. It's riveting.
                         
          Ben checks his Timex, cracked but working.
                                                                   36.

                     Takes a lickin' and keeps on
                     tickin', huh?
                         
                                              BEN
                     My mom gave it to me so I wouldn't
                     be late for curfew.
                         
                                              EDDIE
                     I think he means you, Big Ben.
                         
          The boys shove him playfully.   Ben shoves back.
                         
                                              BEN
                     It's funny, `til the last week I
                     didn't think anyone knew my name.
                         
                                              RICHIE
                     You're pretty friggin' hard to
                     miss.
                         
                                              EDDIE
                     Guys, you think whoever kidnapped
                     Dorsey might of, I dunno... got
                     Georgie too?
                         
                                     RICHIE                            BEN
          If he creeps in storm drains,    Who's Georgie?
          maybe.
                         
                                              EDDIE (CONT'D)
                     Will's little brother. Or was.
                     Before your time.
                         
                                              RICHIE
                     Will won't talk about it but the
                     kid's arm got ripped clean off in a
                     flash flood or something.
                         
          Richie turns towards Stan, who's been unnaturally quiet this
          whole time.
                         
                                              RICHIE (CONT'D)
                     Cat got your tongue?
                         
                                              STAN
                     What?

          Why are you so quiet?            What's Chief Borton going to
                                           do with a shoe?
                         
                                       STAN                            BEN
          I'm not.   I'm listening.        A storm drain. Crazy.
                                                                  37.
                         
                         
          Will steps out.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Well?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    What did he say?
                         
                                             WILL
                    Nothing. Thanked me for being a
                    good young citizen.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    So let's get outta here. Police
                    stations always make me feel guilty
                    of something.
                         
                         
          EXT. OLD CAPE STREET - DAY
                         
          The five losers bike home, Will and Eddie, Stan and Ben
          riding double. Will skids up to a chain link fence by the
          rail yards. Eddie jumping off to take his usual short cut.
          They all splinter off their different ways.
                         
                                             EDDIE

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Will lays out on the carpet in front of the TV, eating ice
          cream from a carton. His parents sit on opposite ends of the
          couch like bookends, father flips through a Popular
          Mechanics. His mom stares at the TV, her mind elsewhere.
          There seems to be no connection between any of them.
                         
                                             WILL
                    I found something today.
                         
          No response. Finally his Mom stirs.
                         
                                             SHARON
                    You say something honey?
                         
                                             WILL
                    That missing Coen boy. I found a
                    clue.
                                                                     38.
                         
                         
          His parents flash looks.
                         
                                             ZACH
                    Stay out of it, Will. Let the
                    police handle these things.
                         
          They go back to watching TV. Will tries for some sort of
          connection.
                         
                                             WILL
                    What about Arcadia?
                         
          His dad stops mid flip, all the air going out of the room.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    We haven't talked about our park
                    trip at the end of the summer.
                    Usually by now we're all looking at
                    the brochure together. We have so
                    much fun there every--
                         
          Will's dad throws the magazine down.
                         
                                             ZACH
                    Enough.
                         
          He storms out to his workshop. Sharon is too upset to look
          her son in the eye.
                         
                                             WILL
                    What did I say?
                         
                                             SHARON
                    Nothing... Your father, it's just
                    too much to deal with right now.
                         
                                             WILL
                    I'll mow lawns. Paint fences.
                    Whatever.
                         
                                             SHARON
                    It's not that.
                         
          She loses it for a moment, then composes herself.
                         
                                             SHARON (CONT'D)
                    Your brother just looked forward to
                    this trip so much. That park was
                    his favorite place in the world.
                         
          She takes Will's carton and retreats into the kitchen. Will
          is left all alone, TV blaring, spoon hanging over nothing.
                                                                     39.

                    Mine too.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          A slummy apartment over Lower Main Street. A Red Sox game
          blares on from somewhere down the hall. We track down the
          hallway and PAN just as Beverly starts to unzip her pants and
          close the door.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Beverly finishes peeing. She reaches for toilet paper but
          there isn't any. She rifles through the toiletries under the
          old fashioned sink basin looking for anything she can use-
                         
                                CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Help me.
                         
          Beverly looks around for the voice, startled.
                         
                              CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Help me, Beverly.
                         
          It comes from THE SINK DRAIN, above her head.
                         
          She stands, her pants still around her ankles, leaning
          forward over the basin, looking down into the dark void.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Is s-someone there?
                         
          Nothing. BEV'S EYE PEERS DOWN THROUGH THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT.
                         
                              CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    We all want to meet you, Beverly.
                         
          She gasps, backpedaling, pulling up her pants.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Who are you?
                         
          The single voice turns into a cacophony, bubbling up through
          the ages.
                         
                              CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    I'm Matthew... I'm Dorsey... I'm
                    Veronica... I'm Georgie... Come
                    play with us down here... Come play
                    with the clown... You'll float,
                    Beverly. Oh how you'll float...
                                                                    40.
                         
                         
          Terrified, Beverly dashes out.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Bev finds HER FATHER (40s) asleep in front of the TV, still
          in his janitor's uniform from Derry Home Hospital. His
          toolbelt is thrown up on the coffee table.
                         
          She tip-toes over and steals the TAPE MEASURER.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Beverly stands over the sink basin, tape measurer in hand.
          The voice is silent.
                         
          She unfurls the tape into the drain, its tip disappearing
          into the void.
                         
          FOOT BY FOOT she snakes the tape into the drain, until it's
          fully extended at 20 feet. She waits for a voice. Nothing.
                         
          Slowly, she begins to reel the tape back in, counting down
          the length as it winds back in. 16 feet... 15 feet... 14
          feet... AT 13 FEET VISCOUS BLOOD COATS THE TAPE.
                         
          BEVERLY GASPS and drops the measurer. It goes clattering into
          the sink, the tape coiling up like a snake, blood flickering
          everywhere as she stumbles back, tripping into the shower.
                         
          BLOOD GOUTS UP FROM THE SINK DRAIN
                         
          Like a demonic ejaculation -- blood splatters the mirror, the
          wallpaper, bouncing off walls and covering Beverly. She
          SCREAMS and runs out the door...
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          ...into her father, who comes charging up the hall. She
          screams again, recoiling away.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    What the devil's gotten into you,
                    girl?
                         
                                              BEVERLY
                    The bathroom! Daddy, in the
                                   BATHROOM--
                         
          His arm shoots out and GRABS HER WRIST LIKE A VICE.
                                                                  41.
                         
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    Someone peeking at you, Bevvie?
                    Huh?
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    No... the sink... in the sink...
                         
          He stalks past, dragging her behind him. They step into...
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Mr. Marsh looks around, eyes wide, blood splattered
          everywhere, but the blood doesn't register with him.
                         
          He shoves her against the wall. Hard.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    You know I hate gettin' rough with
                    you. I never do when you don't
                    deserve it.
                         
          He points back to the gory sink.
                         
                              MR. MARSH (CONT'D)
                    What's my tape measurer doin' outta
                    my toolbelt?
                         
          He steps over and grabs the BLOOD-COATED TAPE, clipping it
          onto his belt, blood on his hands now too. He doesn't seem
          to see any of it. Only Beverly can. She realizes this.
                         
                              MR. MARSH (CONT'D)
                    Answer me girl.
                         
          He raises his hand.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    The sink... I was... I thought I
                    saw a spider...
                         
          Uncertain whether he'll hit her anyway, she closes her eyes
          and prepares for a smacking.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                                       (SMILING)
                    A spider?
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Yes, sir. I'm sorry for waking you.
                         
          He lowers his hand, gentle now, proprietary.
                                                                    42.
                         
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    I worry about you, Bevvie. I worry
                    a lot.
                         
          Smoothing out her hair over her forehead. The blood on her
          face like finger paint. This is when he scares her the most.
                         
                              MR. MARSH (CONT'D)
                    You know why I don't drink or smoke
                    or chase after women like other
                    fathers do?
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Because you love momma?
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    Not just her, Bevvie. You. You're
                    almost a woman now, too. And I got
                    me all I need right here at home.
                         
          He rests his forehead against hers, breathes in her scent,
          goes back down the hall to his game.
                         
                         
          INT. DETAIL ON CEILING - NIGHT
                         
          ANGLE ON a wet, dark spot as it grows on a white plaster
          ceiling, the first droplet of water forming. SLOW MOTION as
          it breaks away and falls through space...
                         
                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

          ...onto Will's head. He doesn't stir. But then it is
          followed by SEVERAL OTHERS. Finally, he awakes. Looks up.
                         
          A leak in the ceiling.
                         
          Will flips back his covers.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Will grabs a bucket from a utility closet and, walking back,
          sees Georgie's room's door open...
                         
                         
          INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Will enters, the room frozen in time. GEORGIE'S TOY BOX is
          open. Photographs and posters line the walls.
                                                                     43.
                         
                         
          STAR WARS bedsheets crisp and military tight on the bed.    A
          Lego Turtle on the night stand. Will picks it up.
                         
          Will sits down, Turtle in hand, and indulges in the sadness
          that has engulfed his home for months. The loss of his
          brother hitting him full force, he closes his eyes to fight
          back the tears, but cannot.
                         
          He cries for George. Photographs of George, illuminated by
          passing cars, seem to watch him from the walls.
                         
          A SHADOW seems to stretch across Georgie's room from the
          doorway.
                         
          Will looks up but no one is there.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Will steps out of George's room and finds DARK FOOTPRINTS IN
          THE CARPET. He leans down and touches one -- squishy and
          wet. They track down the dark staircase.
                         
          Will, heart pounding, follows the wet footprints down the
          stairs, careful not to step in any of them.
                         
                                              WILL
                    Hello?   Dad?
                         
                         
          INT. DOWNSTAIRS - WILL'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          At the bottom of the stairs Will finds the footprints lead
          TOWARD THE KITCHEN WHERE...
                         
                                              WILL
                    Ma?
                         
          Will sees a YELLOW FLASH of something ducking around the
          corner. Startled, Will drops the Lego turtle, which smashes
          into pieces and scatters across the wood floor...
                         
             WILL HEARS GEORGIE'S "CODE" CALL FROM THE OPENING SCENE.
          IT COMES FROM THE KITCHEN   
                         
          Will looks back up the stairs half-expecting his parents to
          wake up. Nothing but an eerie silence. He gathers his courage
          and follows the wet footprints into...
                                                                   44.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - WILL'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Will steps in, face to face with THE CELLAR DOOR, the door
          creaking closed, light snapped on behind it, footprints
          disappearing down into the cellar.
                         
                                             WILL
                                       (VOICE QUIVERING)
                    Georgie?
                         
             WILL RESPONDS WITH HIS OWN "CODE" CALL. THERE IS NO
                         IMMEDIATE RESPONSE   
                         
          Will slowly approaches the door and reaches out for the
          handle, but stops with second thoughts. He starts backing
          away, too spooked to go down, when he hears...
                         
          A CHILD WEEPING BEYOND THE DOOR, then...
                         
             GEORGIE'S "CODE" CALL, COMING FROM THE BASEMENT   
                         
                         
          INT. CELLAR - WILL'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Will opens the door, rickety stairs leading down into
          darkness, the weeper somewhere in the recesses, along with
          the steady sound of a LEAK.
                         
          Steeling himself, Will descends. He gets to the last few
          rungs and is thrown off for a moment seeing HIS REFLECTION in
          the basement floor, as if it were A BLACK MIRROR. He realizes
                         
          THE CELLAR HAS FLOODED
                         
          Will looks up toward the leak/weeping sound and sees, curled
          in the same corner where we had that opening POV...
                         
          GEORGE IN HIS YELLOW SLICKER.
                         
          Rain rolling off him like he's still in a storm flooding the
          cellar. He looks up at Will.
                         
                                             GEORGE
                    Why'd you make me go, Willy?
                         
                                              WILL
                    Georgie?
                         
          Will moves to step into the water when he hesitates, holding
          his foot over it. He looks to Georgie whose expression of
          distress seems insincere.
                         
                                             GEORGE
                    Help me, Willy.
                                                                     45.
                         
                         
          Will grabs a rake from the wall and pokes its tip into the
          water. It's a good six inches deep.
                         
                                             GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    You'll float.
                         
          Water and muck pour from his mouth as he says these last
          words, an endless cascade.
                         
          Will recoils. Georgie glides over the water towards Will, and
          we realize there is a creature beyond it, the colors of a
          clown's costume, PENNYWISE, propping up Georgie's body like a
          MEAT PUPPET.
                         
          Horrified, Will races up the stairs as...
                         
          PENNYWISE crosses the flooded basement and scuffles up the
          steps after Will, arms and legs splayed out like a charging
          crocodile, Georgie's limp corpse strapped to his back.
                         
          Will slams the door on Pennywise's/Georgie's gross face.
                         
                         
          INT. WILL DENBROUGH'S HOUSE, WILL'S ROOM
                         
          Will slams the door of his room and hides in his bed.
          Panting. The DOOR KNOB starts to rattle.
                         
          Drip. Will looks up. The leak from the ceiling getting
          worse. The DOOR KNOB rattles even more. Shaking until it
          seems like its going to fall off.
                         
          Silence. Will approaches the door. He grabs a baseball bat
          and prepares to attack. Swinging open the door, ready to
          swing... it's his FATHER.
                         
                                             ZACH
                    Will.
                         
          Seeing the bat.
                         
                                             ZACH (CONT'D)
                    Easy! What's wrong? What's all
                    the noise about?
                         
          Will exhales, safety.
                         
                                             WILL
                    There's a leak in my ceiling. Then
                    I went to check the cellar and its
                                   FLOODED AND--
                         
          Zack looks at Will's ceiling.
                                                                     46.
                         
                         
                                             ZACH
                    Where's the leak, son?
                         
          Will points at it but nothing registers for Zach.
                         
                         
          INT. WILL'S HOUSE, BASEMENT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Will and Zach stand over the stairwell. Zach turns the light
          on and walks down, much to Will's horror, into a puddle of
          water.
                         
                                             ZACH
                    Dry as a bone, Will.   Sure it
                    wasn't just a dream?
                         
          Will holds himself, too freaked out to speak.
                         
                         
          EXT. EDGE OF THE BARRENS - MORNING
                         
          Will, Stan, Richie, Ben and Eddie stand at the edge of a
          police cordon. Beyond, CHIEF BORTON and A LINE OF POLICE
          OFFICERS, SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES and VOLUNTEERS sweep the woods
          with blood hounds.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    But we got a project we're working
                    on out there.
                         
                                             CHIEF BORTON
                    Barren's will be off limits for
                    now, kids. Go on into town and
                    play there.
                         
          They all look on in disappointment.   Then pick up their bikes
          and head back into town.
                         
          A dog picks up a scent near A MORLOCK HOLE -- a cement
          cylinder that sticks about four feet out of the ground with a
          vented iron manhole cover stamped: DERRY SEWER DEPARTMENT. A
          drone comes from somewhere deep within.
                         
          Officer Butch Bowers arrives with news for Chief Borton.
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    We've got another one, Chief.
                         
                                             CHIEF BORTON
                    Another what?
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    Kid gone missing.
                                                                     47.
                         
                         
                                                CHIEF BORTON
                    Dear Lord.     Who is it?
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    One of my son's friends. Patrick
                    Hockstettler.
                         
          PAN OVER to reveal Travis, waiting meekly inside Officer
          Bowers' squad car.
                         
                                             CHIEF BORTON
                    The family notified you directly?
                         
          Officer Bowers nods for Travis to approach.
                         
                                              OFFICER BOWERS
                    Then I did a little investigating
                    of my own.
                                       (TO TRAVIS)
                    Tell him what you told me, boy.
                         
          Travis doesn't know where to start.
                         
                              OFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D)
                    Tell him, damn it! Tell him who
                    you last saw him with.
                        (he turns to Chief Borton)
                    The negro boy from outside of town.
                    The ones who run the abatoir.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - MORNING
                         
          BEN'S HAIKU is propped on a night stand.
                         
          Beverly stirs awake. Her sheets and pillows are smeared with
          blood. Her face crusted with dried gore.
                         
          Groggy, and nearly sleep walking, she sits up and walks out
          without taking stock.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S BATHROOM - MORNING
                         
          Bev opens the door, wiping her eyes she approximates the
          sink, bends over to wash her face and eyes. With the first
          crust of blood removed from her eyelids, she looks into the
          mirror and let's out a choked, exhaling GASP of horror.
                         
          Surrounded by brown and crusty wallpaper, is Beverly's
          realization that the blood was not a dream.
                         
          Beverly's Mom appears in the doorway.   Beverly turns to her,
          speechless, in shock.
                                                                     48.
                         
                         
                              MRS. MARSH
                    Darling, sometimes I look at myself
                    in the morning and think the same
                    thing.
                         
          Beverly tiptoes out of the horror scene. She shyly looks at
          her mother as she dries her hair over a blood-drenched sink,
          oblivious to it all.
                         
                              MRS. MARSH (CONT'D)
                    Look at these roots.
                         
          Beverly is speechless.
                         
                         
          INT. HANDLON ABATTOIR - DAY
                         
          Puddles of BLOOD seem to lap like small waves towards us.
          PAN UP to reveal Mike and Leroy sweeping the blood and water
          out of the slaughtering pen.
                         
          Officer Bowers followed by SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS enter the
          facility.
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    Leroy Hanlon?
                         
          Leroy turns and notices the officers for the first time.
                         
                              OFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D)
                    We need to bring in your boy for
                    questioning.
                         
                                                LEROY
                    For what?
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    Police business.
                         
          Mike turns to his father, frightened, shaking his head.
                         
                                             LEROY
                    We need a lawyer?
                         
          He looks at Mike, searching for any indication what this
          could be about. Travis appears in the distance and Mike
          instantly knows.
                         
                                                MIKE
                    Dad, it's-
                         
          Officer Bowers roughly grabs Mike by the neck and starts to
          lead him out.
                                                                     49.
                         
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    Let's go, boy.
                         
                                              LEROY
                    Hey!   No need for that.
                         
          He grabs Officer Bowers by the arm. Bowers quickly and
          excessively puts Leroy in a wrist lock and throttles him
          against the killing pen fence. Leroy moans in pain.
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    Search this place, now. It's the
                    perfect place to hide a body if you
                    ever needed to.
                         
          Officer Bowers looks around in disgust.   Travis smiles from
          the safety of distance and local power.
                         
                                             LEROY
                    This ain't right! You need a
                    warrant, you can't just-
                         
          Leroy seizes his arm, then his chest, then crumples to the
          ground, losing consciousness in the puddle of blood.
                         
                                              MIKE
                    Dad!
                         
          Mike tries to rush for him but he is forcefully escorted to a
          waiting police car. Other Officers look to Bowers for
          direction. Officer Bowers turns Leroy over.
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    Call an ambulance.
                         
                         
          EXT. BEN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          ALL of the boys have gathered in Ben's room. An aimless
          summer morning with nothing to do. They play with his junk
          and are generally turning his room over. Will examines a
          pair of walkie-talkies not unlike his own.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Whoa, what's with the history
                    project, Benny-boy?
                         
          Richie notices that Ben's walls are covered in xerox copies
          and historical drawings, all relating to Derry's history.
                                                                  50.
                         
                         
                                             BEN
                    Oh, uh, when I first moved here I
                    didn't have anyone to play with or
                    anything, so I just started hanging
                    out in the Library.
                         
          All of the boys turn and look at Ben.   Seriously?
                         
                                     RICHIE                          EDDIE

          Stan takes a closer look.
                         
                                             STAN
                    Why is it all, like, people getting
                    killed and missing kids and stuff?

                    I don't know. There's just a lot
                    of that here. Been that way since
                    the original settlers.
                         
          Will, who was more interested in a Viewmaster, turns and
          looks at the walls now. Sees a copy of an old-timey document
          with 300 signatures. INCORPORATION OF THE TOWNSHIP OF DERRY.

                    You have a copy of the Town

                    Derry started as a logging camp
                    before it was officially on any
                    maps. 300 people signed the
                    charter that made Derry Derry. A
                    month later they all disappeared,
                    without a trace.

          Eddie is freaked out by this revelation.

          attention to Ben.

                       The only clue was a well house that
                       was burnt down to charcoal.

          Ben points out on an old map that has a translucent modern

          Richie slaps Eddie in the back of the head. His fierce eyes
          castigating Eddie for not thinking before speaking, Eddie
          confused, "wha-?"

          Will, Richie, Eddie, Stan, and Ben, stripped to their tightie-
          whities (except Ben who still has a T-shirt), stand in a line
          staring at the edge of a rocky outcropping in a quarry turned
          pond. The black water of the pond foreboding, endless.

                    your chest, I'm not sure if getting

                    shit. You make it seem like any
                    water we get in is like swimming in
                    an out-house.

                    Too late.
                         
          The boys turn around to see Bev in a one piece summer dress.
          She pulls off the dress quickly, down to her underwear,
          sprints off the edge and jumps into the water. BOOM.
          Cannonball.
                         
          The boys, not wanting to be showed up by the girl take one
          last look at each other and jump in. SPLASH! SPLASH! SPLASH!
          SPLASH! SPLASH!
                         
          All except for Eddie, who crawls down the rock outcropping
          and stares at the screaming and laughing kids enviously.
                                                                     53.

                    don't you get in you pussy?
                         
          Eddie dips the toes of one of his feet in.   Flabbergasted,
          Richie gives up on motivating Eddie.
                         
          Richie dives under the water and swims beneath the kicking
          legs of all his friends, a shark's P.O.V. He doesn't see...
                         
          PENNYWISE floating in from the depths beneath him.
                         
          On the surface Ben yelps, something yanking his leg. Richie
          surfaces.
                         
                                             BEN
                    Very funny, Richie.

                    I thought so.
                         
          Something yanks Richie's leg too. Hard. He and Ben wait for
          whoever it was to surface from the inky water.
                         
          Ben sees Will, Bev, and Stan swimming back toward Eddie on
          the edge of the quarry. They scream and laugh and swim their
          asses back to land.
                         
                         
          EXT. BASSEY PARK QUARRY, SHORE - LATER
                         
          The SIX of them now sunbathe on the rocks at the edge of the
          pond. Their eyes are closed, soaking in the vitamin D,
          except Ben, who can't take his off of Beverly's tanning body.
                         
          Will sits up and looks out at the water. It is so black it
          seems other worldly. Not breaking his stare from the water,
          he addresses the group.
                         
                                              WILL

                    something wrong with Derry. Like
                    it's, I don't know, haunted or

          Ben, happy to have something else to focus on other than
          Beverly, looks at Will.

          Stan opens his eyes and joins in.
                         
                                             STAN

                    vibes with all this chitter
                    chatter.
                         
          Beverly, eyes still closed, places a cigarette in her mouth
          and lights up. Ben notices her hands shake as she holds the
          cigarette in her mouth. The smoke swirls and dissipates over
          them.
                         
                                             BEVERLY

          Will whips his neck to Beverly. He can't tell if she is
          making fun or if she is seriously asking him for a bridge.
                         
                                             WILL
                    I... If I tell you guys something
                    you won't think I'm crazy.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    We already know you're crazy, Will.
                    No judgement here.

                    I saw Georgie last night.   Only.
                    It wasn't him.
                         
                                              EDDIE

                    No. In my house, he tried to get
                    me to go into the basement with
                    him.
                                                                  55.

                    neighborhood sex offender making a
                    house call.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Shut up Richie. It wasn't just
                    him. I saw this other... I don't
                    know.
                         
                                             STAN
                    What did you see Will?
                         
                                                BEN
                    The clown?
                         
          Will, Stan and Eddie look at Ben.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Yes. That's what it was, a scary
                    looking clown. And it had these
                    teeth...
                         
                                             STAN
                    I saw something, too. In the
                    basement of the synogogue.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    I take it back. I'm judging all of
                    you and you are all friggin'
                    wackos.
                         
          Beverly, still laying there, exhales a long trail of smoke.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    I need to show you guys something.
                         
                         
          EXT. LOWER MAIN STREET - DAY
                         
          The FIVE boys and Beverly stand outside her slummy apartment
          building. She looks frightened to go inside.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    My Daddy will kill me if he finds
                    out I had boys in our apartment.
                         
                                             BEN
                    Isn't he at work?
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Sometimes he comes home for a nap.
                                                                  56.
                         
                         
                                               WILL
                      We should leave lookouts. Ben,
                      Stan, can you?
                         
          Ben is ready to protest. Then succumbs, crestfallen.
                         
                                               STAN
                      What does he look like?
                         
                                                 BEVERLY
                      My Daddy?    Mean. Like a drunk.
                         
          Will, Richie and Eddie go with Bev.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Bev opens the door. It creeks open. The apartment seems to
          be empty. Afternoon sunlight illuminating floating dust
          motes. She scouts around and lets them in.
                         
          Will, Richie, and Eddie follow her to a closed door at the
          end of the hallway -- THE BATHROOM DOOR
                         
                                                 BEVERLY
                      In there.
                         
                                               RICHIE
                      Can you give me an indicator of
                      what I'm about to walk into?
                         
                                               BEVERLY
                      You'll see.
                         
                                               RICHIE
                      I hope it's Ed McMahon and I've
                      just won publishers clearing house
                      10 million dollar sweepstakes. But
                      if it is, you really didn't have to
                      go through so much trouble, you
                      could have just brought Ed to the
                      quarry.
                         
          She has no intention of going in. Will pushes past Richie and
          opens the door.
                         
                                               EDDIE
                      Oh God. Oh God.
                         
                         THE BLOOD
                         
          Still there, faded into maroon clouds on the mirror and
          wallpaper. Richie reels back into the hallway with Beverly.
                                                                   57.
                         
                         
          She looks from Richie to Will.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    You really see it?
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    It's like someone slaughtered a pig
                    in here. Or a parent.
                         
          Richie is slack jawed.
                         
                                             WILL
                    What happened?
                         
          Bev is so relieved she almost cries.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    The sink. It came out from the
                    sink. My parents couldn't see it.
                    I thought I was going crazy.
                         
          Will goes to Eddie, who still stands frozen in terror.
                         
                                             WILL
                    You okay, Eddie? Eddie Kaspbrack?
                         
          Eddie snaps to it, suddenly more composed, resolute even.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    Ed. Go outside. Get Ben and send
                    him in here.
                         
          Eddie just nods and walks out the door.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    You see it, don't you, Richie?
                         
          Richie nods.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    We can't leave it like this.    Let's
                    clean it up.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          Will, Richie, Ben and Bev clean like grim elves, using a
          bucket of hot water, ajax, and some cloth rags. Slowly the
          blood washes out. Reaching for the same rag, Will and Bev's
          hands touch, a spark between them.
                                                                    58.

          Stan and Eddie stand lookout on a curb below.
                         
                                             STAN
                    What's taking them so long?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    There was a lot of blood.
                         
          Eddie shakes his head. Something disturbing catches his
          attention.

          Will pours the last of pink bucket water down the bathtub
          drain. The bathroom now as clean as it ever was. The bucket
          is filled with blood stained rags.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    All I'm saying is maybe there's
                    some weirdo going around Derry
                    dressed as a clown. You know, like
                    the Joker in a "Dark Knight" comic.
                    Some whack job who likes to dress
                    up and kidnap kids.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Okay, so how did he put Georgie in
                    my basement?
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Or blood in my sink?
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    I don't know. Who knows how crazy
                    people do things, right?
                         
          Pebbles hit the window. Richie goes over, sees Eddie and Stan
          jumping up and down. The sound of footsteps come up the
          hallway. They look at each other, who's the extra footsteps?
                         
                         
          INT. STAIRS TO BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Mr. Marsh fumbles with his keys outside the door.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          They race through the apartment to a window that opens to
          fire escape into the alley. Bev throws it open and Will, Ben,
          Bev, and Richie climb through.
                                                                   59.

                    I am now.    Thanks to you guys.
                         
          The window slams shut behind them just as Mr. Marsh enters
          the hallway.
                         
          He sees a bloody rag on the counter and picks it up, wiping
          his sweaty face, smearing blood all over it.
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION, CHIEF BORTON'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Chief Borton and Officer Bowers hand Mike's mom a copy of
          Mike's signed statement. He nearly has to defend himself
          from her anger.
                         
                    CHIEF BORTON                     MIKE'S MOM
          Ma'am. Ma'am.                     His father is in the hospital
             (BEAT)                         in critical condition and
          Ma'am!                            you, you're supposed to be
                                            protecting the children!
                         
                                             CHIEF BORTON
                    Ma'am. We were just doing our job,
                    but he's free to go home with you,
                    now.
                         
                                             MIKE'S MOM
                    He damn well better be.
                         
          Officer Bowers leans into Mike.
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    You got lucky, boy. Could have
                    been you who disappeared. Be
                    careful next time creeping around
                    old places like that.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    I told you who chased me there.
                         
          Mike nods to TRAVIS BOWERS, who is sitting, shamefully, in an
          office next door to Chief Borton's office.
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    Oh, and he will be punished, don't
                    you worry, I swear on my belt
                    buckle he will.
                         
          Officer Bowers smiles, looks at Travis, whose face reveals he
          knows he will get a whooping that night.
                                                                    60.
                         
                         
                                             MIKE'S MOM
                    C'mon, Mikey. Your father needs
                    us.
                         
          Mike turns and follows his Mom obediently out of Chief
          Borton's office.
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION, BULL PEN - SAME
                         
          On their way out, Mike and his Mom pass Will, Ben, Bev, Stan,
          Eddie and Richie scrambling in the door to the station.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    What happened, homeschool?
                         
          Mike says nothing, his eyes looking forward in anger. Will
          and the others rush toward Chief Borton's office.
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS

                    Whoa whoa. Where do you crumb
                    snatchers think you're going?

          Borton steps out.    His long day just got worse.
                         
                                             CHIEF BORTON
                    It's okay, Butch. Someone try to
                    do something to you kids?

          Not someone.    Something.        There's like this spirit.
                         
                                               BEN
                    A clown.
                         
                                             STAN

                                             EDDIE
                    Only us kids can see it.
                         
          Borton narrows his eyes at Richie, the only one silent.
                         
                                             BORTON
                    Okay, stop. Is this you Tozier?
                    Did you put them up to this little
                    practical joke.
                                                                  61.

                    Such wild imaginations. Too bad we
                    can't bottle their little brains.
                    Dry them out and grind them into
                    powder to salt our food. Maybe
                    then we'd see, what was it again?
                         
          Borton's exhausted.   He's having none of it.
                         
                                             CHIEF BORTON
                    You youngsters realize there's a
                    penalty in Derry for filing a false
                    police report. I don't want to
                    have to call your parents, now.

          The kids all look at each other, stymied.

                    anywhere. Now go home, all of you.

                    to go play like normal kids and
                    forget all about this fantasy about
                    murder and monsters. This is an
                    adult matter. You got it?

          The kids all stand there, Borton's big frame intimidating.

          CRRRRRACK! A mailbox explodes as a Trans-Am speeds off, the
          boys inside it whooping and laughing their heads off.
                         
          The car swings up to another and Travis Bowers leans out of
          the window, throwing in a SIZZLING M-80.
                         
          He shuts the lid, pulls back into the passenger seat, and
          screams to the driver, Victor.

          Victor hits it and they roar off. Snatch and MOOSE SADLER
          (16) scrunched like sardines in the backseat. They all look
          back to see...
                         
          CRRRRRACK! The mailbox explodes. The boys share a hip flask

          Travis fishes the bag full of M-80s and bottle rockets and
          they blow another mailbox.

          Mike enters, sheepish. Leroy is in bed, full of tubes to
          bleeping machines. He looks decimated. Mike's mom is on her
          way out.

          Mike nods.    She squeezes Mike's shoulder as she goes.
                         
                                                LEROY

          Leroy coughs.    His lungs are filling with fluid.
                         
                                                MIKE

                       Stop that, Mike. There's no one to
                       blame here. It's nature taking its
                       course.

          Leroy looks at his son, sadness etched in the lines of his
          sullen face.

          Leroy indicates a chair next to the bed. Mike pulls it up
          and sits next to his Dad, leaning in close.

          He coughs again. Mike can smell the creeping death coming
          from his father's insides.

          YOUNG LEROY (13) and YOUNG DICK (13) sneak up along the rail
          of the canal outside a raucous, crowded little gin joint.
          Only black folks stand in line to get in, music and reverie
          blaring from within. The two boys look at all the pretty
          girls and snazzy men with awe.

          Leroy squeezes Mike's arm, frustrated.   Harder than he
          thought he could squeeze.

          Leroy groans through his teeth.
                         
                                             LEROY (CONT'D)
                    This isn't about you, Mike. It's
                    not even about me. It's about
                    Derry. This town is like poison.
                         
          He coughs again.
                                                                  65.
                         
                         
                                                MIKE
                    Dad?
                         
                                                LEROY
                    Shut up    and listen to me. There
                    was one    night, 1960. I remember
                    because    it was August and Chubby
                    Checker    just dropped "the twist".
                         
                         
          INT. THE BLACK SPOT - NIGHT
                         
          A hot hot night, the little shack filled up to the rafters
          with people dancing, twisting, enjoying themselves. YOUNG
          LEROY and YOUNG DICK push their way through the sweaty bodies
          to a window. They find some floaters on the sill there and
          drink them up. Out the window Leroy notices...
                         
          MEN IN WHITE ROBES
                         
          Stalk from the woods and light torches.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE BLACK SPOT - NIGHT
                         
          The men in white robes -- THE MAINE LEGION OF DECENCY --
          barricade the door with a cart and light the timbers on fire.
                         
                         
          INT. THE BLACK SPOT - NIGHT
                         
          Smoke starts to take over the place. People panic, stampede
          the doors. They don't budge. Women, men are crushed against
          the hot door as people push against them to get out. Young
          Leroy among them. He's grabbed by his friend Dick who pushes
          him out the window.
                         
                         
          EXT. BLACK SPOT - NIGHT
                         
          Dick and Leroy go stumbling and coughing away from the
          blazing shack, their eyes burning with smoke, blinded. They
          trip over the edge into the dark waters of the CANAL.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          He seems to float off into a reverie.
                         
                                             LEROY
                    Worse thing I ever seen. And the
                    smell, that awful smell -- all
                    cooked flesh. Somehow we ended up
                    in the water.

                                             LEROY (CONT'D)
                    Floating in the blackness, I could
                    still hear all them screams. It
                    wasn't until I surfaced that I
                    could see the truth of it all. Of
                    Derry.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    What truth?
                         
                                             LEROY
                    I saw something, Mikey. Through
                    the smoke and the burning.
                    Something I can't even really
                    explain, but it was there, Dickie
                    saw it, too.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    What did you see?
                         
          A NURSE walks in with a chemo bag.
                         
                                             NURSE
                    Mr. Hanlon, you ready?
                         
          Mike and Leroy lock eyes. Leroy leans in, whispers so the
          nurse can't hear.
                         
                                             LEROY
                    I saw what was really responsible
                    for that fire, Mikey. Not the
                    Legion. See those white boys, they
                    were there, but there was something
                    else, orchestrating `em. Had `em
                    all in a fit and frenzy, moved to
                    his whims. This thing, I don't
                    even know how to describe it...
                         
                         
          EXT. CANAL BESIDE THE BLACK SPOT - NIGHT
                         
          A balloon surfaces from the waters, bringing with it
          PENNYWISE. It pulls him over to a survivor swimming in
          darkness and Pennywise pounces, dragging the victim under
          water.
                         
          Leroy and Dick see this and are horrified. They begin
          swimming back to the edge when a balloon surfaces nearby,
          again pulling Pennywise, his face smeared with blood, from
          the water.
                         
          It drags the clown toward them. They climb out of the canal
          just as Pennywise gets within striking distance. Instead he
          pounces on a woman there, dragging her under kicking and
          screaming.
                                                                     67.
                         
                         
          On the shore Leroy rests in Dick's arms, the Black Spot now
          just a heap of smoldering char, the grounds littered with
          burned up bodies.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
                         
          Mike looks at his father, terrified.
                         
                                             NURSE
                    Mr. Hanlon?
                         
                                             LEROY
                        (he grabs Mike's shirt
                                        VIOLENTLY)
                    Be careful out there son.
                    Especially by the canal. The water
                    in Derry is no place for no one,
                    especially a youngster like you.
                         
          The nurse hooks up the chemo bag to Leroy's IV. She turns
          towards Mike.
                         
                                             NURSE
                    You might want to wait outside.
                         
          Mike hesitantly leaves the room as she pricks the needle into
          his dad's catheter, Leroy wincing.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL, CORRIDER - NIGHT
                         
          Mike steps out into the corridor. The hospital seems eerily
          dark, empty and quiet.
                         
          A LIGHT STROBES down the long hall. It draws Mike to it, like
          a moth to a flame. He turns the corner and sees...
                         
          A fire alarm pulled, white greasy fingerprints on the lever.
          Emergency lights strobe along the walls. No sound of an
          alarm. No doctors or nurses anywhere.
                         
          Suddenly, at the end of the long corridor, a SHEEP trots out
          from a door, staccato in the strobing light. It stops, looks
          at Mike, then trots into another door.
                         
          Mike starts after it, baffled. He approaches the door the
          sheep walked into, a stream of WATER FLOODING OUT ONTO THE
          FLOOR.
                         
          He stops, the water rushing past his feet. He looks back
          behind him, the normally lit hallway now far far away.
                         
                         BAAA
                                                                  68.
                         
                         
          He hears the sheep just inside the open door. He enters
          through it without noticing the stencil on the glass of the
          door: "DERRY COUNTY CORONER."
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL, CORONER'S OFFICE
                         
          Mike enters a windowless bunker like room with all the metal
          corpse lockers, metal autopsy table and a sink in the corner,
          the emergency lights still strobing.
                         
          The sheep is nowhere to be found.
                         
          Instead Mike finds, in the middle of the floor under the
          autopsy table, a DRAIN GURGLING UP WATER, the source of the
          flooding out into the corridor.
                         
          SLAM!
                         
          The door slams behind him. Mike runs over to it, jiggles the
          lock, but it won't open. Behind him, in between flashes of
          the strobe, PENNYWISE APPEARS THEN DISAPPEARS...
                         
          Mike stops dead, sensing It's presence like he did at the old
          Ironworks. He slowly looks back as...
                         
          ONE OF THE CORPSE LOCKER DOORS CREAK OPEN
                         
          Mike opens his mouth to scream but nothing comes out.
                         
          He's pounding on the door.
                         
                                              MIKE
                    Somebody! HELP! Let me out!
                                       (BEAT)
                    Dad! Mom!
                         
          He looks over his shoulder while continuing to BANG. The
          tray inside the open locker slowly slides out, like a tongue
          from a mocking black mouth. On it, under a white sheet, is a
          CORPSE.
                         
          Mike dares look back just as the sheet catches and the corpse
          is uncovered. It's none other than PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER,
          whose legs and arms (up to the elbow) have been bit off,
          smaller, CHILD SIZE bite marks cover his body.
                         
          Mike jumps to a corner where he grabs a saw to defend
          himself.
                         
          Water spews up from the drain with more and more pressure, a
          pool now covering the floor, the edge of which seeps toward
          Mike.
                                                                     69.
                         
                         
          Mike climbs up on a chair, afraid of the water, now with a
          full view of Patrick's mutilated body.
                         
          JUST THEN PATRICK TURNS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS AT MIKE
                         
                                             PATRICK
                    It's killing your daddy, Mikey.
                    Eating him away.
                         
                                              MIKE
                    Shut up.
                         
                                             PATRICK
                    A worm inside a rotten apple.
                    We're all apples, Mikey. All of us.
                    You know the thing about apples --
                         
                                              MIKE
                    Stop it.
                         
          Patrick's expression turns into a horrific, fearful murmur.
                         
                                             PATRICK
                    -- they float.
                         
                                              MIKE
                    No!
                         
          THE WALLS START TO SLIDE IN. As if the room were shrinking.
          The walls shepherding him towards Patrick's talking corpse.
                         
          Mike reaches behind him, scraping at the walls, looking for
          anything with purchase. His hands find the FIRE ALARM.
          Pulls it.
                         
          This time the alarm SOUNDS and the strobe lights freeze, the
          room now fully lit.
                         
          Mike looks back, calipers raised, and sees the locker doors
          closed again, no water on the floor.
                         
          The door opens behind him. It's the CORONER, Chief Borton,
          and PATRICK'S PARENTS there to identify the remains of their
          boy.
                         
          Mike is nearly catatonic.   He holds onto the Chief, catching
          his breath.
                         
                                             CHIEF BORTON
                    What are you doing here, son?
                         
          Speechless and terrified Mike races past them out of the
          hospital.

          EXT. OLD CAPE STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Mike walks home, distraught, mindless to the traffic. He is
          nearly hit by a car as he storms away from the hospital.
                         
          A Trans Am turns a corner behind him.   Headlights on high-
          beam. It stops.
                         
          Mike turns, sees, realizes who it is, runs.
                         
                         
          INT. TRANS AM - SAME
                         
          Travis climbs out of the passenger seat and over to the
          driver seat.
                         
                                                TRAVIS
                    Move.
                         
          Victor gets out and runs around the car.
                         
                                             SNATCH
                    Hey, ain't that the little shit
                    your dad gave you a whoopin' over?
                         
          Furious, Travis slams on the gas pedal.    POV of CAR, giving
          chase to Mike.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    I'm gonna run him over.
                         
                         
          EXT. DERRY SIDE STREET - SAME
                         
          Mike runs for his life, jumping fences, turning corners, and
          running through pedestrians.
                         
          Travis' Trans-Am can't always speed, due to the amount of
          people on the street.
                         
          Just when he's about to get within biting distance, BOOM.
                         
          The first of a long series of FIRE-WORKS, explodes over the
          Derry sky, illuminating the street in a series of FLASHES.
                         
                         
          EXT. BEN'S HOUSE, ROOFTOP - NIGHT
                         
          Will, Richie, Stan, and Eddie have gathered on Ben's roof to
          watch the fireworks.
                                                                      71.
                         
                         
          BOOM. The boys "oooh" and "aaaah" while stuffing their faces
          with an unholy array of massed snacks meant to rot teeth and
          discolor the fingers with multi-colored MSG filled flavor
          powders.
                         
          Richie, with sticky fingers, picks up a walkie-talkie.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Benny-boy, don't forget the ranch
                    dressing.
                         
          The walkie-talkie SQWUAKS back.
                         
                                             BEN
                    Hey Richie. Eat a bag of dicks.
                         
          BOOM. Again, the sky erupts in dazzling light and color AND
          CONTINUES TO with fireworks THROUGHOUT AND UNTIL THE END OF
          THE FOLLOWING SCENES -- IMAGINE IT AS THE MOST EPIC FIREWORKS
          DISPLAY YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.
                         
          Beverly, then Ben, appear from one of the dormer windows
          leading to Ben's bedroom, with sparklers, bunches of bottle
          rockets, roman candles and small firecrackers.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                        (mimicking Paul Hogan)
                    You call that a firecracker?    This
                    is a firecracker.
                         
          He opens his palms, revealing SEVERAL M-80s.     The boys
          collectively `woah' with excitement.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Nice stick, Richie.     How about
                    this.
                         
          She opens her backpack, revealing a MORTAR with SIX turrets.
                         
                                 ALL THE BOYS
                    Holy shit!
                         
                                             WILL
                    Think that could take "IT" down?
                         
                                      STAN                             EDDIE
          How? We don't even know what      That's a good name for it
          it is that we're looking for.     actually.
                         
                                                RICHIE
                    What?
                         
                                                EDDIE
                    "IT."
                                                                  72.
                         
                         
          They nod in agreement.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    I think it depends.
                         
          Beverly looks up from a SPREAD OF FIREWORKS laid out on a red
          white and blue Captain America towel.
                         
                                              EDDIE
                    On what?
                         
                                             WILL
                    What we're scared of. It was
                    Georgie's corpse for me cuz, cuz
                    that's what I care about. It was a
                    naked woman for Stan because he's
                    so afraid of-
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Getting laiiiid.
                         
                                      STAN                           RICHIE
          Only because your Mom-          You really want me to start
                                          talking about your Mom?
                                          Don't get me started cause it
                                          won't stop.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Back to point. It showered Beverly
                    in blood cuz...
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Cuz blood always freaks a girl out.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Wow, you really don't know shit
                    about girls do you?
                         
          Will smiles.
                         
                                             BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                    "IT" showered me in blood because I
                    just got my period... and...
                         
          Eddie recoils in disgust while Beverly's mind goes to dark
          places, to her father, and what being a "woman" might mean to
          him now. Ben and Will both notice this change in her
          demeanor.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    I didn't need to know that.
                                                                   73.
                         
                         
                                             WILL
                    It. It's everything and anything.
                    All our nightmares. All evil,
                    wrapped into one.
                         
                                             BEN
                    Into one freaky looking clown you
                    mean. That's the only form that
                    seems to repeat.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Ironic right? Something that's
                    suppose to make kids laugh,
                    actually being super freaky.
                         
          He does it Rick James style. Everyone laughs.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    It makes sense though. If it's
                    killing kids. A clown is the
                    perfect cover.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Adults just ignore them. But kids,
                    like your brother, Georgie...
                         
                                             WILL
                    They want to get closer.   See their
                    tricks.
                         
          Just then Will sees MIKE running for his life down the
          street.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    Shit. Isn't that-
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Home school.
                         
          They look where he's running from and see Bowers Gang, in the
          Trans-Am delayed by foot traffic.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    They're going to cream him.
                         
                                             STAN
                    At least it won't be our problem
                    for a night.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    That's cowardly, Stan.
                                                                    74.
                         
                         
                                               BEN
                     Beverly's right. We can't always
                     hide from them. We need to do
                     something.
                         
                                              STAN
                     How?
                         
                                              WILL
                     With these.
                         
          Will points to their arsenal of fireworks.
                         
                                                                           CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. BEN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - MINUTES LATER
                         
          Mike runs past families and kids distracted by the fireworks
          display happening overhead, Bowers gang almost on him in the
          Trans Am.
                         
          Mike cuts between a lawn between two houses, hopping a fence.
          Bowers hits the gas and fishtails it around the next block to
          cut Mike off.
                         
          Will and his gang see this and take a short cut of their own.
          Ben, boy-boobs jiggling, takes up the rear.
                         
                         
          EXT.   NEIBOLT STREET - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
                         
          Mike spills out between lawns on Neibolt street; a dead end.
          There is a small pier that cuts into the canal with an old
          abandoned "lock house" at the end.
                         
          The Trans-Am roars into view at the other end of the block.
          Revs the engine.
                         
                         
          INT. TRANS AM - NIGHT
                         
          Travis is focused on Mike, who is frozen in the street.
                         
                                              TRAVIS

          Another boy runs out with him. Will.

                                                                   75.
                         
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    This night just gets better and
                    better.
                         
          Travis slams on the gas.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Tires screeching.   Travis guns it straight for Mike and Will.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Don't move.
                         
                                               MIKE
                    You nuts?
                         
                                             WILL
                    Trust us. We're here to help you
                    take these jerks.
                         
                                               MIKE
                    We?
                         
          Looking to the side, Will has his walkie-talkie.
                         
                                             WILL
                        (into the walkie-talkie)
                    Not yet... not yet. Now!
                         
          Between the Trans-Am and Mike and Will, Ben and Richie heave
          their shoulders into a large steel DUMPSTER filled with
          construction material. They push it down a driveway that
          leads to the street. It creaks, starts to wobble, then move
          down the incline. When it hits street level, though, the
          gutter stops it from going out into line of the Trans Am.
                         
                                               BEN
                    Fuck.
                         
          Will sees this.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Oh shit. Abort! Abort!
                         
                                             MIKE
                    Abort? What does that mean.
                         
                                               WILL
                    Run!
                         
          They're about to dodge the car when-
                                                                  76.
                         
                         
          BEVERLY jumps out firing off her 6-BARRELED MORTAR handheld,
          aimed horizontally, at the car. THUMP. The recoil throws
          her back while the rocketing projectile explodes in front of
          the Trans-Am. Travis and the boys shield their faces
          SCREAMING as the front windshield explodes.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Woah!
                         
          THUMP. This one knocks her to the ground as the second
          mortar flies right towards the Trans Am. Travis yanks the
          wheel to the LEFT as the firework EXPLODES on the side of the
          car. He slams on the breaks as Victor, Snatch, and Moose are
          flung forward. Victor smashes his face on the dash board.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    Is that girl for real?
                         
                                             WILL
                    Real as it gets... Now, Stan and
                    Eddie!
                         
          Eddie and Stan charge from behind a hedge. Lighting bottle-
          rockets aimed at the car. Travis and his boys have to duck
          for cover as ONE of the rockets ZINGS through the car.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Those little motherfuckers.   Get
                    out, get out!
                         
          The OLDER BOYS climb out the windows, ducking and covering
          their eyes from the ONSLAUGHT of bottle rockets and roman
          candle projectiles.
                         
          Crouched behind the trunk, Travis lights up three M-80's WITH
          CLOWN FACES on them and tosses them like grenades at Beverly,
          Stan, and Eddie's positions.
                         
          The M-80's blow HUGE fist sized holes in the blacktop, bigger
          than can possibly be legal, exploding gravel peppering the
          kids, stunning them for a moment.
                         
                                             STAN
                    Holy hell. What kinda gear do they
                    got?
                         
                                             WILL
                    I don't wanna stay and find out.
                         
          Ben and Richie race up from behind, letting loose another
          barrage as they pass Bowers' gang and the Trans Am, giving
          cover as the FIRE FIGHT, literally, becomes a retreating
          manoeuver towards the pier at the end of Neibolt street.
                                                                    77.
                         
                         
          Travis' boys cover their eyes but they make aggressive
          progress towards the kids with their terrifying M-80's.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    I've been waiting all summer to run
                    into you, Denbrough.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Leave us alone Bowers. I don't
                    want anyone to get seriously hurt.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Hurt? When I'm done with you,
                    you'll wish you were in that storm
                    drain with your brother.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET PIER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They regroup at the mouth of the pier, water on both sides,
          Bowers in front. He throws another M-80, which tears into a
          wood plank. Splinters shoot everywhere.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Will, we need cover--
                         
                                             BEN
                    The house. It's our only chance!
                         
          Ben points to the Neibolt Street house on stilts over the
          black water. An imploded, condemned structure that slopes
          like a man's half eaten face. Eddie is instantly horrified.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    I don't think that's a good idea.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    When do you ever think anything is
                    a good idea?
                         
                                             WILL
                    Okay. Ben, we'll hold him off while
                    we can, you and Stan see if you can
                    find a way in.
                         
          Covering them, Mike, Richie and Will continue to fire off
          what fireworks they have left. Bowers' boys light off another
          barrage of M-80's. Will, armed with a plank bats one back
          like a baseball. BOOM! It explodes at Victors feet.
                         
          Ben quickly runs towards the house, followed by Stan and Bev.
                         
          Eddie, stuck in the middle, goes after them down the pier.
                                                                   78.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Ben and Stan split up looking for a way in.   All windows and
          doors are boarded up or locked.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Really guys, there has to be
                    another option.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    You want to swim?!
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    I'm serious. This house--
                         
                              BEN, STAN, & BEVERLY
                    Shut up, Eddie.
                         
          And then, as if by magic (or by Pennywise), one of the 2x4s
          that cover a window to the basement slips to the ground.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET PIER - NIGHT
                         
          Will finds the backpack empty as Mike shoots off the last
          bottle rocket. Will picks up some rocks as ammo. Mike and
          Richie instinctively follow suit. Will winds up and...
                         
                                               WILL
                    Charge!!!
                         
          NAILS MOOSE IN THE FOREHEAD, drawing blood.
                         
          Travis and the others stop dead, incredulous, as rocks pelt
          them. It turns into a crazy rock fight. Will looks back.
          He can't see any of his friends who are on the other side of
          the house.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                                       (TO BEN)
                    Guys hurry!!!
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Ben and Beverly look at the window into the blackened hole,
          then at each other ominously.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Rock, paper, scissors?
                         
                                               STAN
                    I'll go.
                                                                   79.
                         
                         
          Not wanting to be one-upped by Stan, Ben pushes him out of
          the way.
                         
                                              BEN
                    No.   I'll go.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET PIER - NIGHT
                         
          The fight is getting desperate. Both Will and Mike bleed
          from rock hits. Will, Richie, and Mike see Bev waving them
          to come. They run for their lives towards the house, Travis
          and his goons on their heels.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Will, Richie and Mike round the corner of the house.   Will
          looks down the pier, no one, then THEY HEAR BEN.
                         
                                              BEN
                                       (WHISPERING LOUDLY)
                    Down here!
                         
                              TRAVIS (O.C.)
                    I'm gonna kill you, losers! I swear
                    I'm gonna kill you all.
                         
          Will sees a broomstick wave in the opening, beckoning them to
          come in.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Go! Go! Go!
                         
          Mike and Richie slip in, lowering themselves onto a floor
          littered with crates and boxes. Will last in just as...
                         
          Travis and his buddies round the house. Moose walks right by
          the window they slipped into but doesn't seem to see it.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Where are they?
                         
          Victor and Snatch look at Travis for direction. Unmoved,
          Travis walks around the boarded up house looking for a way
          in.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT
                         
          The kids catch their breath and lick their wounds. The
          basement is a derelict and creepy undercarriage to a canal
          lock house.
                                                                  80.
                         
                         
          A huge coal ENGINE bulked in the shadows, and next to it an
          old COAL BIN and stone channel that leads directly to the
          canal and water.

                    If we die here I just want to say
                    that fight was friggin' awesome.
                         
                                               WILL
                    Shhhhush.
                         
          Richie does a little pistol shoot with his hands to Ben and
          mouths "awesome." Ben smiles.
                         
                                             EDDIE

                    We shouldn't be here.
                         
          Will watches Travis and his boys walk past the basement
          window again. Ben looks to Beverly, sees some gravel in her
          leg like buckshot.
                         
                                             BEN

          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE
                         
          Travis is getting frustrated. He can't find where or how the
          kids have gotten into the house. He looks straight at the
          window the kids crawled through, the 2x4 is still somehow
          attached from the outside.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT
                         
          The kids can see Travis staring straight at them through the
          window, the 2x4 is non-existent, as if Pennywise is
          preventing the boys outside from seeing in or entering.
                         
                                             STAN
                    They can't see the window?

                    Something wrong with your friend

          Eddie?                             He's afraid of dirt.
                         
          Will covers Eddie's mouth as he continues to yell, "we
          shouldn't be here." They watch anxiously as Travis and the
          boys feet inch uncomfortably closer to them.
                         
          Then Eddie suddenly stops.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE - SAME
                         
          Frustrated, Travis and the boys leave.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT
                         
          The kids have surrounded Eddie.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    What is it Eddie?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    There's something I didn't tell you
                    guys.

                                             EDDIE
                    This house. I saw something here
                    once. I thought it was just my
                    mind playing tricks, but now I
                    know...
                         
          They sense what he is about to say isn't going to be good.
                         
                                             EDDIE (CONT'D)
                    I saw "IT."
                         
          Eddie nods.

                    guy?
                         
                                                STAN
                    Wha?
                         
                                             MIKE
                    What does he mean by "IT?"
                         
          Will looks to the gang, they all nod.     He turns back to their
          newest member.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Something's wrong with Derry.
                    Haunting it. Hunting and killing
                    kids. We've all seen it.
                         
          Mike looks at them all, judging their earnestness. Feels he
          can trust them, an instant connection with people whose fear
          clings to your own.
                         
                                              MIKE
                    I know.   I've seen "IT" too.
                         
          Just then, the house seems to shiver. As if its foundation
          had shifted. A CLANKING SOUND resonates from the pipes.
          Water BEGINS TO SEEP in through the cracks in the basement.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    What exactly did you see here,
                    Eddie?
                         
          Ben goes to the window they came through, but instead of
          seeing out, it's now covered by the 2x4.
                         
                                                BEN
                    Guys, uh--
                         
          He looks at their feet. They all do. Water coming in fast.
          Ben bangs a coal stoker against the boarded window. Rock
          solid. Will looks for a way out. The stairs.
                         
                                                WILL
                    Stairs.
                         
          Suddenly they HEAR FOOTSTEPS, above. They look up as dust
          falls from one side of the roof, slowly making its way to
          directly over them. To the stairs.
                         
                                              EDDIE
                        (whispering in fright)
                    It's here.
                                                                        83.
                         
                         
          Will grabs on to Beverly's hand. She holds onto his with
          equal vigor. Richie holds onto Eddie.
                         
          Ben holds the stoker like a sword.     Mike grabs a shovel.
          They lead the way up the stairs.
                         
          Unless otherwise noted, they ONLY WHISPER now.
                         
                                                RICHIE
                       I'm not going up there.
                         
          The others ignore him, follow Ben and Mike up the stairs.
                         
          Richie looks around him at the scary basement, the furnace
          hulking in the corner like a being with eyes. The water
          surrounds his shoes. He runs up after his friends.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR
                         
          A door opens in the middle of the kind of creepy hallway you
          don't want to find yourself in, ever. Scummy yellow water
          stained wallpaper peeling like dead skin from walls. Sconces
          hanging from their sockets and detritus is built up on the
          wooden floor boards. No footprints anywhere.
                         
          Ben sticks his head out. He looks left, nothing, he looks
          right, nothing. Directly in front of him, through a dark
          parlor, is the FRONT DOOR.
                         
          As Ben disappears into the stairs again, the door closes,
          revealing PENNYWISE THE CLOWN, at the far end of the hallway.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, BASEMENT STAIRS
                         
          Ben still has his hand on the door knob.
                         
                                                BEN
                       The front door is right there.
                         
          Will nods.    Let's go.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR
                         
          Pennywise is gone.
                         
          The kids all file out, sticking close to the filthy walls.
          They dart into the dark parlor for the door, followed last by
          Richie...
                         
          The room seems to extend and last longer than anticipated.
          Finally they get to the door. Ben tries it. Nailed shut.
                                                                  84.
                         
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Shit. Guys, look.
                         
          Everyone turns and sees HUNDREDS OF CROWS perched atop the
          railing of the main staircase and in the rafters above.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    There must be a window open.
                         
          Will reads his mind, an upstairs window might be their only
          chance to freedom.
                         
                                             WILL
                    C'mon.
                         
          Will leads the way upstairs.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR
                         
          The children, petrified, slide up the stairs as silently as
          possible, trying not to disturb the watching crows. Or alert
          whatever else is there. The stairs creak and snap loudly.
                         
          They get to a 2nd floor hallway, the wind from an open window
          blowing trash around. Will looks around...
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM
                         
          He beckons them into a bedroom with AN OPEN WINDOW. They
          step over a moldy bare mattress shoved against the wall.
                         
          Beverly is the first one out the window, then Stan, then
          Richie, then Ben. Ben looks back and sees Eddie standing by
          the doorway to the hallway.
                         
                                             BEN
                    Eddie, what are you doing?
                         
          Eddie turns towards them, realizes he must have lost
          consciousness for a second, doesn't understand why he was
          standing there. He walks towards the window when
                         
          THE FLOOR GIVES WAY and he tumbles down to the first floor.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN
                         
          If the house weren't spooky enough, this room is the
          spookiest. A bunch of furniture is gathered in the middle of
          the room covered in sheets. A dusty old refrigerator stands
          in the corner. Dust everywhere begins to clear from Eddie's
          fall. He is knocked out. His arm is clearly broken.
                                                                     85.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR
                         
          Will, Mike, and Ben rush back into the house.
                         
                                                WILL
                    Eddie!
                         
          Will runs around the gaping hole in the floor and tries to
          run down the stairs when...
                         
          THE FLOCK OF CROWS ATTACK
                         
          Will covers his eyes as the birds prevent him from going
          down. Mike and Ben shore themselves behind him.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM
                         
          The other kids scream from the window.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    What's happening?!
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Whatever it is, we don't want to go
                    back in there.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    We have to do something.
                         
          She looks around.
                         
                                                BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                    Follow me!
                         
          Beverly leads Richie and Stan down to the edge of the roof.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR
                         
          Will, Mike, and Ben are being pelted by the birds still.
          They retreat back into the bedroom and shut the door.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN
                         
          Eddie, coming back to consciousness, looks around the room.
          He moans in pain.
                         
                                                EDDIE
                    Guys?
                         
          From the hole above, Will and Ben appear.
                                                                    86.
                         
                         
                                             WILL
                    Eddie.
                         
          Realizing he is alone.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Get me out of here.
                         
                                             WILL
                    We tried, we can't get down stairs.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    What do you mean you can't get down
                    stairs?
                         
          Eddie looks around the creepy room at the sheets.   Something
          horrible could be under any one of them.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Do you see anything you could use
                    to climb out?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    I- I think I broke my arm.
                         
          He holds it up and the lower part of his arm hangs
          irregularly. Behind him the old refrigerator SHAKES,
          SOMETHING INSIDE.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          It's 15 feet sheer drop above the dilapidated pier.    Richie
          is too scared to jump.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    I don't know, Richie.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    You gotta a better idea?
                         
          Glass breaks and CROWS STORM OUT OF A WINDOW behind them.
          Startled, they all lose their footing and fall, crashing down
          onto a pile of rope below.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN
                         
          Eddie looks to the shaking fridge. Blood oozes out of it and
          starts to cover the floor, inching towards him. Eddie backs
          away, horrified.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    No. No no no. Will?     Help me!
                                                                  87.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR BEDROOM
                         
          Will sees the blood, looks to Ben and Mike.
                         
                                             WILL
                    What do we do?
                         
                                             BEN
                    We can't leave him alone down
                    there.
                         
          Mike looks at the old moldy mattress.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, KITCHEN
                         
          Eddie hops onto a rocking chair as the whole floor is coated
          with BLOOD.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Hurry, guys!
                         
          The fridge door starts to YAWN OPEN. Eddie curls in a ball
          and closes his eyes.
                         
                                              EDDIE (CONT'D)
                    This isn't happening. This isn't
                    happening.
                         
          Inside is Pennywise, all curled up. He unfurls himself like
          a coiled snake, holding a balloon on a string. It drags him,
          floating just above the bloody floor, across the room toward
          Eddie.
                         
                                             PENNYWISE
                    Open your eyes Eddie-bear. I
                    brought you some cracker-jack.
                         
                                              EDDIE
                    Go away!
                         
                                             PENNYWISE
                    Away? But I just got here? And
                    we're gonna have soooooo much fun,
                    you and me. Now open those
                    peepers.
                         
                                              EDDIE
                    No.
                         
                                             PENNYWISE
                    Kee-mon Eddie Bear. Don'cha wanna
                    see the show? You're the main
                    event.
                                                                     88.
                         
                         
          Eddie does. Pennywise is over him now, his teeth like razors,
          his clawed hands reaching out for Eddie's neck.
                         
                                             PENNYWISE (CONT'D)
                    You all taste soooooooo much better
                    when you're afraid.
                         
          Eddie screeeeeeeeeams!
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR
                         
          Mike lifts up the mattress and sees a decomposed corpse of
          some child underneath it. He screams, falling backwards
          towards Will and Ben.
                         
                         
          INT. NEIBOLT STREET HOUSE, KITCHEN
                         
          SUDDENLY ALL THREE OF THEM
                         
          Fall onto Pennywise, smacking into the floor, blood
          splattering the walls, impact cushioned by Pennywise's body.
          They instantly fall to the side.
                         
          Will, Mike and Ben look over to see what broke their fall- a
          just as startled Pennywise, writhing in anger.
                         
                                               WILL
                    Ah, fuck!
                         
          Eddie scurries away from Pennywise, who bares his fangs at
          Will.
                         
          CRASH!
                         
          Just then the board from the window rips off to Richie, Stan
          and Beverly.
                         
          She fires a bottle rocket at Pennywise's face, exploding
          right into his eye. The clown reels back howling.
                         
          Richie and Ben jump in and grab Eddie.
                         
          Pennywise pulls the rocket out of his burned socket and
          growls at the boys, morphing into an ORANGE GAS that shoots
          back into the fridge.
                         
          Eddie, Ben and Richie climb to safety through the window,
          while Will watches from the window frame Pennywise's escape.
                                                                   89.
                         
                         
          EXT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The kids BANG on Mrs. Kaspbrak's door. She opens it, sees his
          broken arm and freaks.
                         
                         
          EXT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Mrs. Kaspbrak is placing Eddie in the front seat of their
          family car. He is delirious with pain.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK
                    You! You all did this!
                         
          She slams the door shut, hurting Eddie on the inside.   The
          kids are all too spooked to talk coherently.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D)
                    You know how delicate he is!
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    We were attacked, Mrs. K. Travis
                                   BOWERS AND--
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK
                    Stop it! Just stop it! If it
                    weren't for you boys and that
                    little tramp they'd have nothing
                    against my Eddie-bear... Ohh, where
                    are my keys?
                         
          She's nearly in tears searching her purse. She dumps it out
          on the ground, prescription bottles, used kleenex's, food,
          deflated balloons. Gets on her knees and picks through it.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D)
                    Eddie's done with you kids, you
                    hear?
                         
          She gets up when she finds the car key, speaking with such
          vitriolic focus, she seems possessed.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D)
                    Don't come around here again, you
                    don't deserve him. You're reckless,
                    churlish little boys.
                                       (TO WILL)
                    This is why your little brother
                    died, William, because you are a
                    LOSER, a reckless reckless reckless
                    loser. God help me if I were one
                    of your parents.
                                                                    90.
                         
                         
          She gets in the car and screeches away towards the hospital.
          They ALL watch the car disappear down the street.

          Tilt down to the OVERHEAD shot of what we expect to be "Derry
          1988", but instead we see forests, logging trails, a
          hardscrabble 19th century downtown, and a LOG CABIN SALOON
          squatting on the edge of the swollen Kenduskeag canal. Smoke
          billows from its chimney, day drawing down to a misty dark.

          Follow from behind, a MAN in a lumberjack's jacket walking
          through the muddy, waterlogged street, a double-bited ax
          slung over his shoulder.
                         
          A WOMAN pleads with the Sheriff on the side of the street.
                         
                                             WOMAN

                    three days!
                         
          She sees the MAN.

          poorly into the wood over the door.
                         
                         
          INT. SILVER DOLLAR SALOON - NIGHT
                         
          Dozens of loggers are bellied up at the bar, drinking beers,
          spitting chew on the sawdust covered floor. The man with the
          ax, CLAUDE HEROUX, elbows himself a place at the bar and
          throws down a TWO DOLLAR BILL.
                                                                   92.
                         
                         
          The bartender brings Heroux a schooner of beer, one
          hardboiled egg in a bowl, a shaker of salt and some change.
          Heroux salts the egg and the beer, his piercing eyes stuck on
                         
          A CARD GAME AT A TABLE OF 5 MEN IN BACK
                         
          He devours the egg, downs the beer, then lets out a belch.
          The man next to him gives a friendly nod. Heroux doesn't
          respond. He kicks back from the bar, dragging his ax behind.
                         
          Heroux walks past a piano being played, whispers something
          into the players ear, then throws the change from his meal --
          $1.85 -- onto the piano top. The piano player tips his hat
          and changes tune to something more festive, manic almost.
                         
          Heroux continues into the back, walking like a man in a half
          dream.
                         
          At the table, EL KATOOK deals out a hand to a group of
          railroad bulls -- TINKER MCCUTCHEON, FLOYD CALDERWOOD,
          "STUGLEY" GRENIER, and EDDIE KING, a bearded man whose
          spectacles are almost as fat as his gut.
                         
                                             FLOYD CALDERWOOD
                    You sitting in Claude?
                         
          Floyd reaches out to grab his hand when...
                         
          THUNK!
                         
          Heroux's ax falls, chopping of Floyd's hand at the wrist.
          Floyd recoils back shrieking, blood spurting from the stump,
          his severed hand remaining on the table.
                         
          At the bar somebody calls for more beer. The bartender takes
          a casual look back just in time to see...
                         
          Heroux bury his ax in Tinker McCutchoen's head. The big man
          tries to get up, blood pouring down his face, then sits back
          down again. A second chop finishes him.
                         
          Floyd, writhing under the table, gropes for his hand on the
          table above it. Heroux chops his other hand off, Floyd
          screams even louder.
                         
          Laughter from the bar as patrons rub the bartender's bald
          head for luck. The piano playing only gets more giddy and
          festive, then we see who's playing it:
                         
          PENNYWISE, fingers dancing across the keys like a virtuoso.
                         
          Heroux turns to Ed Katook, who struggles to pull his clutch
          pistol from its shoulder holster. He slings the ax sideways
          just as Katook gets the pistol out, burying it in his back.
                                                                  93.
                         
                         
          CRACK!
                         
          A shot goes off. But at the bar, conversation between two
          loggers turns to the weather. This winter will be a jeezer.
                         
          Fat Eddie King falls to the floor trying to crab away from
          the table. Heroux, bloody ax dragging on the floor, comes
          over to the fat man who pleads.
                         
                                             EDDIE KING
                    Please Claude, I just got married
                    last month.
                         
          The ax comes down into Eddie's ample gut. Blood sprays all
          the way up to the Dollar's beamed roof.
                         
          Men at the bar laugh and eat their boiled eggs, dully aware
          of the gorefest behind them.
                         
          Heroux pulls the ax out of his gut like you would a softwood
          tree, rocking it back and forth. It finally comes free and he
          brings it down again.
                         
          THWAP!
                         
          Eddie's severed head goes rolling over toward the bar, right
          to the foot of a drunk, who without breaking his call for
          another drink, kicks it away.
                         
          In back, Heroux turns to the last man cowering in the corner:
          Stugley Grenier. He takes a swing and Stugley ducks it, ax
          splintering the floor.
                         
          Stugley scrambles into the OUTHOUSE and closes the door
          behind. Heroux, now totally slicked with blood, stalks over
          and begins chopping his way in.
                         
          He finds the windowless room empty. A sound comes from deep
          in the pooping hole. He looks down just in time to see...
                         
          Stugley's boots disappear through the pool of shit and piss.
                         
          Heroux steps out of the outhouse into the carnage of the back
          room. Exhausted and bloody from tip to toe, he takes a seat
          at the card table, props his ax next to him, and starts
          drinking what's left of the slaughtered men's beers.
                         
          No one in the saloon seems to pay much mind to this. No one
          except Pennywise at the piano, who takes great pleasure in
          the scene and the ditty he's playing, a greasy white smile on
          his giddy, evil face...
                                                                   94.

                    crypt."
                         
                                      BEN                             STAN
          No, no. This is far too         I don't want to see "it"
          whacked for "Tales."            again. Ever.
                         
                                             WILL
                    I don't think that's a choice,
                    Stan. "IT" knows we know. We hurt
                    it. It's going to want to hurt us
                    back.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    It's only a matter of time one of
                    us is found half eaten in the
                    Barrens. Or worse.
                         
          This is too much for Stan. He grabs his backpack.
                         
                                             STAN
                    I need to study for my bar-mitzvah.
                         
          Stan goes. All the kids look to each other.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    He's just scared.
                         
                                             WILL
                    We're all scared. That's what it
                    feeds off of. I heard the clown
                    tell Eddie as much. Our only
                    defense is to stick together.
                                                                     96.
                         
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Yeah well, the only time I've been
                    spooked is when I'm with you
                    jokers. I'm thinking I might be
                    safer at home. At least I know my
                    parents won't try to kill me.
                         
          Richie goes too, leaving just the four.
                         
                         
          INT. WILL'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Will enters the back door and grabs Stan's invitation for his
          Bar-Mitzvah off the fridge:
                         
                         
                               HAROLD AND RUTH URIS

                           THE BAR-MITZVAH OF THEIR SON
                                                  STANLEY URIS

                            SATURDAY, AUGUST 13TH, 1988
                         
          He hears fighting in the hallway.
                         
                                             SHARON
                    Put it back up there! Put it back
                    now!
                         
                                             ZACH
                    I just thought, someone else--
                         
                         
          INT. WILL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          His mother stands in the way of his father who holds the
          chest of Georgie's toys.
                         
                                             SHARON
                    I don't care about anyone else. I
                    care about Georgie. I care about my
                    little boy who's gone.
                         
                                              WILL
                    Hey.
                         
          They both startle and look at Will standing there.
                         
                                             ZACH
                    Willy, we need a minute--
                         
                                             WILL
                    Why? To scream at each other more?
                                                                  97.

                    This is between your father and me.
                         
                                             WILL
                    And Georgie right? You, dad, and
                    Georgie.
                         
                                             ZACH
                    Willy, stop.
                         
                                             WILL
                    No. You stop. I hate   it. Tip toeing
                    around you guys like   I don't exist.
                    Like I'm the one who   died and the
                    only one who's still   here is Ge--
                         
          SLAP!
                         
          His mother hits him hard. She instantly regrets it. She runs
          down the stairs sobbing. Zach reaches out a comforting hand.
                         
                                               ZACH
                    You okay?
                         
                                             WILL
                    What do you care? At least she
                    heard me.
                         
                                               ZACH

                                             WILL
                    I miss Georgie, too.

                    We know.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Do you? Because it seems like
                    every adult in this town is blind
                    to what's really happening, blind
                    to what any of us kids are going
                    through.
                         
          Will shoulders past his father and runs out the door.
                         
                         
          EXT. CORNER OF WITCHAM AND JACKSON - DAY
                         
          Will sits on the curb across from the storm drain that killed
          Georgie. His eyes burn with anger. He stares into the dark
          void, half expecting Pennywise's face to appear any moment.
                                                                    98.
                         
                         
                                             WILL
                    C'mon, clown. Show your ugly face!
                    I'll stick another firecracker in
                    it for Georgie. Blow your whole
                    stupid head off. Send you back to
                    wherever a creeper like you comes
                    from. Where are you!?
                         
          He listens for a response. Nothing. Just the bubbling sound
          of water rushing through the sewer. Water. Something dawns
          on Will.
                         
                         
          EXT. OLD IRONWORKS - DAY
                         
          Will bikes up to the edge of the hulking old structure.   He
          clocks the river flowing just beyond.
                         
          Hundreds of black ravens, the same birds from Neibolt, watch
          him from perches all along the skeletal structure.
                         
                         
          EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Will sees Bev's mom leave for work, then bikes around back
          where he clocks a tangle of pipes protruding from the back of
          the building down into a MORLOCK HOLE marked Derry Sewer.
                         
          Mr. Marsh watches Bill from the window above.
                         
                         
          EXT. BARRENS - DAY
                         
          Will tramps down to the spot where he found the shoe. He
          looks back down the stream, water trickling out of the sewer
          pipe into the Barrens. The water.
                         
          Something watches him from inside the cylinder of the pipe.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIBOLT STREET - DAY
                         
          Will bikes up to the mouth of the pier, the house suspended
          over the canal, its imploded facade seeming to gape back at
          Will like Munch's "The Scream." Water again. In Will's
          mind, it all comes together.
                                                                        99.
                         
                         
          EXT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Eddie and his mom sit on the couch and watch soaps. Eddie
          plays with a loose thread of his cast, twisting it in his
          fingers, not a friend's signature anywhere.
                         
                         KRSSSST
                         
                              WILL (O.S.)
                    Eddie? Eddie you there?
                         
          His walkie crackles from a high shelf over the TV. Mrs.
          Kaspbrack looks at her son, eyebrows raised.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK
                    I thought I took the batteries out
                    of that thing?
                         
          Eddie shakes his head, as if to say he didn't know.     She
          points for him to get it.
                         
                              WILL (O.S.)
                    Eddie? I know where to find--
                         
          He grabs the walkie, holds it tenderly in his hands.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK
                    Turn it off.
                         
          He complies.   BANG BANG BANG.   They both look at the door.
                         
                         
          INT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR
                         
          Mrs. Kaspbrak angrily swings open the door. A surprised DR.
          HANDOR, Eddie's general practitioner, is on the porch there.
                         
                             MRS. KASPBRAK
                    Oh! Dr. Handor. You gave me a
                    fright.
                         
          She spots Will over his shoulder, straddling his bike in the
          middle of the street.
                         
                                MRS. KASPBRAK (CONT'D)
                    C'mon in.
                         
          They step inside.   Will pockets his Walkie and goes.
                         
                         
          INT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE, EDDIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Dr. Handor checks Eddie's cast.
                                                                 100.
                         
                         
                              DR. HANDOR
                    How you feeling, son? Any pain?
                         
                                              EDDIE
                    No.   Feels fine I guess.
                         
                              DR. HANDOR
                    Kept the cast pretty clean, I see.
                    Didn't you want any of your friends
                    to sign it?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    I'm not allowed to see them.
                         
                               DR. HANDOR
                    Why not?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    My Mom thinks they're the reason I
                    got hurt. She says I'm sensitive
                    and they don't take care of me like
                    she does.
                         
          Dr. Handor wants to say something, but hesitates.
                         
                              DR. HANDOR
                    She means your allergies?   Is that
                    it?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Yeah. Mom says I should always
                    carry my Epi-pen with me, in case I
                    ever have an episode.
                         
                              DR. HANDOR
                    Mother knows best. Is that it?
                         
          Eddie shrugs.
                         
          Dr. Handor smiles, considering his next thought. He leans in,
          too close for comfort for Eddie. For a moment it's creepy.
                         
                              DR. HANDOR (CONT'D)
                    Eddie, do you know what a placebo
                    is?
                         
                         
          EXT. TRAVIS BOWER'S BACKYARD - DAY
                         
          A bottle of Southern Comfort sits on a log. BLAM!
                         
          Bowers shoots at it with his dad's police issue .45. Victor
          and Snatch look on, giggling.
                                                                   101.
                         
                         
          He finally tags it, the bottle shattering into a thousand
          pieces. They all whoop and holler.
                         
                                                SNATCH
                    Can I try?
                         
          He reaches for the gun.    Bowers pushes him back.
                         
                                            TRAVIS
                    Sure. Go put the next target out
                    there.
                         
          Travis points to the cat that's lounging there in the grass.
                         
                                             SNATCH
                    You're foolin' right?
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Do I look like I'm foolin' numb
                    nuts?
                         
          Snatch grabs the kitty and runs out to the stump. He wipes
          away the glass and sets the cat down. It starts to meow and
          tries to get away.
                         
                                             SNATCH
                    It's not staying.
                         
          Bower lines up a shot, sight of the barrel on the cat.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Hold it there, butt cheese.
                         
                              OFFICER BOWERS (O.C.)
                    What the hell is this?
                         
          Officer Bowers steps from his police cruiser in the driveway.
          His face as red as fire.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Nothing, pa. Just cleaning your
                    gun like you asked.
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    Cleaning my gun, huh?
                         
          He stalks up and grabs the gun from Travis. Smells it.
                         
          WHAP! He smacks Travis hard in the face, knocking the big boy
          to the grass.
                         
                              OFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D)
                    Normally I use a rod and cleaner
                    not bullets and whiskey.

                              OFFICER BOWERS (CONT'D)
                    You two punks put your sticky
                    little fingers on my firearm here?
                         
          Victor and Snatch are too scared to talk.
                         
                                             VICTOR
                    N-N-No sir.
                         
          Butch turns the gun on Travis at his feet.
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                    You're not worth the salt you lick
                    boy. I don't know how I let you
                    squirm your way out your momma's
                    womb.
                         
                                                TRAVIS
                    Pa, I'm---
                         
          BLAM!
                         
          He shoots the ground around     Travis feet. Travis squeals like
          a girl, utterly terrified.      BLAM! BLAM! A large wet stain
          spreads around his crotch.      Butch Bowers raises the pistol,
          as if he were about to whip     Travis, who falls to the ground.
                         
          Butch shakes his head.
                         
                                             OFFICER BOWERS
                        (to the boys)
                    Look at him now boys. Nothing like
                    a little fear to make a paper man
                    crumble.
                                       (TO TRAVIS)
                    Clean your drawers `fore you come
                    inside.
                         
          He spits out his disgust, stalks inside.
                         
          Victor and Snatch tip-toe over to Travis, not knowing what to
          say or do. Travis does everything he can not to cry.
                         
                                             VICTOR
                    You okay, Travis?
                         
          An odd wind stirs through the grass there, a yellow menacing
          gathering of clouds overhead. Travis suddenly notices...
                         
          A BALLOON, bobbing over his mailbox, string connected to
          something stuffed inside.
                         
          Travis pushes past his two cronies and goes over to the
          mailbox. Inside he pulls out THE KNIFE. The one he lost at
          the beginning. And attached to the string a note:
                                                                 103.
                         
                         
                         
                            TO:     MR. TRAVIS BOWERS
                            FROM:   MR. ROBERT GRAY
                         
          A murderous look screws onto Travis' face as he turns his
          attention to his house. And his pa inside.
                         
          He snaps the string and starts toward the front door with the
          knife. The balloon floats up into the darkening sky.
                         
                         
          INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          A THUNDERCLAP outside. The coroner steps out the door. Will
          and Mike slip in behind him, Will propping open the door with
          his Walkie.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    Patrick was in one of the lockers.
                    All the water bubbled up from
                    there.
                         
          The drain. Will goes to it. Gazes down into the blackness.
                         
                                             WILL
                    The sewers.

                    What?
                         
                                             WILL
                    "IT." Whenever it shows up,
                    there's always water around. The
                    storm drain where Georgie died.
                    The leak in my room. Beverly's
                    sink.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    My dad saw it near water, too.      The
                    canal.
                         
                                             WILL
                    I'll bet if you trace every
                    terrible event in Derry you'll find
                    the same thing. Water. With the
                    Penobscot river on one side and
                    Kenduskeag canal cutting through
                    it's impossible to escape.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    Unless you live way out in the
                    sticks like I do. We have to tell
                    the others.
                                                                 104.
                         
                         
          Will realizes something.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Shit, Stan's bar mitzvah.   I almost
                    forgot.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    I wasn't invited.
                         
          Will hands him his invite.
                         
                                             WILL
                    You are now. Let's go!
                         
          A pair of YELLOW EYES glow from the drain.
                         
                         
          INT. BEVERLY'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Beverly, all gussied up in a pretty white dress, heads for
          the door. A hand snatches out from behind and seizes her arm.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    Where you think you going girl?

                              MR. MARSH
                    You're all prettied up. Who you all

                    No one.
                         
          He shoves her against the wall, eyes her little body up and
          down. Caresses her hair.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    Don't lie to me, Bevvie. You know
                    how I worry about you. I worry a
                    lot.

                    People in town seen you. Got to
                    sayin' things. Like how my little
                    girl been sneakin' around all
                    summer long with a pack of boys.
                    Only girl to the pack.
                                                                 105.

          He squeezes her cheeks with one hand, holding her head in
          place.
                         
                              MR. MARSH

                    I-- I swear. They're just friends.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    Friends? I know what's in them
                    boys minds when they look at you,
                    Bevvie. I know all too well. They
                    want to do bad things. Did you let
                    them do bad things to you?
                         
          He looms over her. Something in his manner is detached. Like
          he's there but isn't there.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    I'm a good girl daddy. Good, just
                    like you raised me.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    Is that so? Then what's this?
                         
          He pulls out Ben's Haiku Poem.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                                   WHERE'D YOU--
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    You had it squirreled away in your
                    underwear drawer. Why would you
                    want to hide it with your underwear
                    Bevvie? What else are you holdin'
                    out from me.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    It's nothing, daddy.   Just a poem.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                                       (RECITING)
                    Your hair is winter fire,
                                   JANUARY EMBERS
                    My heart burns there, too
                         
          He grabs her by the hair and pulls her up to him.
                                                                 106.
                         
                         
                              MR. MARSH (CONT'D)
                    Sounds lusty to me. Who wrote it.
                    Which one of your boyfriends?
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    I told you I don't have one.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    Don't lie to me!
                         
          He drags her down the hall by the hair.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Daddy stop. You're hurting me.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    You're ma says you're a woman now.
                    You bled. What other womanly
                    things you been doing down in the
                    deep dark woods with those boys,
                    Bevvie.
                         
          He throws her into his bedroom.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Nothing. Please, daddy. You don't
                    have to worry. I promise. Please!
                         
                               MR. MARSH
                    Let's see then. Prove to me you
                    been good.
                         
          She doesn't know what he means.
                         
                              MR. MARSH (CONT'D)
                    Take off your tights.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    What?
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    I love you Bevvie. You're special.
                    You're such a pretty girl. But
                    there's plenty of boys happy to
                    roon a pretty girl. Plenty of
                    pretty girls willing to be roont. I
                    need to know if you're intact.
                         
          He unbuckles his belt, but he doesn't look at her like he
          wants to whip her, there's another hunger in his eyes.
                         
                              MR. MARSH (CONT'D)
                    Your tights, girl. Take `em off.
                                                                 107.
                         
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Daddy, please.
                         
          He slides off his belt and grabs her, smiling, a smile that
          feels all too reminiscent of a clown.
                         
                              MR. MARSH
                    You'll like it, Bevvie.   Be like
                    you're floating.
                         
          Bev kicks him in the balls. Her father lets go, crumpling
          down. She knees him in the face as hard as she can, his head
          flying back into the side of the door.
                         
          Beverly tries to race out the door but he snatches her ankle
          and she trips into the hallway. By the time she is up he is
          lunging towards her.
                         
          She stumbles back into the bathroom and shuts the door,
          trying to lock herself inside. He kicks the door open before
          the lock catches.
                         
          Without thinking Bev grabs the toilet top and smashes it in
          her dad's face. He slumps down, unconscious.
                         
          She rushes out, then uses a chair propped against the knob to
          shut him in the bathroom. Terrified she races out the front
          door.
                         
                         
          INT. EDDIE KASPBRAK'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Eddie stands in front of his mom, eyes blazing.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK
                    Placebo? Who told you that? Dr.
                    Handor? He has no right. No right
                    to say you're making up your
                    sickness.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Not me, momma... You.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK
                    What?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    He said I was never allergic until
                    you made me start carrying around
                    my Epi-pen. You put those allergies
                    in my head.
                                                                  108.
                         
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK
                    That's a lie, Eddie! A bold faced
                    lie. You're my treasure. The only
                    thing I want in this world is to
                    see you safe and healthy.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Then why did you send my friends
                    away?
                         
          She starts to feel the fluttery bird of panic.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK
                    They were bad boys. You know that.
                    And you... You were so sick when
                    you were little. So very sick. It
                    hurt me so much. I never want to
                    see you go through that again. And
                    I've kept you healthy, haven't I?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    You lied to me mamma. You've been
                    giving me medicine that's not
                    really medicine.
                         
                              MRS. KASPBRAK
                    Eddie-bear, please--
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    This is what's going to happen now.
                         
          He pulls out his Epi-pen and throws it in the trash.   Mrs.
          Kaspbrak gasps.
                         
                                             EDDIE (CONT'D)
                    I'm going out that door and you
                    won't stop me. I'm going to my
                    friend Stan's bar-mitzvah and when
                    I come home you're never going to
                    tell how weak or sick or delicate I
                    am ever again.
                         
          THUNDER crackles outside.
                         
                         
          EXT. DERRY STREETS - DAY
                         
          Will and Mike tear through the howling rain on their bikes.
          They almost collide into Beverly who comes dashing around a
          corner.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Bev. You okay?
                                                                    109.
                         
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    No. No I'm not.
                         
          She looks back over her shoulder, terrified and wet and
          shivering.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    What happened. Bowers?
                         
                                              BEVERLY
                    No.   My daddy. He... he...
                         
                                              WILL
                    What?   What did he do Beverly?
                         
          She looks at both of them, tears running down her face, her
          pretty dress soaked in the rain.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    I don't know. I don't know if it
                    was him, or...
                         
                                                MIKE
                    What?
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    I think "IT" was there, controlling
                    him, I don't know, I can't go back,
                    I can't go back, Will. I don't know
                                   WHAT-
                         
          She starts to cry on Will's shoulder. Will looks at Mike.
          They both look up at the convulsive yellow sky. SOMETHING
          BIG is about to happen and they both know it.
                         
                         
          INT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY
                         
          With torrential downpour outside, leaking water drips from
          the ceiling onto the crowd below, who have cheerfully
          employed umbrellas indoor to deal with the nuisance.
                         
          Stan is giving a nervous, but otherwise successful reading of
          the Torah, despite the howling wind and end of days vibe.
                         
          Richie and Ben sit in the back in their little jackets.
                         
                                             BEN
                    This storm is crazy.   Like the
                    sky's gonna fall.
                         
          SLAM! Everyone looks back towards the door, blown open by
          the wind, and at Eddie, who sheepishly was trying to slip in.
                                                                    110.
                         
                         
          Stan smiles at his friend, pleased he's out of "mom jail."
          The CANTOR gives him a nudge and continues reading.
                         
          Eddie slides in meekly next to Richie and Ben, checking his
          clip-on bowtie.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                        (through his teeth)
                    Way to make an entry, Eddie-bear.
                         
                                             BEN
                    How'd you escape?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Guess I'm not as weak as I thought.
                         
                         
          INT. TRAVIS BOWER'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The front door creaks open, Victor and Snatch poking their
          heads in, both soaked to the bone.
                         
                                                SNATCH
                    Travis?
                         
                                             VICTOR
                    Mr. Bowers?
                         
          Nothing. They see a streak of blood on the floor that leads
          to the KITCHEN and Butch Bowers on the linoleum floor in a
          red pool, stabbed dozens of times, the knife left in his eye.
                         
                                                SNATCH
                    Holy shit.
                         
          Victor vomits.   The cat slips in and starts licking up the
          blood.
                         
                                             SNATCH (CONT'D)
                    Travis, dude, you okay?
                         
          Snatch continues on into the LIVING ROOM where he finds
          TRAVIS sitting in Butch's favorite Lazy-boy in front of the
          TV, which is turned on to PENNYWISE THE CLOWN SHOW.
                         
          He holds the .45, All slicked in blood, his eyes glazed.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    It's my gun now.
                         
          He turns and looks at Snatch and Victor in the doorway.
                                                                 111.
                         
                         
          INT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY
                         
          The STORM GROWLS outside. Richie, Ben and Eddie look at each
          other, a little on edge. Suddenly the doors crash open again
          and Stan stops, once again, looking up...
                         
          Will, Bev, and Mike slink into the back of the synagogue,
          soaking wet. The Rabbi's wife shoots them a look of daggers.
                         
                         
          INT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY
                         
          The reading is over and the crowd starts to gather to leave
          for the reception. Will, Bev, Ben, Richie, Eddie, and Mike
          are all huddled together. Stan is the only one not there.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    What do you mean your dad attacked
                    you?
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    It was like that lumberjack Ben
                    told us about. The one from the
                    Silver Dollar. He had this look.
                    Like someone was pushing him to do
                    it.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Not someone. "IT".
                         
          Eddie, thinking about his mother.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    You guys, if "IT" can take over
                    Beverly's parents, why not the rest
                    of ours?
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    I can't go back there guys. He'll
                    kill me. Or worse.
                         
          This sinks in to everyone. There's only one thing they can
          do.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    Will knows where to find "IT."
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    What do you mean?
                         
                                             WILL
                    The sewers. Me and Mike figured it
                    out. That's how it gets around.
                    That's where it lives.
                                                                   112.

                    count me in.
                         
          Beverly looks at Ben, consistently impressed by his defense
          of her.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Wait, count you in to what?

                    storm?
                         
          Water is actively dripping on them.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Get rid of "IT" before "IT" gets
                    rid of us, one by one. It doesn't
                    know what to do when all of us are
                    together, you have to believe me.
                         
                         
          INT./EXT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY
                         
          Stan shakes hands with his aunts and uncles near the front
          door. The wind whips up the women's dresses and unhinges
          umbrellas. Will and the gang run to him and whisk him out.
                         
                                               STAN
                    Hey guys.    How'd I do?
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    I hope your schlong grew those 12
                    inches cuz you're gonna need it.

                    C'mon!
                         
          The storm picks up force, wind blowing umbrellas inside out
          and from the hands of guests trudging back to the parking
          lot. One goes tumbling across the gardens and into...
                         
          THE BLACK BOILING RIVER and sinks into the dark water.
                                                                  113.
                         
                         
          INT. ZACH DENBROUGH'S WORKSHOP - DAY
                         
          Will and the gang arrive like their own hurricane in the dark
          cellar workshop. Whipping around the room and picking up
          objects, Will unfurls a map on his dad's work table.
                         
          The other kids stock up on whatever armor or weapons they can
          find -- crossbow, hockey pads, a hubcap as shield, a
          sledgehammer, a hockey stick shaved into a stake, satchel
          full of car flares, hairspray. Stan is still processing
          what's going on. Mixed with their formal wear for the event,
          they look mildly ridiculous.
                         
                                             STAN
                    Hold on. How are we-?
                         
          Richie hands Stan a chainsaw.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Happy bar mitzvah, Jason. Bet you
                    didn't put this sucker on your gift
                    list.
                         
          Someone pounds at the door.
                         
                              ZACH (O.S.)
                    Will, what are you doing in there?
                    Open up.
                         
          Everyone looks to Will.   He folds up the map into a backpack.
                         
                                             WILL
                    We need to protect each other Stan.
                    The seven of us is all we have.
                    Together "IT" can't hurt us. I
                    promise.
                         
                                             STAN
                    How do you know?
                         
          More knocking.
                         
                              ZACH (O.S.)
                    Willy, now! We need to talk.
                         
          Will steps up to Stan.
                         
                                             WILL
                    I have faith. Just like you.
                         
          Stan looks to the others, everyone scared but ready for
          battle. Stans steels himself, owning up his chainsaw. The
          door shakes with Zach behind it.
                                                                   114.
                         
                         
                                             ZACH
                    Damn it, Will!
                         
          Will opens the back window and the kids slip out.
                         
                         
          EXT. OLD IRONWORKS - DAY
                         
          The losers -- ALL 7 OF THEM -- stand on the threshold of the
          Old Ironworks cellar hold, the very same one PATRICK
          HOCKSTETTLER died in... a yawning chasm of mud, pools of
          water and hulking, shattered old boilers.
                         
          The rain and wind howls, lightning cracking overhead. Will
          points to a huge SEWER PIPE that juts out of the muck.
                         
                                             WILL
                                       (YELLING)
                    This is our only way into Derry's
                    original sewer system before it was
                    sealed off and modernized.
                         
          BLING!
                         
          A bullet sparks off a iron post next to Will's head.
                         
          Travis, Snatch and Victor stand at the crest of the road
          leading to the factory. Travis has his dad's gun, aimed like
          Dirty Harry at them. He pops off another round, BLANG-PING.
                         
                                               BEN
                    Oh, fuck!
                         
          Will grabs Bev's hand, who grabs Ben's who grab's Eddie's and
          on down the line. They follow Will around the cellar hold to
          a giant conveyor belt toppled against the edge. They scale
          down it into the chasm, bullets pinging around them.
                         
          CLICK CLICK CLICK. Travis runs out of ammo.     He throws the
          gun away and pulls out the bloody knife.
                         
                                             VICTOR
                    Man, this is where Patrick
                    Hockstettler went missing.
                         
                                             SNATCH
                    No way I'm going down there.
                         
          Travis glares at Snatch, PENNYWISE appearing near the boy in
          a flash of lightning.
                         
          Travis lunges with the knife and plunges it into Snatch's
          tummy. Victor watches in horror.

                       Still have second thoughts?
                         
          Victor shakes his head no. Snatch stumbles back and plunges
          into the darkness of the cellar hold...
                         
                         
          INT. CELLAR HOLD - SAME
                         
          SMACK! Snatch's lifeless body slams into the muck right in
          front of Will and the others.
                         
                                                EDDIE

          They dart into the blackness of the huge, rusty pipe.
                         
          Travis turns back to Victor, a dull craze in his eyes.   He
          gestures to the conveyor the kids climbed down.
                         
                                                   TRAVIS

          The losers follow Will, who uses his dad's map to lead them
          deeper and deeper into the sewers which roar and chime with
          rushing water. They turn a corner and come to...
                         
          A DEAD END
                         
          The stream of water seems to disappear under the stone wall
          there. Everyone is terrified.

          He shines his light on something in the corner...
                         
                                                WILL
                       There's suppose to be a tunnel
                       here. The last tunnel that's shown
                       on the map.
                         
          It's a SHOE.    Eddie comes over it.
                                                                  116.

                    Dorsey's other shoe.
                         
          Stan sweeps his flashlight up the wall.   What he finds makes
          Richie spring back.

          Scrawled in blood on the stones is a warning:

          Footsteps echo from behind them.

          Stan finds a loose stone.
                         
                                              STAN

          INT. SEWER TUNNELS - DAY
                         
          Travis and Victor race down the tunnels after them. They
          turn the corner and come to the dead end, a pile of stones
          kicked out from a BLACK HOLE. Travis kneels down and looks
          into it. He can see Will and the gang's FLASHLIGHTS...

          INT. BLACK HOLE - DAY
                         
          Will and the others slosh on their hands and knees down the
          hole, with roots and bursting through its stone ribs.
                         
          It grows narrower and narrower to the point of complete and
          utter claustrophobia. Mike looks back past Ben and sees...
                         
          Two shadowy figures crawling toward them.
                                                                 117.

                    Hurry!
                         
          Will, leading them, comes to a SMALL CORKSCREW in a tangle of
          roots blocking them they all have to wrench their way around.
                         
          Ben, the last of the group, GETS STUCK.
                         
                                             BEN

          Travis bears down, his knife clenched in his teeth.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    I'm gonna carve you up, tits. I'm
                    going to stick this blade right up
                    your asshole and split you in two.
                    Feed your ass fat to the friggin'
                    pigs.
                         
          He starts squealing like a pig. Ben is freaked. Two pair of
          hands grab Ben's arms and yank hard. He wrenches through the
          corkscrew and stumbles out into...
                         
                         
          INT. MEMBRANOUS CHAMBER - DAY
                         
          A thin membrane floats over gelatinous water, very delicate,
          almost skin like. Underneath, thousands of spiders swim, nest
          and writhe. He can actually feel their legs push against the
          underside of the layer.
                         
                                             BEN

                    Don't jiggle it too much, whatever
                    you do.

                    We don't want it to tear.
                         
          Ben freezes, the spiders knowing he's there and gathering
          under his butt. Bev, Stan, Eddie and Mike look on from solid
          ground on the other side of the membrane.

          Ben, Mike and Will take off their sneaks and crawl across the
          membrane with great care. SPIDERS GATHER wherever they press
          a knee or hand, the whole thing sloshing like a water bed.
                                                                  118.

          Travis and Victor get to the corkscrew pass. There's no way
          Travis, huge compared to the other kids, will fit through.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    No! No no no no! Fuck!
                         
                                             VICTOR
                    We'll never fit. We've gotta go
                    back.
                         
          Travis grabs Victor by the scruff of the neck. A crooked,
          bloodthirsty look flashes across his ugly face.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    I need to hear them squeal.   Now
                    you'll fit.
                         
          He puts the knife into Victor's hand and points to keep
          going. For a split second Victor thinks about stabbing him,
          but he's too scared. He squeezes his rangy frame through the
          roots into...
                         
                         
          INT. MEMBRANOUS CHAMBER - DAY
                         
          Victor flops out onto the membrane just as Ben, Will and Mike
          join the others on firm ground.
                         
                                              EDDIE
                    Hurry.
                         
          Victor sees them.   He's freaked.
                         
                                             VICTOR
                    No. Guys. Wait! Please! Travis
                    has gone insane. I'm not trying to
                    hurt you, just...
                         
          Now noticing the room he is in, realizing the danger.
                         
                                             VICTOR (CONT'D)
                    Take me with you!
                         
          Everyone looks to Will, who sees something on the membrane
          that gives him pause.
                         
                                              WILL
                    Victor.
                         
          Will is pointing. Beverly follows his eyes to the knife in
          Victor's hand, which has PUNCTURED THE MEMBRANE.
                                                                 119.

                                   OH NO-
                         
          Spiders spill out onto it's surface.
                         
                                             VICTOR
                    Oh god oh god!
                         
          He freaks, spiders jumping on him, his motion only ripping
          the membrane more. It finally tears and Victor plunges
          beneath the membrane, spiders devouring him, Victor screaming
          in agony as they fill his mouth.
                         
          Horrified, Will and the others run for their lives.

          Travis hears the screaming, enjoying it.
                         
                                             TRAVIS
                    Good. That's good, Vic.      Kill `em.
                    Kill `em all!
                         
          Suddenly spiders start spilling out from behind the roots of
          the corkscrew. Travis screams, and kicks them away. But
          more come. Freaked, he retreats back to the sewer tunnels.

          Will, Ben, Bev, Mike, Eddie, Stan and Richie stumble from the
          dark into a massive, soaring, subterranean Pantheon-like
          hall, sewer water streaming past their feet...
                         
          In the center of the floor is a massive OCULUS, open to what
          appears to be the edge of INFINITE SPACE. The water from the
          sewers flows down into seven channels around this opening,
          ending at...
                         
          SEVEN WATERFALLS THAT FALL UPWARDS into a reflecting pool
          that covers much of the ceiling, surrounding a stone island
          with a CRYPT TYPE STRUCTURE.
                         
          The whole cavern seems to be lit from within, a sickly,
          pulsing ambient light coming from everywhere and nowhere.

          Will heads toward the edge of the oculus, where the
          waterfalls stream up.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Don't get too close to the edge,
                    Will.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    It's up there isn't it?   That's
                    where "IT" sleeps.
                         
          Pointing at the reflecting pool.
                         
                                             STAN
                    You mean Pennywise.
                         
                                             WILL
                    It doesn't matter what it calls
                    itself. What matters is it's
                    afraid to show us what it really
                    is. Which means we can beat it.
                         
          Will sees Beverly over by one of the waterfalls.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Guess I'm going first again?
                         
                                             WILL
                    Beverly, wait-!
                         
          She jumps into the waterfall and it sweeps her up up up to
          the ceiling.
                         
          Will and the boys swap holy shit looks.   Ben jumps in after
          her, then Will, Mike, and Stan.
                         
          Richie looks to Eddie, who has the same terrified look as at
          the quarry. He holds out his hand.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    You still afraid of a little grey
                    water?
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    You still wear diapers at night?
                         
          Eddie grabs Richie's hand and they jump into the waterfall
          together. They are swept up up up into...
                                                                  121.
                         
                         
          INT. THE REFLECTING POOL ON THE CEILING - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Plunging into the pool with the others. For a moment they
          all flap and kick under water, unsure which way is up, then
          Bev grabs them both and pulls them to the surface.
                         
          They're upside down now, the oculus opening to space below
          them, gravity seeming to work by its own rules in here..
                         
                                             WILL
                    We all here?
                         
          Richie looks back where they just "fell" from.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Mind equals blown right now.
                         
          The camera flips around and THE WORLD RIGHTS ITSELF, the
          oculus now above. The pool, which seemed small before, is
          now enormous -- like a dark, brooding lake -- the crypt
          island very far from them.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    This is nothing like what it looked
                    like from below.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    It's in our head. All the stuff we
                    see. It's like the allergies my
                    mom said I had. We make it real.
                         
                                              STAN
                    We do.   Or IT?
                         
                                             WILL
                    Guys, the island.    Let's swim.
                         
          They splash toward the crypt island. Ben is the first to
          feel something brush past his leg. A replay of the quarry.
                         
                                             BEN
                    Not funny, Richie.
                         
          He looks back and sees no one.   Richie is a couple of lengths
          to his left.
                         
                                              RICHIE
                    What?
                         
          Ben suddenly realizes.   Bev also feels something on her foot.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    The water. There's something in
                    the water with us.
                                                                  122.
                         
                         
          Suddenly a WORMY TENTACLE extends from the water behind Mike.
          Will sees it and whacks it away with his baseball bat.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Hurry!
                         
          The kids hustle it freestyle across the pool for the island.
                         
          WE PULL BACK WIDE TO SEE a monstrously big, faintly outlined
          starfish-like creature with an orange glowing eye, lurking in
          the depths of the reflecting pool.
                         
          Will, then Bev, then Richie dodge a tentacle and all get to
          the island. Stan is not far behind, with Mike, Eddie and Ben
          taking the rear, swatting back more tentacles.
                         
          From under Stan the ORANGE EYE APPEARS, the dark water around
          him suddenly aglow. He looks down into it and it becomes
          clear the eye is really a mouth, and the orange is coming
          from deep inside its bowels -- THE DEADLIGHTS.
                         
          Stan looks directly into them and is mesmerized, so much so
          that he stops swimming.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    Stan what are you doing!
                         
          Paralyzed, Stan starts to sink toward the deadlights when
          Mike, shielding his eyes, grabs Stan and swims him back to
          the surface.
                         
          All the kids give cover with their weapons -- shooting
          flares, swinging the sledgehammer, impaling with the stake,
          using the hubcap as a shield -- so that Mike, helped by Ben
          and Eddie, can drag Stan onto the island.
                         
                                     EDDIE                             BEVERLY
          Stan? Stan, are you okay?       Stan!
                         
          He stares blankly ahead, as if his mind was wiped blank.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    Stan, it's us. You in there buddy?
                         
          Another tentacle squirms out of the water toward them. Ben
          shoots it with a crossbow. It goes slithering back in.
                         
                                             BEN
                    Guys. I don't think this is the
                    best place to hang out right now.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Stanley, snap out of it.
                                                                 123.
                         
                         
          Stan blinks conscious.   He looks at them all.
                         
                                             STAN
                    Where am I?
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    The worst and only bar mitzvah
                    party you will ever have.
                         
          They help Stan to his feet. Mike looks back over his shoulder
          for the monster.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    Guys, the water thing.    IT's gone.
                         
          Indeed, the reflecting pool is placid as ice.
                         
          Will looks back to the crypt, an obsidian stone heptagon-
          shaped structure the size of one of Mike's killing pens.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Maybe. Or just changing into
                    something else.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    What do you mean?
                         
                                             WILL
                    It's using our fears against us.
                    It wants us to be afraid.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Because we'll taste better.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    And that's supposed to rally us,
                    Will?
                         
                                             WILL
                    We have to stick together, to help
                    each other against that kind of
                    fear you only have when you're
                    alone. Alright?
                         
          They all nod and follow Will onto the structure, starry deep
          space through the oculus visible over their shoulders. They
          come to a child-sized TRAP DOOR with an ancient, cosmic
          marking. The only way in or out.
                         
          WILL PUTS HIS HAND ON THE LATCH
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    Ready?
                                                                  124.
                         
                         
          The kids steal themselves, weapons ready. Mike hammers a
          clip into the stone and ties a rope to it. Nods all around.
                         
          WILL TURNS THE LATCH
                         
          The door creaks open. Nothing but pure blackness inside.
          Mike throws down the rope. Will looks at Bev.
                         
                                                WILL (CONT'D)
                     My turn.
                         
          Will takes a breath, drops in...
                         
                         
          INT. IT'S CRYPT - DAY
                         
          Will shimmies down about 5 feet of rope and lights a car
          flare, illuminating the chamber in a blood red pall. The
          walls inside are rough, like the surface of a meteor.
                         
          Directly under the trapdoor is a fountain like hole in the
          floor open to the reflecting pool. Floating on the water is
                         
          GEORGIE'S PAPER BOAT
                         
          Pennywise emerges from the shadows behind Will, clinging to
          the wall, joints all turned and wrong, like a spider.
                         
                                              PENNYWISE
                     Welcome to the circus, Willy.
                         
          SLAM!
                         
          The trapdoor slams shut and slices the rope. Will falls to
          the floor, flare falling into the water. It dims but doesn't
          go out.
                         
          It's near PITCH BLACK. Just Will and Pennywise. He can hear
          his friends banging on the door, calling for him but can't
          see anything.
                         
          There's scuffling all around him. Close. Will dives into
          the water for the flare. Rises. Sweeps it around.
                         
          NOTHING.
                         
                                              WILL
                     I'm not afraid of you, clown.
                         
                                              PENNYWISE
                     Your brother wasn't afraid either.
                         
          A PAIR OF ORANGE EYES GLOW ABOVE HIM, IN THE DARK.   Will
          can't see him.
                                                                    125.
                         
                         
                                             PENNYWISE (CONT'D)
                    Not until I chewed his little
                    muscles up.
                         
          Will turns just in time for the eyes to recede into the
          black. The pounding on the trap door has stopped.
                         
                                               WILL
                    Guys?
                         
          PENNYWISE LUNGES FROM THE CEILING
                         
                                               WILL (CONT'D)
                    Ahhhh!
                         
          Will drops his bag of flares and scrambles off, tripping over
          the hole in the floor, leg sloshing in the pool.
                         
          Glimpses of Pennywise scuffling in the dark like a spider.
                         
          Will finds a corner, the flare running out of spark. He
          waves it this way and that, illuminating the dark in front of
          him. Swinging his baseball bat wildly at shadows.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    Come out from the dark then. Come
                    out from behind that stupid mask
                    and show me what you really are.
                    C'mon!
                         
          Will looks at the last light of his flare, waiting for the
          end. He looks the bat in his clutch only to see it's morphed
          into...
                         
          A BOY'S SEVERED ARM
                         
          He throws it away into the darkness.   The flare goes out.
                         
                         PITCH BLACK
                         
                                             PENNYWISE
                    Ooooh I'd love to, Will. I'd just
                    love to show you my deadlights.
                    Only you wouldn't understand. And
                    I need you to, Willy, I really
                    really need you to understand
                    what's going to happen to you.
                    What it means for a little kiddie
                    like you... to float.
                         
          A light seems to emanate from the pool underneath them,
          illuminating the space, illuminating...
                         
          PENNYWISE, STANDING IN THE CORNER
                                                                 126.
                         
                         
          Will sees all of "IT" now. From his bare crusty feet to his
          bald head. His claw-like hands and his emaciated acrobat-
          like body. He floats just a few inches over the stone floor.
                         
          Will's eyes fall to the baseball bat half-way between them.
          He lunges for it, Pennywise knocking it away. The clown
          seizes his neck, smiles hungrily, bares his twisted fangs.
                         
                                             WILL
                    I'm sorry, Georgie.
                         
          Pennywise goes for a bite and...
                         
                         THWACK
                         
          An arrow shoots through it's face. The injured clown recoils
          away. Bev flops out from the reflecting pool, followed by
          Ben, Richie, Stan, Eddie, and Mike.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Break into our homes, we break into
                    yours.
                         
          Pennywise pulls the arrow from his bloody mouth.
                         
                                             BEN
                    Charge!
                         
          THE LOSERS ATTACK PENNYWISE WITH EVERYTHING THEY GOT
                         
          Mike with crow bar, Stan with chainsaw, Ben with a hub cap
          shield and sledgehammer, Richie with his hockey stick stake,
          Eddie with a nail gun. Will grabs his bat and joins them.
                         
          Pennywise tries to fend off this "Lord of the Flies"
          rebellion, becoming bigger, fiercer, more grotesque, but the
          kids are too much. Just when they have "IT" bleeding and
          backed into a corner for the death blow...
                         
                                             PENNYWISE
                    Wait!
                         
          Will grabs Ben's sledgehammer. The creature that looks up at
          them isn't Pennywise but... GEORGIE
                         
                                             PENNYWISE/GEORGIE
                    Please, Willy. Please don't hurt
                    me.
                         
                                             WILL
                    You're not Georgie.
                                                                 127.
                         
                         
                                            PENNYWISE/GEORGIE
                    I am. I'm in here, Willy. We all
                    are. This is the place we float.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Will, it's a trick.
                         
                                             PENNYWISE/GEORGIE
                    It's not your fault Willy. Not
                    you're fault I'm stuck here. But
                    you're hurting us all.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    It's trying to get to you, Will.
                    Kill it. Kill it now.
                         
                                              WILL
                    No!   I have to think.
                         
                                             PENNYWISE/GEORGIE
                    Mom and dad they should know. They
                    should know it's not your fault.
                    I'll tell `em. I'll tell `em as
                    long as you don't hurt us anymore.
                         
          Will is confused. This is the one thing he wanted to hear.
          Beverly hands him his satchel with the car flares.
                         
                                             BEVERLY
                    Finish him, Will. For all of us.
                    For Georgie.
                         
          Will looks to the scared little boy on the ground.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    I'm taking this fucker out.
                         
                                              WILL
                    No.
                         
          Will grabs his stake away. He turns to Georgie.   Kneels
          down. Takes his wet little head in his hands.
                         
                                             WILL (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't go
                    out there with you. I'm sorry I
                    was sick.
                         
                                             GEORGIE
                    It's okay, Willy. I know.
                    Everything'll be okay.
                         
             WILL DOES THE CALL BACK AND SOMETHING IN THE WAY GEORGIE
          RESPONDS SNAPS WILL OUT OF HIS STUPOR. GEORGIE'S GONE   
                                                                     128.
                         
                         
                                                WILL
                    Hairspray.
                         
          Bev sprays it through his lit flare.   Torching Georgie.
                         
                                              GEORGIE
                    No!   No Willy! Please!
                         
          GEORGIE REVERTS BACK TO PENNYWISE, screaming horribly and
          lunging at the kids one last time. IT finally gives up,
          slumping to the floor dead, a black charred clownish corpse.
                         
          Richie touches the remains and they deflates, almost as if a
          balloon.
                         
          The trapdoor above them blows away, as if it were sucked off
          by a cyclone, out of the oculus, and into what looks like the
          stars of outer space.
                         
                                             EDDIE
                    Did we kill it?
                         
          Will isn't sure, he looks at the rest of them.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    You did it, Will.
                         
          Bev hugs him.   Ben watches, enviously.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    It's miller ti--
                         
          Suddenly the GRAVITY SPELL WEARS OFF and the kids all fall to
          the ceiling of the stone crypt. Bev almost falls out into
          space, caught by Ben just in time.
                         
          The water from the waterfalls and from the reflecting pool
          all collapse back toward the floor, along with some of the
          stones in the crypt around them, which begins to crumble.
                         
          At first the losers hang on, afraid to fall, but eventually
          they lose grip and fall toward the oculus, which has begun to
          fill up with the water from the falls and reflecting pool.
                         
          They all plunge safely into the new pool below, Will's foot
          kicking out the bottom of it into outer space before being
          pulled back by Stan.
                         
                                             WILL
                    We've got to get out of here.
                                                                  129.
                         
                         
          INT. DERRY SEWERS - DAY
                         
          The losers hurry their way out of the sewers, storm water
          quickly rising around them. Will leads the way with a car
          flare. They come to another dead-end grate.
                         
                                                RICHIE
                    Shit!
                         
                                             WILL
                    We'll get out. C'mon.
                         
                         
          INT. ANOTHER PIPE - LATER
                         
          They continue to look for a way out, the water now up to
          their chests. The losers look cold, lost, and in despair.
                         
                                              STAN
                    We're going to drown down here
                    aren't we?
                         
                         
                                        EDDIE                           MIKE
          I'm so cold.                      All this water. It's still
                                            going to win.
                         
                                             WILL
                    No. I don't know--
                         
                                             BEN

                    Guys, stop it. Focus.
                         
          Everyone turns to Bev. Their muse. Their light.
                         
          SHE TAKES EDDIE'S FACE IN HER HANDS

                                                                 130.
                         
                         
          EXT. PENOBSCOT RIVER - DAY
                         
          One by one the kids shoot out of a STORM PIPE into the
          PENOBSCOT RIVER, just like Georgie's paper boat. They pop up
          like tops, blinking owlishly against the daylight.
                         
          The sky is blue.   The storm has passed.
                         
                         
          EXT. RIVERBANK - DUSK
                         
          Will, Bev, Mike, Ben, Richie, Eddie and Stan slump soaked,
          shivering, and exhausted on the embankment. Derry is in full
          view across the river, a red ball setting behind it.
                         
          They gather themselves on the bank, breathing hard as the
          adrenaline of survival courses through their veins.
                         
                                             RICHIE
                    Now can we celebrate?
                         
                                              BEVERLY
                    Will?
                         
          Stan sees an OBJECT GLITTER in the sunlight. He picks it up,
          face sober and thoughtful -- an old GLASS COKE BOTTLE. He
          takes it by the neck, shatters it against a rock, and
                         
          LOOKS TO WILL, NODDING
                         
          Will knows exactly what this means. He steps up to Stan, who
          SLASHES Will'S PALM with the shard. One by one the others
          approach, Stan slashing everyone's palms, does his own last.
                         
                                             WILL
                    Swear, guys. Swear if IT isn't
                    dead, if it ever returns, we'll
                    come back and fight it together.
                         
          They all clasp hands and lock eyes. A BLOOD OATH IS SWORN.
                         
                         
          INT. TRAVIS BOWERS HOUSE - DUSK
                         
          Travis, hair now SHOCK WHITE, expression blank and broken,
          sits in his chair in front of white fuzz of the TV. His
          father's corpse is still on the floor, blood matted
          everywhere. POUNDING ON THE FRONT DOOR.
                                                                    131.

          Chief Borton and other Derry cops frog march Travis out of
          the house in cuffs through a scene of POLICE, NEWS REPORTERS,
          and a CORONER CARTING OUT A BODY BAG.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Mike races past nurses and doctors, a swell of optimism
          building with every stride. He turns the corner into...
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Leroy's bed is empty. His mom is packing up his dad's things.
          She looks up, tears in her eyes. Mike is devastated.
                         
                                             MIKE
                    But we beat It.    We beat the
                    cancer.

          Mike's mom takes him into her arms.
                         
                                             MIKE'S MOM
                    He's in a better place, Mikey. I
                    know it's hard to believe. But you
                    have to. Remember what your father
                    always said...

          Leroy shows Mike a baby lamb, freshly born from its mother's
          womb.
                         
                                             LEROY
                    See son, everything has a cycle.
                    Just when you think the world
                    couldn't get any colder, something
                    good always grows.

          Mike holds his mother tight, remembering, tears rolling down
          his cheeks. A PIANO BEGINS TO PLAY...
                                                                   132.

          Fur Elise. Will recognizes it as he comes up the front walk.
          It comes from INSIDE HIS HOUSE. He races inside, hopeful,
          past a box of Georgie's toys left out on the sidewalk.

          Will stands at the curb with his gang -- Richie, Ben, Bev,
          Eddie, Stan, and Mike. They hand him a present.
                         
                                             BEVERLY

                    I had to mow like five hundred
                    lawns. Stan smoked the clippings.
                         
                                      STAN                            BEN
          What does that even mean?       You gonna open it?
                         
          Will does. Inside is a VINTAGE PENTAX CAMERA.

          They pull out of the driveway, camera on Will's lap. Zach and
          Sharon smile back affectionately from the front seat.
                         
          Will turns to see his friends wave bon voyage with their
          SCARRED HANDS. A reminder of an oath to be kept.

          As Will drives off we RISE UP UP UP over the intersection
          Georgie was killed, HIGH OVER DERRY, until we come to...
                         
          A floating RED BALLOON
                         
          It POPS!
